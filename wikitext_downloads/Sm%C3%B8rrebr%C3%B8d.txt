'''{{lang|da|Smørrebrød}}''' ({{IPA|da|ˈsmɶɐ̯ˌpʁœðˀ}}; originally {{lang|da|smør og brød}}, "butter and bread"<ref>{{cite web|title=Word origin of "smørrebrød"|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/smorrebrod|website=Collins Dictionary}}</ref>), '''smørbrød''' "butter bread" ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]), or '''smörgås''' {{IPA|sv|ˈsmœrˌɡoːs|}} "butter goose" ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]), is a traditional [[Open sandwich|open-faced sandwich]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Scandinavia on $20 a day|page=20|language=en|author=Stanley Mills Hagart, Darwin Porter|date=1979}}</ref> in the [[cuisine of Denmark|cuisines of Denmark]], [[Cuisine of Norway|Norway]] and [[Cuisine of Sweden|Sweden]] that usually consists of a piece of buttered {{lang|da|[[rugbrød]]}} (a dense, dark [[rye bread]]) topped with commercial or homemade [[cold cut]]s, pieces of [[meat]] or [[Fish as food|fish]], [[cheese]] or [[Spread (food)|spreads]], and garnishes.

==Bread==
Bread is a very important part of the Scandinavian diet, primarily {{lang|da|rugbrød}}, which is [[sourdough]] rye bread. It is a dark, heavy bread which is often bought sliced, in varieties from light-coloured rye to very dark, and from refined to whole-grain.<ref>{{cite book | last=Mellish | first=K.X. | title=How to Live in Denmark: A Humorous Guide for Foreigners and Their Danish Friends | publisher=Primedia E-launch LLC | year=2014 | isbn=978-1-63315-290-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nMaSBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT25 | access-date=February 7, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Sheraton | first=M. | title=1,000 Foods To Eat Before You Die: A Food Lover's Life List | publisher=Workman Publishing Company | year=2015 | isbn=978-0-7611-8306-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1f-lAwAAQBAJ&pg=800 | access-date=February 7, 2015 | page=0}}</ref>  Some toppings are served on {{lang|da|franskbrød}} ('French bread'), a very light, crusty wheat bread. The bread is usually buttered, though for some variants, a spread of lard is customary.

==Toppings==

Traditional toppings include pickled herring (plain, spiced or curried), slightly sweeter than Dutch or German herring; thinly sliced cheese in many varieties; sliced cucumber, tomato and boiled eggs; pork liver-paste; dozens of types of cured or processed meat in thin slices, or smoked fish such as salmon; mackerel in tomato sauce; pickled cucumber; boiled egg, and rings of red onion. Mayonnaise mixed with peas, sliced boiled asparagus and diced carrot, called {{lang|da|italiensk salat}} ('Italian salad'), remoulade or other thick sauces often top the layered open sandwich, which is usually eaten with utensils. It is customary to pass the dish of sliced bread around the table, and then to pass around each dish of toppings, from which people help themselves.<ref>[https://www.carolinescooking.com/danish-smorrebrod/ Danish Smorrebrod (Open sandwiches) with remoulade in Carolines Cooking]</ref>

More festive meals can be loosely divided into courses: fish toppings first (such as herring, shrimp, or smoked salmon) followed by cold cuts and salads, and finally cheese with bread or crackers and fruit. One or several warm dishes are often served with the meats on special occasions, such as breaded plaice filet, fried {{lang|da|[[Medisterpølse|medister]]|italic=yes}} sausage, {{lang|da|[[frikadeller]]}} with pickled red cabbage, or {{lang|da|mørbradbøf}} (pork tenderloin with sauteed onions or a creamy mushroom sauce). Toppings change with the seasons and some are mostly associated with Easter or Christmas lunches, like [[head cheese]] and {{lang|da|æbleflæsk}} (lit. 'apple pork', roast pork or bacon in apple sauce).  Summer offers lighter fare such as smoked mackerel, {{lang|da|sommersalat}} (lit. 'summer salad', radish and cucumber in a smoked cheese dressing), new potatoes, and freshly peeled shrimp.<ref>[https://whereismyspoon.co/open-faced-sandwiches-smorrebrod-danish-food/ Open faced sandwiches – Smorrebrod – Danish food by Adina in Where is my Spoon ?]</ref>
