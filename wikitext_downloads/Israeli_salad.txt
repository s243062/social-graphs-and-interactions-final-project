'''Israeli salad''' ({{langx|he|סָלָט יְרָקוֹת יִשְׂרְאֵלִי|salat yerakot yisra'eli|Israeli vegetable salad}}) is a chopped [[salad]] of finely diced [[tomato]], [[onion]], [[cucumber]], and [[Bell pepper|bell]] or [[Chili pepper|chili]] peppers.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Book of Jewish Food: An Odyssey from Samarkand to New York|author=Claudia Roden|publisher=Knopf|year=1996|page=248}}</ref><ref name="Marks 2010">{{cite book|first1=Gil|last1=Marks|title=Encyclopedia of Jewish Food|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gFK_yx7Ps7cC&pg=PT870|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|date=2010|isbn=9780544186316|via=Google Books}}</ref> It has been described as the "most well-known national dish of [[Israel]]",<ref>''Israel,'' Jill DuBois and Mair Rosh, Marshall Cavendish  Pub., 2003 . p. 130</ref><ref>"Jerusalem Diaries II: What's Really Happening in Israel, Judy Lash Balint.

It was adopted by [[Aliyah|Jewish immigrants]] to the Levant in the late 19th century, who found the locally grown Kirby cucumbers and tomatoes in popular [[Arab salad|local salad]]. It was popularized in the [[kibbutz]]im, where the Jewish farmers had local fresh produce at hand.<ref name="Marks 2010"/>

The name ''Israeli Salad'' is used mainly outside of Israel.<ref name="Marks 2010"/> Within Israel, it is commonly referred to as ''salat katzutz'' ({{langx|he|סָלָט קָצוּץ}}, "chopped salad"), as well as ''salat aravi'' ({{langx|he|סָלָט עֲרָבִי}}, "[[Arab salad]]"), or ''salat yerakot'' ({{langx|he|סָלָט יְרָקוֹת}}, "vegetable salad").<ref name="Marks 2010"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.israel-food-guide.com/israeli-salad.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201052522/http://israel-food-guide.com/israeli-salad.html |archive-date=1 February 2009 |title=Tasty Israeli Salad |website=Israel Food Guide.com |access-date=27 November 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="LATIMES"/>

==Description==
Israeli salad is made of chopped raw tomato, onion and cucumber, and can also include [[bell pepper|pepper]], [[carrot]], [[scallion]], [[leaf vegetable|leafy greens]] and [[parsley]]. The salad is dressed with either fresh [[lemon juice]] or [[olive oil]], or both. [[Za'atar]] and [[yogurt]] are very common dressings at breakfast while [[sumac]] and [[tahini]] are common the rest of the day. Generally, the cucumbers are not peeled. The ability to chop the tomatoes and cucumbers into the "finest, most perfect dice" is considered a mark of status among many [[kibbutz]] cooks.<ref>Mouth Wide Open: A Cook and His Appetite, John Thorne, Tor/Forge, 2007, p. 190</ref> Traditional recipes do not include lettuce.<ref name="Marks 2010"/>

In Israeli restaurants and cafes, Israeli salad is served as an independent side dish, as an accompaniment to main dishes, or stuffed in a pita with [[falafel]] or [[shawarma]]. It was a major part of the traditional [[Israeli breakfast]] at home before Western-style breakfast cereals became popular, and today it remains a standard feature at buffet breakfasts at Israeli hotels, as well as in many homes.

==History==
Although cucumbers have an ancient history in the Middle East, tomatoes, native to South America, were not cultivated in the [[Syria region]] until possibly as late as the 19th century, during the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://yourarchives.nationalarchives.gov.uk/index.php?title=British_Consuls_in_Aleppo | title = British Consuls in Aleppo – Your Archives | publisher = Yourarchives.nationalarchives.gov.uk | date = 26 January 2009 | access-date = 2 April 2009 | archive-date = 8 September 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110908042910/http://yourarchives.nationalarchives.gov.uk/index.php?title=British_Consuls_in_Aleppo | url-status = dead }}</ref> In the 1940, [[Beit Alfa|Kibbutz Beit Alfa]] pioneered a variety of cucumber named after the Kibbutz, which became the standard Israeli cucumber used in this salad.<ref name="FoodCI"/>

Food historian [[Gil Marks]] describes how Jewish immigrants in the late 19th century first encountered the cucumber and tomato salad in then-Ottoman Palestine, and traces its presence there back to the Turkish ''[[çoban salatası]]'' (shepherd's salad).<ref name="Marks 2010"/> Since the cucumbers and tomatoes were familiar vegetables to both European and Middle Eastern immigrants, they were quickly incorporated into their common diet. The Kibbutz breakfast incorporated a variety of salad and fresh vegetables. Adopted and popularized by the [[kibbutz]]im across the land, this salad latter migrated to all areas of the Israeli cuisine.<ref name="FoodCI">{{cite book|title=Food Cultures of Israel: Recipes, Customs, and Issues|author=Michael Ashkenazi|publisher=ABC-CLIO|date=2020|pages=35, 39, 87}}</ref>
Variations on the basic recipe have been made by the different Jewish communities that immigrated to the country. For example, [[Indian Jews|Jews from India]] prepare it with the addition of finely chopped [[ginger]] and green [[chili pepper]]s, [[Mizrahi Jews|North African Jews]] may add [[preserved lemon]] peel and [[cayenne pepper]], and [[Bukharan Jews]] chop the vegetables extremely finely and use vinegar, without oil, in the dressing.<ref>[[Claudia Roden|Roden, Claudia]], ''The Book of Jewish Food: An Odyssey from Samarkand to New York'', New York, Knopf (1997) {{ISBN|0-394-53258-9}}, pg. 248</ref>

In an interview with the [[BBC]], Israeli culinary journalist Gil Hovav said that the Israeli salad is in fact a Palestinian Arab salad.<ref>[https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/30_03_08_cooking_in_the_danger_zone_srs_3_israel_palestine_territories.pdf BBC Cooking in the Danger Zone: Israel and Palestinian Territories, Page 6] "this salad that we call an Israeli Salad, actually it’s an Arab salad, Palestinian salad….”</ref> The idea that what is known in New York delis as "Israeli salad" stems from a Palestinian rural salad is agreed on by [[Joseph Massad]], a Palestinian professor of Arab Politics at [[Columbia University]], as an example of the appropriation of Palestinian and Syrian foods such as [[hummus]], [[falafel]], and [[tabbouleh]] by Israel as "national dishes".<ref>Joseph Massad, "The Persistence of the Palestinian Question," in ''Empire & Terror: Nationalism/postnationalism in the New Millennium,'' Begoña Aretxaga, University of Nevada, Reno Center for Basque Studies, University of Nevada Press, 2005 p. 63</ref>
