An '''arepa''' ({{IPA|es|aˈɾepa}}) is a type of [[flatbread]] made of ground [[maize]] dough that may be stuffed with a filling, eaten in northern parts of [[South America]] since [[pre-Columbian]] times, and notable primarily in the cuisine of [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]], but also present in [[Bolivia]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Central America]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/arepa|title= Arepa|date= 19 January 2024}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Recetas, Cocina y Comida|url=https://www.recetas.com.bo/|access-date=2020-11-18|website=recetas com.bo|language=es|archive-date=2020-11-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201125084755/https://www.recetas.com.bo/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Conquer" />

== Origins ==
The {{Lang|es|arepa}} is a [[pre-Columbian]] dish from the area that is now Colombia, Panama and Venezuela.<ref name="Conquer">{{Cite news|title=Arepas Are Conquering The World — But Dying At Home In Venezuela|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/07/26/538515889/arepas-are-conquering-the-world-but-dying-at-home-in-venezuela|access-date=2021-07-17|website=NPR.org|date=26 July 2017|language=en|last1=Puyana|first1=Alejandro|archive-date=2021-07-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210717211245/https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/07/26/538515889/arepas-are-conquering-the-world-but-dying-at-home-in-venezuela|url-status=live}}</ref> Instruments used to make flour for the {{Lang|es|arepas}}, and the clay slabs on which they were cooked, were often found at [[Archaeology of the Americas|archaeological sites in the area]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2020|reason=Which ones?}} Although it has not been specified in which country an ''{{Lang|es|arepa}}'' was cooked for the first time, it has been possible to define the oldest dates of the presence of maize in Colombia and Venezuela.

Throughout its history, the ''{{Lang|es|arepa}}'' has stayed mainly unchanged from the ''{{Lang|es|arepas}}'' that pre-Columbian native peoples would have consumed, making the ''{{Lang|es|arepa}}'' one of the few pre-contact traditions that have remained popular in the years since [[European colonization of the Americas|colonization]].<ref name="Conquer" /> The name ''{{Lang|es|arepa}}'' is related to {{Lang|cuo|erepa}}, the word for 'cornbread' in the [[Cumanagoto language]].<ref name="DNA" />

== Characteristics ==
[[File:Arepa, sabor y tradición del campo -ancient tradition.jpg|thumb|{{Lang|es|Arepas}} being prepared]]
The ''{{Lang|es|arepa}}'' is a flat, round, unleavened patty of soaked, ground kernels of maize, or—more frequently nowadays—maize meal or maize flour.  It can be grilled, baked, fried, boiled, or steamed. The characteristics vary by color, flavor, size, and the food with which it may be stuffed, depending on the region. Simple ''{{Lang|es|arepas}}'' are filled with butter or cheese and baked. Depending on the meal, more filling varieties can be added with combinations of ingredients like beans, meat, avocados, eggs, tomatoes, salad, shrimp, or fish. Fried ''{{Lang|es|arepas}}'' are often consumed in northern South America, filled with white cheese on top and served with fried eggs. Sweet fried ''{{Lang|es|arepas}}'' are another variety often prepared with [[sugarloaf]] ({{Lang|es|papelón}}) and anise ({{Lang|es|anís}}). Venezuelan white cheese is another topping for fried ''arepas'' that can be combined with feta cheese.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Janer|first=Zilkia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KxYTgVXvc3oC&q=arepa&pg=PA28|title=Latino Food Culture|date=2008-03-30|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-08790-5|page=28|language=en}}</ref>

== Production ==
Initially, {{Lang|es|arepa}} flour was made by grinding maize at home. In the 1950s, precooked ''arepa'' flour was invented by Dr. {{ill|Luis Caballero Mejías|es|Luis Caballero Mejías}}, a Venezuelan engineer, and became an instant success. The flour is mixed with water and salt, and occasionally oil, butter, eggs or milk. Because the flour is already cooked, the blend forms into patties easily. After being kneaded and formed, the patties are fried, grilled, or baked. Some varieties of ''arepas'' are made with "peeled" corn using the [[nixtamalization]] process; they are known as ''arepa pelada''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.canalrcn.com/el-desayuno/amp/recetas/receta-arepas-santandereanas-8387/ |title=canalrcn.com |access-date=2020-05-10 |archive-date=2021-08-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210816230545/https://www.canalrcn.com/el-desayuno/amp/recetas/receta-arepas-santandereanas-8387/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

''Arepa'' flour is specially prepared (cooked in water, then dried) for making ''arepas'' and other maize dough-based dishes, such as ''[[hallaca]]s'', ''[[bollo]]s'', ''[[tamale]]s'', ''[[empanada]]s, [[atole]]'' and ''[[chicha]]''. The flour may be called {{Lang|es|masarepa}}'','' {{Lang|es|masa de arepa}}'','' {{Lang|es|masa al instante}}, or {{Lang|es|harina precocida}}. It is not nixtamalized.<ref>The Process Of Nixtamalization, Explained, by Yuka Matsuno. Jan. 18, 2023.

However, in countries such as [[Colombia]], it is not common to reconstitute corn flour as it is in Venezuela. Thus, in [[Colombia]], it is more common to see pre-roasted arepas ready for consumption in stores and supermarkets, giving rise to an industry that in 2019 alone had sales of USD $124 million with companies such as Arepas Sary and [[Alpina Productos Alimenticios]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lozano Garzon |first1=Rolando |title=Gasto en arepas crece 5 % anual y se ubica en $ 505.000 millones |url=https://www.eltiempo.com/economia/sectores/consumo-venezolano-impulsa-crecimiento-de-ventas-de-arepa-en-colombia-379798 |access-date=23 September 2025 |agency=El Tiempo |publisher=June 29th 2019}}</ref>

== Regional varieties ==
The dish is known in multiple cuisines. According to food anthropologist [[Ocarina Castillo]] of the [[Central University of Venezuela]], the dish is likely thousands of years old and originated in the region now occupied by the two countries before [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonizers of the area]] drew borders.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web |last=Wagner |first=James |date=26 November 2024 |title=Colombia and Venezuela Have a Beef: Who Owns the, or Makes the Best, Arepa? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/26/world/americas/colombia-venezuela-arepas-food.html |website=[[New York Times]]}}</ref>

=== Bolivia ===
Bolivian ''arepas'' are made from corn. There are different ways to prepare ''arepas'', but one of the most traditional is the [[Cotoca]] recipe.  Several varieties of ''arepa'' can be found in the country, such as the Cruceña and Andina varieties.

The first record of the existence of arepas dates from about 3,000 years ago in what is currently Colombia.<ref name=Redondo2021/>

The ''arepa'' is an iconic food in [[Colombia]], with some 75 distinct preparation forms. According to a study conducted by the Colombian Academy of Gastronomy, the ''arepa'' is part of the Colombian cultural heritage and can be considered a symbol of national gastronomic unity.<ref name="arepasemana">{{Cite web |url=http://www.semana.com/especiales/articulo/la-arepa/79601-3 |title=La arepa |access-date=11 January 2011 |author=Revista Semana |date=24 June 2006 |archive-date=29 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131129112404/http://www.semana.com/especiales/articulo/la-arepa/79601-3 |url-status=live }} (in Spanish)</ref>

In the [[Paisa (region)|Paisa region]], the ''arepa'' is especially important to the local people and sometimes accompanies all meals of the day. In addition, ''arepas'' are strung into necklaces and placed around the necks of honored dignitaries as a sign of praise. Many varieties of ''arepa'' were introduced from this region.<ref name="arepasemana"/>

In Colombia, the ''arepa'' is sold commercially in neighborhood stores, chain supermarkets, and market plazas and packaged with preservatives as a pre-molded white or yellow corn dough ready to grill or fry at home.<ref name="Arepa Preservation">{{Cite journal |last1=Gamba |first1=Raúl Ricardo |last2=Caro |first2=Carlos Andrés |last3=Martínez |first3=Olga Lucía |last4=Moretti |first4=Ana Florencia |last5=Giannuzzi |first5=Leda |last6=De Antoni |first6=Graciela Liliana |last7= Peláez |first7=Angela León |date=17 October 2016 |title=Antifungal effect of kefir fermented milk and shelf life improvement of corn arepas |journal=International Journal of Food Microbiology |volume=235 |pages=85–92 |doi=10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2016.06.038 |pmid=27447094 |hdl=11336/57193 |hdl-access=free}}</ref> It is also sold in the form of industrialized corn flour that requires hydration before preparation.<ref name="Arepa Corn Flour">{{Cite journal |last1=Hernandez |first1=Blanca |last2=Guerra |first2=Marisa |last3=Rivers |first3=Francisco |date=1999 |title=''Obtención y caracterización de harinas compuestas de endospermo–germen de maíz y su uso en la preparación de arepas'' |journal=Ciencia e Tecnologia de Alimentos = Food Science and Technology (Campinas) |volume=19 |number=2 |pages=194–198 |issn=0101-2061 |doi=10.1590/S0101-20611999000200007 |doi-access=free }}</ref> In addition, ''arepas'' are sold by street vendors, in cafeterias, and in neighborhood stores.

=== Venezuela ===
The ''{{Lang|es|arepa}}'' is a symbol of Venezuelan gastronomy and one of the most common pre-Hispanic foods still popular in [[Venezuela]].<ref name="Conquer" /> The first records of this dish are about 2800 years ago.<ref name=Redondo2021/>

According to a 2015 survey of the Venezuelan people, nearly 70 percent of the nation ate ''{{Lang|es|arepas}}'' regularly.<ref name=Consumo>{{Cite web|title=Venezolanos consumen 12,5 kilos menos de harina de maíz precocida al año|url=http://visionagropecuaria.com.ve/venezolanos-consumen-125-kilos-menos-harina-maiz-precocida-al-ano/|last=Agropecuaria|first=Vision|date=2016-11-22|website=Visión Agropecuaria|language=es-ES|access-date=2020-05-11|archive-date=2021-01-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210119185536/https://visionagropecuaria.com.ve/venezolanos-consumen-125-kilos-menos-harina-maiz-precocida-al-ano/|url-status=live}}</ref> It is common for Venezuelans to eat ''{{Lang|es|arepas}}'' throughout the day, both as snacks and as sides to meals, creating a culture where these [[Maize|corn]] products (Harina PAN) can be found almost everywhere and in specific restaurants called {{Lang|es|areperas}}.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://people.howstuffworks.com/culture-traditions/national-traditions/venezuelan-tradition1.htm |title=How Venezuelan Traditions Work |date=2011-07-25 |work=Traditional Venezuelan Food - How Venezuelan Traditions Work {{!}} HowStuffWorks |access-date=2017-10-24 |language=en |archive-date=2017-10-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025073535/https://people.howstuffworks.com/culture-traditions/national-traditions/venezuelan-tradition1.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> 

The ''{{Lang|es|arepa}}'' is seen as a cornerstone of a [[Venezuelan cuisine|Venezuelan diet]]; prior to the 2015 food shortages, it was estimated that each year the average Venezuelan consumed about 30 kilos of the [[Cornmeal|corn flour]] used to make ''{{Lang|es|arepas}}''.<ref name="Consumo" /> Venezuelan {{Lang|es|arepas}} are commonly filled with a great variety of different fillings, from beef and [[avocado]] to cheese, varying widely by the location of where they are sold and the ingredients that can be obtained.<ref name="Conquer" />

In Venezuela's [[Andes]] region, {{Lang|es|arepas de trigo}} are made with wheat flour rather than cornmeal. These lighter ''{{Lang|es|arepas}}'' are generally eaten as a snack or an accompaniment to heavier meals.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Gackstetter Nichols|first1=Elizabeth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RXgiGsCXdVUC&q=arepa&pg=PA297|title=Venezuela|last2=Morse|first2=Kimberly J.|date=2010-10-14|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-570-9|page=279|language=en}}</ref>

Venezuelan president [[Nicolás Maduro]] "has tried to use arepas as a nationalist rallying point, if not a political tool, claiming the food is from his country alone", according to the ''New York Times''.<ref name=":5" />
