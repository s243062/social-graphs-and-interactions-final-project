A '''cremeschnitte''' ({{langx|de|Cremeschnitte}}, {{langx|hu|krémes}}, {{langx|pl|kremówka, napoleonka}}, {{langx|ro|cremșnit, cremeș, crempita}}, [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] and {{lang-sr-Latn-Cyrl|krempita|кремпита|separator=/}}, {{langx|hr|kremšnita}},<ref>{{cite web | url=http://hjp.znanje.hr/index.php?show=search_by_id&id=elhkWhM%3D&keyword=krem%C5%A1nita | title=Hrvatski jezični portal - Kremšnita | access-date=25 April 2020}}</ref> {{langx|sk|krémeš}}, {{langx|sl|kremna rezina, kremšnita}}), also known as '''vanilla slice''' or '''custard slice''', is a [[custard]] and [[chantilly cream]] cream cake [[dessert]] commonly associated with the former [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]].

==By country==

=== In Australia ===
[[Vanilla slice]] emerged as a variety of one of these similar desserts, but it is unknown which variety or varieties evolved into the modern dish.<ref name="AussieVS">{{cite news |last=Van Dyk |first=Garritt C |date=2023-12-25 |title=As Aussie as vanilla slice: how the delicate European dessert became the snot block of Aussie bakeries |url=https://theconversation.com/as-aussie-as-vanilla-slice-how-the-delicate-european-dessert-became-the-snot-block-of-aussie-bakeries-214378 |access-date=2024-01-19 |work=The Conversation}}</ref><ref name="AroundWorld">{{cite news |last=Noone |first=Yasmin |date=2019-12-06 |title=Around the world in vanilla slice |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/food/article/around-the-world-in-vanilla-slice/7zhmkpcgk |access-date=2024-01-19 |work=SBS Food}}</ref>

===In Slovenia===
In Slovenia, '''kremna rezina''' is commonly associated with the town of [[Bled]], an Alpine tourist destination in northwestern [[Slovenia]]. The cake recipe was brought to the local Hotel Park in 1953 by Ištvan Lukačević, chef of the hotel's confectionery store. He came to Bled from [[Serbia]] (Vojvodina) where a similar cake was already known. As of October 2009, 10 million cream cakes have been baked at the hotel's [[patisserie]] since its invention.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/zabava/zanimivosti/bled-praznovanje-ob-10-milijonti-kremni-rezini/214248 |title=Bled: praznovanje ob 10-milijonti kremni rezini |publisher=RTV Slovenia |language=sl |access-date=2011-01-01 |date=2009-10-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dnevnik.si/novice/neverjetno/1042306103 |title=Deset milijonov originalnih blejskih kremnih rezin |publisher=Dnevnik Newspaper |language=sl |access-date=2011-01-01 |date=2009-10-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vecer.com/clanek2009101005476433 |title=Na Bledu praznujejo desetmilijonto kremšnito |publisher=Večer Newspaper |language=sl |access-date=2011-01-01 |date=2009-10-10}}</ref> The name of the dessert means simply "cream slice". Locals refer to it as '''kremšnita''', from the German word Cremeschnitte, with the same meaning. While the '''kremna rezina''' from Bled celebrated their 10th million piece production, Slaščičarna Lenček, which is located in Domžale, in year 2013 celebrated the 75th anniversary since they have made their first one which is called ''' Lenčkova kremna rezina'''.

===In Croatia===
[[File:Krempita.jpg|thumb|Krempita]]
In Croatia, the two most popular variants are '''Samoborska kremšnita''' from the town of [[Samobor]] and '''Zagrebačka kremšnita''' from the capital, [[Zagreb]]. The extremely popular Samoborska kremšnita is characterized by having a puff pastry top, predominantly custard cream filling (less whipped cream) with meringue and is finished with powdered sugar. Zagrebačka kremšnita has a characteristic chocolate icing instead of the puff pastry top, while maintaining the puff pastry base. The classic recipe for Samoborska kremšnita is considered to be designed by Đuro Lukačić in the early 1950s, based on different earlier variants found in patisseries of Zagreb.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://samoborske-kremsnite.com/2011/06/06/duro-lukacic/ |title=Nastanak |date=6 June 2011 |language=hr |access-date=2012-02-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525090508/http://samoborske-kremsnite.com/2011/06/06/duro-lukacic/ |archive-date=2012-05-25 }}</ref>

===In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia===
In [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Serbia]], and [[Montenegro]], the dish is known as '''krempita''' 'cream pie'. It is usually prepared with [[puff pastry]] dough.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://easteuropeanfood.about.com/od/croatianserbiandesserts/r/krempita.htm | title=Serbian Custard Slice Recipe - Krem Pita | publisher=About.com: Eastern European Food | access-date=8 May 2012 | author=Rolek, Barbara | archive-date=24 March 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324231202/http://easteuropeanfood.about.com/od/croatianserbiandesserts/r/krempita.htm | url-status=dead }}</ref> The filling is usually pure thick custard, less commonly combined with [[meringue]] (whipped egg whites and sugar) creme. A similar recipe with only meringue filling is called [[Šampita]].

=== In Montenegro ===
[[File:Kotor Cremeschnitte - Kotorske krempite 05.jpg|thumb|Kotorske krempite with three layers of dough and two layers of cream]]
In [[Montenegro]], the most famous are the '''Kotorska krempita''' or '''Kotorska pašta''' (Kotor Cremeschnitte). Except for the original recipe, they differ from other crempitas because they are made with three layers of dough and two layers of cream.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kotorska Krempita |url=http://www.topmontenegro.com/kotorska_krempita |access-date=4 August 2020 |work=topmontenegro |date=15 January 2018 |archive-date=27 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200327162007/http://www.topmontenegro.com/kotorska_krempita |url-status=dead }}</ref> The "Kotorska pašta" festival dedicated to this delicacy is held in [[Kotor]] every year.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fešta "Kotorska pašta" čuvar gastro kulture |url=https://www.bokanews.me/featured/festa-kotorska-pasta-cuvar-gastro-kulture/ |access-date=4 August 2020 |work=bokanews.me |date=3 June 2018}}</ref>
