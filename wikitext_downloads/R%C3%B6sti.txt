'''{{Lang|de|Rösti}}''' or '''{{Lang|gsw|rööschti}}''' ({{IPA|gsw|ˈrøːʃti|lang}}) is a [[Swiss cuisine|Swiss dish]] consisting mainly of [[potato]]es, sautéed or shallow-fried in a pan. It was originally a [[breakfast]] dish, commonly eaten by farmers in the [[canton of Bern]] and in parts of the [[canton of Fribourg]], but is now eaten all over [[Switzerland]] and around the world. The [[France|French]] name {{Lang|fr|röstis bernois}} directly refers to the dish's origins. 

Many [[Swiss people]] consider {{Lang|de|rösti}} to be a [[national dish]].<ref name="guardian">{{cite news|last1=Cloake|first1=Felicity|author-link=Felicity Cloake|title=How to cook the perfect rösti|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/oct/13/how-to-cook-perfect-rosti|access-date=19 July 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=13 October 2011}}</ref> Rather than considering it a complete breakfast, lunch or dinner, it is more commonly served to accompany other dishes such as {{Lang|de|Spinat und Spiegelei}} ([[spinach]] and [[fried egg]]s, sunny side up), [[cervelat|cervelas]] or [[Leberkäse|Fleischkäse]]. It is commonly available in Swiss restaurants, as a replacement for the standard side dish of a given meal. {{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Preparation==
{{Lang|de|Rösti}} dishes are made with coarsely [[Grater|grated]] potato, either parboiled or raw.<ref name="guardian"/> {{Lang|de|Rösti}} are most often pan-fried and shaped in the frying pan during cooking, but they can also be baked in the oven. Depending on the frying technique, [[oil]], [[butter]], [[cheese]], or another fat may be added (and usually [[salt]] and [[Black pepper|pepper]]). The grated potatoes are shaped into rounds or patties, usually measuring between {{convert|3|and|12|cm|0|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|1|and|2|cm|1|abbr=on}} thick.{{Citation needed|reason=Rösti are never 3cm in diameter, and often much larger than 12cm. They are usually the size of the frying pan they are cooked in, around 20-30cm.|date=August 2020}} 

Although basic {{Lang|de|rösti}} consists of nothing but potato, a number of additional ingredients are sometimes added, such as [[bacon]], [[onion]], cheese, [[apple]] or fresh [[herb]]s. This is usually considered to be a regional touch.

==Cultural significance==
In Swiss popular cultural ethos, {{Lang|de|rösti}} are predominantly eaten in German-speaking regions, although they can be found easily elsewhere in the country. {{Lang|de|Rösti}} dishes are portrayed as a stereotypical part of the Swiss-Germanic culture, as opposed to Latin culture. The geographic border separating the French and German-speaking parts of the country is therefore commonly referred to as the ''[[Röstigraben]]'': literally the '{{Lang|de|rösti}} ditch'.
