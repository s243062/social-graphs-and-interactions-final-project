A '''Sunday roast''' or '''roast dinner''' is a [[British cuisine|British dish]] traditionally eaten on Sunday. It consists of [[Roasting|roast]] meat, [[Potato#Uses|roast or mashed potatoes]], and accompaniments such as [[Yorkshire pudding]], [[gravy]] and [[stuffing]], and may include condiments such as [[apple sauce]], [[mint sauce]], [[redcurrant sauce]], [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]], [[cranberry sauce]] or [[Horseradish|horseradish sauce]]. A range of vegetables can be served, such as [[broccoli]], [[Brussels sprout]]s, [[cabbage]], [[carrot]]s, [[cauliflower]], [[parsnip]]s or [[pea]]s, which can be boiled, steamed or roasted alongside the meat and potatoes. 

The Sunday roast's prominence in [[British culture]] is such that in a poll of Britons in 2012 it was ranked second in a list of things people love about Britain.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://swnsdigital.com/uk/2012/02/bacon-butty-best-of-british/|title=Bacon Butty Best of British|newspaper=SWNS digital|date=3 February 2012|access-date=27 April 2020}}{{Dead link|date=February 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Other names for this meal include '''Sunday lunch''', '''Sunday dinner''', '''roast dinner''' and '''full roast'''. The meal is often described as a less grand version of a traditional [[Christmas dinner]].

Besides being served in its original homeland, the tradition of a Sunday roast lunch or dinner has been a major influence on food cultures in the [[English-speaking world]], particularly in Australia, Ireland, Canada, South Africa, and New Zealand. A South African Sunday roast normally comprises roast pork, beef, lamb or chicken, roast potatoes or [[mashed potato]], and various vegetables such as [[cauliflower cheese]], [[creamed spinach]], [[Green bean|green beans]], carrots, peas, [[beetroot]] and [[sweet potato]]. It is also fairly common to serve rice and gravy or pap and tomato gravy in South Africa instead of Yorkshire pudding.

==Origin==
The Sunday roast originated in [[Great Britain|Britain]], particularly [[Yorkshire]], as a meal to be eaten after the [[church service]] on [[Lord's Day|Sunday]].<ref name=Hill2007/> Eating a large meal following church services is common to most of Europe, but the Sunday roast variant developed as unique to Britain. On Sundays all types of meat and dairy produce are allowed to be eaten; this is unlike Fridays, where many Christians of the [[Roman Catholic]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] and [[Methodism|Methodist]] denominations traditionally [[Friday Fast|abstain from eating meats]] and instead eat fish.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Foley|first=Michael P.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XstmMVLDzIIC&pg=PA29|title=Why Do Catholics Eat Fish on Friday?: The Catholic Origin to Just About Everything|date=2005-11-29|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-4039-6967-5|language=en|access-date=26 September 2020|archive-date=16 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210816075402/https://books.google.com/books?id=XstmMVLDzIIC&pg=PA29|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="Wesley1825">{{cite book |first=John  |last=Wesley |author-link=John Wesley |title=[[The Sunday Service of the Methodists]] |date=1825 |publisher=J. Kershaw |page=145 |language=English |quote=''Days of Fasting or Abstinence'' All the Fridays in the Year, except Christmas-Day}}</ref> Likewise, it is traditional for Anglicans and English Catholics [[Eucharistic discipline|to fast before Sunday services]], with a larger meal to break the fast afterwards. These Christian religious rules created several traditional dishes in the United Kingdom.
* Only eating fish on Friday resulted in a British tradition of 'fish Fridays', which is still common in [[fish and chip]] shops and restaurants across the United Kingdom on Fridays; particularly during [[Lent]].
* To mark the end of not being able to eat meat, the Sunday roast was created as a mark of celebration.

There are two historical points on the origins of the modern Sunday roast. 

* In the late 1700s, during the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the United Kingdom, families would place a cut of meat into the oven as they got ready for church. They would then add in vegetables such as potatoes, turnips and parsnips before going to church on a Sunday morning. When they returned from the church, the dinner was all but ready. The juices from the meat and vegetables were used to make a stock or gravy to pour on top of the dinner.<ref name=Hill2007>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/aug/19/britishidentity.lifeandhealth | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Amelia | last=Hill | title=How Friday saved the Sunday roast | date=19 August 2007|access-date=30 January 2011}}</ref>
* The second opinion holds that the Sunday roast dates back to [[medieval]] times, when the village [[serf]]s served the [[squire]] for six days a week. Then, on the Sunday, after the morning church service, serfs would assemble in a field and practise their battle techniques and were rewarded with a feast of oxen roasted on a spit.{{Citation needed|date=October 2024}}

==Typical elements==

===Meat===

Typical meats used for a Sunday roast are [[Chicken as food|chicken]], [[lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[pork]] or [[roast beef]], although seasonally [[Duck (food)|duck]], [[Goose as food|goose]], [[Gammon (meat)|gammon]], [[Turkey (food)|turkey]] or (rarely) other [[game bird]]s may be used.<ref>[http://www.ivillage.co.uk/food/tools/recipefinder/display_recipe/0,,4102,00.html Classic Roast Dinner<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212231744/http://www.ivillage.co.uk/food/tools/recipefinder/display_recipe/0,,4102,00.html |date=12 February 2010 }}</ref>

===Vegetables===
Sunday roasts can be served with a range of boiled, steamed and/or roast vegetables. The vegetables served vary seasonally and regionally, but will usually include [[Potato#Uses|roast potatoes]], roasted in meat [[dripping]] or [[vegetable oil]], and also [[gravy]] made from juices released by the roasting meat, perhaps supplemented by one or more [[Bouillon cube|stock cubes]], [[Bisto|gravy browning/thickening]], [[roux]] or [[Cornstarch|cornflour]].

The potatoes can be cooked around the meat itself, absorbing the juices and fat directly (as in a traditional Cornish under-roast).<ref name="Persey1993">{{cite book|first=Amanda |last=Persey|title=Favourite Cornish Recipes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=odwqAAAACAAJ|year=1993|publisher=J. Salmon|isbn=978-0-906198-97-1}}</ref> However, many cooks prefer to cook the potatoes and the Yorkshire pudding in a hotter oven than that used for the joint and so remove the meat beforehand to rest and "settle" in a warm place.<ref name="Smith1992">{{cite book|first=Delia |last=Smith|title=Delia Smith's complete cookery course|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YLKTQQAACAAJ|year=1992|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-36249-4}}</ref>

Other vegetables served with roast dinner can include mashed [[Rutabaga|swede]] or [[turnips]], roast [[parsnips]], boiled or steamed [[cabbage]], [[broccoli]], [[green bean]]s, and boiled [[carrot]]s and [[pea]]s. It is also not uncommon for vegetable dishes such as [[cauliflower cheese]] and stewed [[red cabbage]] to be served alongside the more usual assortment of plainly-cooked seasonal vegetables.

===Accompaniments===
Common traditional accompaniments include:

* ''[[Roast beef|beef]]'': [[Yorkshire pudding]], [[suet]] pudding; English [[Mustard (condiment)#English mustard|mustard]], [[gravy]] or [[horseradish sauce]]. Roast beef with Yorkshire pudding accompanied by "roast potatoes, vegetables, and horseradish sauce" is considered by ''[[National Geographic]]'' as the national dish of England.<ref>{{cite web|date=2011-09-13|title=Top 10 National Dishes -- National Geographic|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/top-10/national-food-dishes/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014060413/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/top-10/national-food-dishes/|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 October 2016|access-date=2020-08-08|website=Travel|language=en}}</ref>
* ''[[pork]]'': [[Pork rind#United Kingdom|crackling]] and [[Salvia officinalis|sage]]-and-onion [[stuffing]]; [[apple sauce]] or [[English mustard]].
* ''[[Lamb and mutton|lamb]]'': [[mint sauce]] or [[redcurrant sauce|redcurrant jelly]].
