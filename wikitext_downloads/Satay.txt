'''Satay'''{{efn|{{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɑː|t|eɪ}} {{respell|SAH|tay}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|t|eɪ}} {{respell|SA|tay}}, in the US also {{IPAc-en|s|ɑː|'|t|eɪ|audio=en-us-satay-2.ogg}} {{respell|sah|TAY}} or {{IPAc-en|s|æ|'|t|eɪ|audio=en-us-satay.ogg}} {{respell|sa|TAY}}}} or '''sate''' is a [[Southeast Asia|Southeast Asian dish]] consisting of small pieces of [[Seasoning|seasoned]] meat, seafood or vegetables [[Skewer|skewered on sticks]] and [[Grilling|grill]]ed over charcoal. It is typically served with a sauce, most commonly peanut-based and accompanied by rice cakes, cucumber or pickled vegetables. Common ingredients include chicken, beef, goat, pork and seafood, while regional and vegetarian variations are also found.

The dish evolved through a blend of foreign and local [[Fusion cuisine|culinary influences]]. [[Middle East]]ern [[kebab]]s introduced by Muslim traders, South Asian cooking techniques brought by [[Tamils|Tamil]] and [[Gujarati people|Gujarati merchants]], and [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese practices]] such as bamboo skewering and bite-sized portions were adapted in the port cities of [[Java]], [[Sumatra]] and the [[Malay Peninsula]]. Combined with the use of regional ingredients and spices including lemongrass, turmeric, galangal, and peanuts, these influences gave rise to a distinctly Southeast Asian style of grilled skewered meat.

Satay is widely consumed across [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Brunei]], [[Thailand]] and the [[southern Philippines]], where it forms part of everyday meals, street food and festive occasions. Regional adaptations reflect local ingredients and cooking traditions, incorporating elements such as [[sweet soy sauce]], coconut milk, turmeric and spice pastes, often served with [[ketupat]], [[lontong]] or [[acar|pickled condiments]]. The dish is prepared by hawkers, restaurants and home cooks alike, and has become a familiar feature of [[pasar malam|night markets]] and public celebrations.

Through [[Human migration|migration]] and [[Cultural diplomacy|cultural exchange]], satay has gained international recognition, with notable adaptations in the [[Netherlands]], [[Suriname]], [[South Africa]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. It is regarded as a [[national dish]] in Indonesia and Malaysia and remains a prominent element of hawker and [[Street food|street-food culture]] in Singapore, Thailand and Brunei. The dish is also maintained within overseas communities such as the [[Indo people|Indo-Dutch]] in the Netherlands, the [[Sri Lankan Malays]] and the [[Javanese Surinamese]], where it continues to represent a link to their Southeast Asian culinary heritage.

== Etymology ==
According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]<ref name="oed2">{{cite web|title=satay, n.|url=https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/171162|work=Oxford English Dictionary|access-date=19 January 2020|archive-date=7 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200607034145/https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/171162|url-status=live}}</ref> and the [[Collins English Dictionary]],<ref name="Definition of 'satay'">{{Cite web|title=Definition of 'satay'|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/satay|access-date=6 October 2025}}</ref> the English word satay derives from the [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Satai, Santapan Lezat yang Diakui Dunia |url=https://indonesia.go.id/kategori/pariwisata/268/satai-santapan-lezat-yang-diakui-dunia?lang=1 |website=indonesia.go.id |access-date=22 October 2025 |language=id}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Satai |url=https://kbbi.web.id/satai |website=kbbi.web.id |access-date=22 October 2025 |language=id}}</ref> word ''satai'', also taken from ''saté'' or ''sate'' (ꦱꦠꦺ) in [[Javanese language|Javanese]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Sate |url=https://kbji.kemendikdasmen.go.id/terjemahan/pados?Terjemahan%5Bcari%5D=sate |website=kemendikdasmen.go.id |access-date=22 October 2025 |language=jv}}</ref> and is ultimately traced to the [[Tamil language|Tamil word]] ''catai'' (சதை), a regional variant of ''tacai'' meaning "flesh".<ref name="oed2"/> The [[Cambridge English Dictionary]] defines satay more generally as a Southeast Asian dish of small pieces of meat or fish cooked on skewers and typically served with a spicy [[peanut sauce]].<ref name="Meaning of satay in English">{{Cite web|title=Meaning of satay in English|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/satay|access-date=6 October 2025}}</ref> Alternative explanations for the word’s origin include a possible derivation from the [[Hokkien]] or [[Southern Min|Min Nan phrase]] ''sa tae bak'' (三疊肉), meaning "three pieces of meat".<ref name="【深夜食堂】沙嗲、沙茶與Kebab：中東烤肉的散播史">{{Cite web|title=【深夜食堂】沙嗲、沙茶與Kebab：中東烤肉的散播史|language=Chinese|url=https://storystudio.tw/article/gushi/sata-sateh-kebab|access-date=19 October 2025}}</ref>

==History==
===Inspiration from foreign food traditions===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Studioportret van een verkoper van saté met zijn pikolan en klanten TMnr 60027242.jpg|thumb|Studio portrait of a satay vendor with his ''pikulan'' ([[shoulder pole]]) and customers, circa 1870 in [[Java]]. Collection of the [[Wereldmuseum Amsterdam|Tropenmuseum]], [[Netherlands]].]]
The culinary technique underlying satay is widely regarded as the result of multiple streams of [[Fusion cuisine|foreign influence]] that reached [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] through long-distance [[trade]] and [[Human migration|migration]]. The skewered and grilled meat dishes of the Middle East, particularly [[Turkish people|Turkish]] and [[Arabs|Arab]] kebabs, spread eastward along established [[Trade route|trade routes]]. Muslim merchants introduced these practices to [[South Asia]], where they were adapted into local culinary traditions. Tamil and Gujarati Muslim traders, who were active in the [[Indian Ocean trade|Indian Ocean trading networks]], prepared seasoned and grilled meats that bore similarities to kebabs, and these foodways accompanied them when they established communities in Southeast Asian port cities.<ref name="Singapore Infopedia - Satay">{{Cite web|title=Singapore Infopedia - Satay|url=https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=fb9c1ebd-90ee-4216-8cd8-004f68186e24|access-date=4 October 2025}}</ref><ref name="Sejarah Sate yang Mendunia: Dari India, Tiongkok, atau Asli Indonesia?">{{Cite web|title=Sejarah Sate yang Mendunia: Dari India, Tiongkok, atau Asli Indonesia?|language=Indonesian|url=https://nationalgeographic.grid.id/read/133825378/sejarah-sate-yang-mendunia-dari-india-tiongkok-atau-asli-indonesia?page=all|access-date=15 August 2025}}</ref>

[[Overseas Chinese|Chinese migrants]] also contributed to the evolution of the dish. Their culinary techniques emphasised the use of [[bamboo|bamboo skewers]] and the preparation of meat in small, bite-sized portions suited to quick grilling over charcoal fires. These methods complemented South Asian and Middle Eastern influences, resulting in a hybrid style of preparation that was well suited to the demands of street vending and communal dining in the region.<ref name="Sejarah Sate yang Mendunia: Dari India, Tiongkok, atau Asli Indonesia?"/>

===Emergence in Maritime Southeast Asia===
[[File:Preparing The Feast.jpg|thumb|Preparation of satay before the [[Perang pandan|Perang Pandan]] (Pandan War) festival in [[Tenganan|Tenganan village]], [[Karangasem Regency|Karangasem]], [[Bali]].]]
By the [[early modern period]], the combined influences of Middle Eastern, South Asian and Chinese food traditions had taken root in the [[Malay Archipelago|Malay archipelago]] and surrounding regions. [[Java]], [[Sumatra]] and the [[Malay Peninsula]] were central nodes of [[maritime trade]], attracting Muslim merchants from Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and the Arabian Peninsula, alongside large communities of Chinese migrants. In these [[Multiculturalism|multicultural port towns]], local populations were exposed to diverse methods of [[cooking|preparing]] and seasoning meat.<ref name="Penang Story Lectures">{{Cite web|title=Penang Story Lectures|url=https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=fb9c1ebd-90ee-4216-8cd8-004f68186e24|access-date=4 October 2025}}</ref><ref name="Past and present practices of the Malay food heritage and culture in Malaysia">{{Cite web|title=Past and present practices of the Malay food heritage and culture in Malaysia|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352618117301737|access-date=4 October 2025}}</ref><ref name="Tamil Muslims – The Chulias in the Malay World">{{Cite web|title=Tamil Muslims – The Chulias in the Malay World|url=http://drjrajamohamad.com/tamil-muslims-the-chulias-in-the-malay-world/|access-date=4 October 2025}}</ref>

The introduction of satay, and other now-iconic dishes such as {{lang|id|[[tongseng]]}} and {{lang|id|[[gulai]] kambing}} based on meats such as goat and lamb, coincided with an influx of [[Indian Indonesian|Indian]] and [[Arab Indonesian|Arab]] traders and immigrants starting in the 18th century.<ref name="CNN-Tongseng2">{{cite news |author=Christina Andhika Setyanti |date=30 August 2016 |title=Sepotong Sejarah Autentik Indonesia dalam Semangkuk Tongseng |language=id |publisher=CNN |url=http://www.cnnindonesia.com/gaya-hidup/20160830160605-262-154892/sepotong-sejarah-autentik-indonesia-dalam-semangkuk-tongseng/ |access-date=31 August 2016 |archive-date=31 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160831152810/http://www.cnnindonesia.com/gaya-hidup/20160830160605-262-154892/sepotong-sejarah-autentik-indonesia-dalam-semangkuk-tongseng/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The Indonesian publication ''[[Koran Jakarta]]'' claimed that ''sate'', and ultimately satay, originated from Javanese term ''sak beteng'' which means one stick, and that the dish had existed as early as the 15th century.<ref name="Koran">{{cite news |date=25 September 2019 |title=Beda Daerah, Beda Sajian Sate |language=id |work=[[Koran Jakarta]] |url=https://koran-jakarta.com/beda-daerah--beda-sajian-sate |access-date=24 March 2021 |archive-date=26 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190926220541/http://www.koran-jakarta.com/beda-daerah--beda-sajian-sate/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

It was within this environment that satay began to take on a distinctive Southeast Asian identity. Local cooks adapted foreign grilling practices to available resources, using [[Skewer|bamboo skewers]] and [[Coconut|coconut shell]] charcoal, and incorporating regional spices such as [[lemongrass]], [[turmeric]], [[coriander]] and [[galangal]]. [[Peanut]]s, introduced from the [[Americas]] via the [[Manila galleon|Manila galleon trade]], provided the basis for the [[peanut sauce]] that became one of satay’s most recognisable accompaniments.<ref name="The Manila Galleon: the globalization brought by the Spaniards">{{Cite web|title=The Manila Galleon: the globalization brought by the Spaniards|url=https://webhispania.info/the-manila-galleon-the-globalization-brought-by-the-spaniards/|access-date=4 October 2025}}</ref><ref name="The Manila Galleon and ‘the other silk route’">{{Cite web|title=The Manila Galleon and ‘the other silk route’|url=https://fddi.fudan.edu.cn/_upload/article/files/a6/f6/2ce2edb64b38be2f57f95f57792e/40871ebb-6063-447d-b8ad-76609f9473c2.pdf|access-date=4 October 2025}}</ref>

The dish soon spread beyond port cities into inland regions, where it became embedded in the food cultures of [[Javanese cuisine|Javanese]], [[Malay cuisine|Malay]] and other ethnic groups. By the 19th century, satay was already being recorded by colonial observers as a popular street food and festival dish, reflecting its role as both a culinary innovation of global exchanges and a locally embedded [[tradition]].<ref name="Satay History and Recipe: The Origins and Cooking Methods">{{Cite web|title=Satay History and Recipe: The Origins and Cooking Methods|url=https://www.arcanepast.com/2025/09/11/satay-history-and-recipe-the-origins-and-cooking-methods/|access-date=4 October 2025}}</ref>

===Regional diversification===

As satay spread throughout [[Maritime Southeast Asia]], it underwent a process of [[Indigenization|localisation]] that reflected the diverse cultural and ecological settings of the region. The basic technique of [[Grilling|grill]]ing skewered meat over [[charcoal]] was retained, but local communities adapted the dish according to their own culinary traditions, preferred proteins and seasoning styles.<ref name="Satay History and Recipe: The Origins and Cooking Methods">{{Cite web|title=Satay History and Recipe: The Origins and Cooking Methods|url=https://www.arcanepast.com/2025/09/11/satay-history-and-recipe-the-origins-and-cooking-methods/|access-date=4 October 2025}}</ref>
[[File:Sate Ponorogo.jpg|thumb|''Sate Ponorogo'', chicken satay with peanut sauce and sweet soy sauce, is believed among Indonesian as earliest satay dish in Java, created by first regent of [[Ponorogo Regency]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chandrasari |first1=Fenty |title=Ini Asal Usul Sate, Makanan Populer Indonesia yang Mendunia |url=https://rri.co.id/mataram/kuliner/1312727/ini-asal-usul-sate-makanan-populer-indonesia-yang-mendunia |website=rri.co.id |access-date=22 October 2025 |language=id}}</ref> ]]
In Indonesia, the dish developed into a wide variety of regional forms. In Java, chicken (''sate ayam'') and goat (''[[sate kambing]]'') became popular, often marinated in [[sweet soy sauce]] and served with [[peanut sauce]] or sliced [[shallot]]s, and the two famous ones are ''sate Madura'' and ''sate Ponorogo'' from [[East Java]].  [[Central Java]] and [[Yogyakarta]] are also known for ''sate klathak'', made from skewered mutton seasoned simply with salt and grilled over open charcoal. In [[Bali]], ''sate lilit'' features minced meat mixed with grated coconut and spices, wrapped around bamboo sticks or lemongrass stalks. In Sumatra, [[Padang cuisine|Minangkabau cooks]] developed ''sate Padang'', characterised by its thick, spicy [[turmeric]]-based sauce, while [[Aceh]]'s ''sate matang'' offered their own variants satay with broth. Other distinctive Indonesian examples include ''sate kelinci'' ([[rabbit]] satay) from mountainous regions, ''sate kerang'' ([[Cockle (bivalve)|cockle]] satay) from coastal areas and ''sate buntel'' (minced lamb wrapped in [[caul]] fat) from [[Surakarta]].<ref name="A peek at Indonesia's 40+ ways with satay">{{Cite web|title=A peek at Indonesia's 40+ ways with satay|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/food/article/a-peek-at-indonesias-40-ways-with-satay/q8er44p9n|access-date=4 October 2025}}</ref>

[[File:CHICKEN SATAY.jpg|thumb|[[Malaysian cuisine|Malaysian chicken satay]] served with peanut sauce, a popular local variation of the dish.]]
On the [[Malay Peninsula]], [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay communities]] embraced satay as part of their food heritage. Common local variations included beef, chicken, and tripe, usually served with a peanut-based sauce, [[ketupat]] (compressed rice cakes) and raw onions or cucumber. Other distinctive versions made use of meats such as rabbit, venison and even [[porcupine]]. On the east coast, lokching (also known as ''sate ikan'' or fish satay) forms an important element of local identity. In [[Sabah]], the arrival of [[Cocos Malays|Cocos Malay]] migrants contributed sate Cocos to the state’s culinary repertoire.<ref name="From Java's Street Vendors to Southeast Asian Icon: The Story of Sate or Satay">{{Cite web|title=From Java's Street Vendors to Southeast Asian Icon: The Story of Sate or Satay|url=https://seasia.co/2023/07/12/from-javas-street-vendors-to-southeast-asian-icon-the-story-of-sate-or-satay|access-date=4 October 2025}}</ref>

[[File:Khlong Chak Phra, Taling Chan, Bangkok, Thailand - panoramio (11).jpg|thumb|left|A vendor selling satay from a boat at [[Khlong Chak Phra]], [[Taling Chan district|Taling Chan]], [[Bangkok]], Thailand]]
In [[Thailand]], satay is believed to have been introduced through [[Thai Malays|Malay–Muslim communities]] in the [[Southern Thailand|southern provinces]], where it continues to be part of local food traditions. The dish subsequently spread northwards, including to [[Bangkok]], where it was adapted with [[Thai cuisine|Thai-style marinades]] and condiments. Some sources suggest that its introduction to [[central Thailand]] may also have occurred via Singapore. While chicken and beef are more typical in the Muslim-majority south, [[pork]] satay became particularly widespread in mainstream Thai cuisine. It is now a common element of Thai street food, usually served with peanut sauce and pickled cucumber relish.<ref name="Southern Thai Cuisine">{{Cite web|title=Southern Thai Cuisine|url=https://www.templeofthai.com/cooking/southern-cuisine.php|access-date=4 October 2025}}</ref><ref name="The Origins of Satay and its Evolution in Thailand">{{Cite web|title=The Origins of Satay and its Evolution in Thailand|url=https://www.koktailmagazine.com/2024/05/01/origins-evolution-satay/|access-date=4 October 2025}}</ref>

In [[Singapore]], satay became a hallmark of [[Hawker centre|hawker culture]], shaped by Malay, Javanese and [[Hainan cuisine|Hainanese influences]], and was sold at venues such as the historic Satay Club. In the [[Mindanao|southern Philippines]], [[bangsamoro|Muslim Filipino communities]] developed a related dish known as ''satti'', thought to have been derived from satay and typically served with a spicy sauce and [[rice cake]]s. Other Filipino skewered meat dishes, such as [[Chicken inasal|inasal]] or barbecue, show parallels with satay through the shared practice of charcoal grilling, though they developed distinctive seasonings shaped by local tastes.<ref name="From Java's Street Vendors to Southeast Asian Icon: The Story of Sate or Satay"/>

Satay thus became established in multiple food cultures across [[Southeast Asia]], with each region creating its own distinctive versions. Despite differences in choice of meat, marinades and condiments, the dish remained recognisable by its characteristic method of grilling skewered portions of meat over charcoal.<ref name="From Java's Street Vendors to Southeast Asian Icon: The Story of Sate or Satay"/><ref name="Satay History and Recipe: The Origins and Cooking Methods"/><ref name="A peek at Indonesia's 40+ ways with satay"/>

===Colonial-era dispersal and diaspora===
[[File:Sosaties.jpg|thumb|[[Sosatie|South African sosaties]], a [[Cape Malays|Cape Malay dish]] influenced by satay, made with marinated meat grilled on skewers.]]
During the colonial era satay travelled beyond Maritime Southeast Asia through several overlapping channels: [[Indentured servitude|indentured labour]] recruitment, [[penal colony|penal]] and military transfers, merchant networks and later migration of colonial-era administrators and their families. The movement was not a single event but a series of flows from the late 18th century through the first half of the 20th century that carried both people and culinary practices to new social and ecological settings.<ref name="Sosaties Cape Malay Kebabs"/>

[[Javanese people|Javanese labourers]] introduced satay to [[Suriname]], where it became a hallmark of [[Javanese Surinamese|Javanese-Surinamese cuisine]] and later integrated into the broader national food culture.<ref name="The History of the Tasty Satay Meat Skewers"/> In the [[Netherlands]], returning colonial officials, [[Indo people|Indo-Dutch families]] and post-war migrants brought the dish into domestic cooking and restaurant traditions, where sate became a central feature of the [[rijsttafel]] and remains a popular staple of [[Dutch cuisine]]. 

In [[South Africa]], Malay settlers at the Cape developed sosatie, a marinated and skewered meat dish influenced by satay, which became a distinctive part of [[Cape Malays|Cape Malay]] and broader [[South African cuisine|South African cooking]].<ref name="Sosaties Cape Malay Kebabs"/><ref name="Cape Malay Curried Lamb and Apricot Sosaties"/> In [[Sri Lanka]], [[Sri Lankan Malays|Malay communities]] who arrived through colonial-era military and administrative transfers preserved the dish within their own culinary traditions, where it is known as satay and served at communal and festive occasions.

===Modern globalisation===
[[File:Satay in Singapore Airlines.jpg|thumb|left|Satay served as an [[Hors d'oeuvre|appetiser]] on [[Singapore Airlines]]]]
During the colonial era, satay was documented by [[Dutch colonial empire|Dutch]] and [[British Empire|British]] observers as a popular food across the [[Indonesian archipelago]] and the [[Malay Peninsula]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=“Mrs Beeton” in Malaya: Women, Cookbooks and the Makings of the Housewife|url=https://biblioasia.nlb.gov.sg/vol-9/issue-3/oct-dec-2013/beeton-women-cookbooks-housewives/|access-date=5 October 2025}}</ref> By the 19th century, street vendors in Java, Malay Peninsula, Singapore and Siam were noted for selling skewered meats grilled over portable charcoal braziers.<ref name="Grill">{{cite book | title = Mastering the Grill: The Owner's Manual for Outdoor Cooking | author1 = David Joachim | author2 = Andrew Schloss | publisher = Chronicle Books | year = 2010 | isbn = 9780811878357 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hM3PEXmSqhIC&q=Indonesian+satay+sauce+Thai&pg=PA116 | page = 116 | access-date = 9 June 2020 | archive-date = 13 June 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200613145804/https://books.google.com/books?id=hM3PEXmSqhIC&pg=PA116&dq=Indonesian+satay+sauce+Thai | url-status = live }}</ref> In [[British Malaya]], satay was commonly associated with Malay night markets, festive occasions, and roadside stalls, while in the [[Dutch East Indies]] it was reported as a widespread urban street food.

In the decades that followed, satay became embedded in the culinary life of [[multi-ethnic]] [[Port|port cities]]. In Singapore, it was widely sold by hawkers and became a popular evening street food, later concentrated in venues such as the [[Satay Club]].<ref name="The history of Satay">{{Cite web|title=The history of Satay|url=https://www.bunzlasiapacific.com/the-history-of-satay/|access-date=5 October 2025}}</ref> In Malaysia, towns such as Kajang emerged as centres of satay production and consumption, while in Indonesia the dish remained closely tied to local markets and festive gatherings.

[[File:2016 0427 Factory-made satay babi Netherlands.jpg|thumb|[[frozen food|Factory-produced]] ''satay babi'' (pork satay) in the [[Netherlands]]]]
From the mid-20th century onwards, satay gained wider recognition as migration and diaspora communities introduced it abroad. Indonesian, Malaysian, Singaporean and Thai emigrants established restaurants across Asia, Europe, Australia and North America, while adaptations in the Philippines reflected parallel culinary exchanges. International food festivals, cookbooks and diplomatic events further promoted satay as a signature Southeast Asian dish.<ref name="From Satay to Shawarma: When Soft Power Tastes Really, Really Good">{{Cite web|title=From Satay to Shawarma: When Soft Power Tastes Really, Really Good|url=https://www.gulfaseanexchange.com/article/from-satay-to-shawarma-when-soft-power-tastes-really-really-good|access-date=5 October 2025}}</ref>

Today, satay is regarded as a national dish in both Indonesia and Malaysia,<ref name="Resipi Nenek-Moyang DiLupa Jangan">{{Cite web|title=Resipi Nenek-Moyang DiLupa Jangan|language=Malay|url=https://www.bernama.com/bm/news.php?id=1708929|access-date=5 October 2025}}</ref> while in Singapore it is closely tied to hawker culture. In 2011, it was listed by the [[Ministry of Tourism (Indonesia)|Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy]] of Indonesia as one of the country’s national foods; in Malaysia, it is likewise recognised as a national heritage food by the Department of National Heritage; and in 2020, it was included in Singapore’s [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|UNESCO]] inscription of hawker culture on the Representative List of the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]]. These recognitions reflect satay’s dual role as a shared regional tradition and a marker of national heritage across Southeast Asia.<ref name="Singapore’s iconic, but endangered, street food now has UNESCO status">{{Cite web|title=Singapore’s iconic, but endangered, street food now has UNESCO status|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/why-unesco-is-honoring-singapore-street-food|access-date=5 October 2025}}</ref>

Chicken is the most common meat used in satay,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Delicious Satay, Indonesia's Most Famous Dish! - Indonesia Travel |url=https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/trip-ideas/delicious-satay-indonesia-s-most-famous-dish |access-date=2022-11-30 |website=www.indonesia.travel |language=en}}</ref> with other common choices including lamb, goat, mutton, beef, [[venison]], and rabbit; seafood such as fish, [[Shrimp (food)|shrimp]], and [[Squid as food|squid]]; [[offal]] such as [[Liver (food)|liver]], intestine, and [[tripe]], is also used. Most satay is made by cutting the meat into small thumb-size cubes, however, such recipes as Ponorogo use a single finger-like chicken fillet. 

The skewers used for chicken satay are traditionally made from ''lidi'', a midrib of coconut fronds. Bamboo skewers might be used instead. For firmer meats, such as lamb, goat, and beef, a thicker bamboo skewer is used. The skewers are usually soaked in water before using to avoid burning during grilling. Each skewer usually holds three or four pieces of meat. A goat meat satay might insert a cube of fat between meat cubes. [[Turmeric]] gives the dish its characteristic yellow colour. Another popular marinade is ''[[kecap manis]]'' (sweet soy sauce) mixed with coconut oil or palm [[margarine]]. The skewered meat is seasoned, marinated, and then grilled on [[charcoal]] [[ember]]s.

Satay may be served with a [[Spice|spicy]] [[peanut sauce]] dip, or peanut gravy, served with slices of ''[[lontong]]'' or ''[[ketupat]]'' (rice cakes), garnished with a sprinkle of ''[[bawang goreng]]'' (crisp fried shallot), and accompanied by ''[[acar]]'' (pickles) consisting of slivers of onions, carrots, and [[cucumber]]s in vinegar, salt, and sugar solution. Mutton satay is usually served with kecap manis instead of peanut sauce. Pork satay can be served in a [[pineapple]]-based satay sauce or cucumber [[relish]].

Among the most widespread styles is chicken-based satay (''sate ayam''), which is found throughout the country and typically paired with peanut sauce and rice cakes such as [[lontong]] or [[ketupat]] and also well-known as ''sate Madura'', often characterised by sweet soy and peanut condiments also ''sate Ponorogo'', prepared from thinly sliced marinated chicken, while [[Central Java]]’s ''sate Ambal'' is distinctive for its [[tempeh]]-based sauce. Other recognisable variants include ''sate Banjar'' from [[South Kalimantan]], ''sate Blora'' from Central Java, and more recently, [[Jakarta]] popularised ''sate taichan'', a minimalist style that omits peanuts and soy in favour of [[sambal]] and lime.<ref name="A peek at Indonesia's 40+ ways with satay"/>

Indonesia has developed one of the widest ranges of satay varieties, influenced by local ingredients, cultural practices and regional tastes. While chicken, beef and goat are the most common, numerous versions using seafood, [[offal]] and vegetarian ingredients are also found. Satay is prepared domestically, served in restaurants and sold by vendors in settings ranging from roadside [[warung]] and temporary stalls to travelling hawkers and [[Online food ordering|online delivery services]]. Traditional selling methods include the ''pikulan'' ([[Carrying pole|shoulder pole]]), ''sunggi'' ([[tray]] balanced on the head) and ''gerobak'' (wheeled cart) associated with [[madura|Madurese vendors]].<ref name="Kompas-id Sate1">{{Cite web|date=2021-11-10|title=Di Sini Sate, Di Sana Sate|url=https://interaktif.kompas.id/baca/di-sini-sate-di-sana-sate/|access-date=2021-11-11|website=Kompas.id Tutur Visual|language=id}}</ref>

*'''''Pikulan''''': In Indonesian, ''pikulan'' means carrying items by balancing a rod on one's shoulder. The most traditional way of selling satay was depicted in early photographs of Java in the late 19th century, showing the travelling satay vendor using this ''pikulan'' which resembles two small wooden cabinets carried with a rod made of either bamboo, wood, or rattan.
*'''''Sunggi''''': In Javanese, ''sunggi'' means carrying things upon one's head using some kind of tray or platter. This practice is quite common in today's Bali and rural Java. The ''sunggi'' satay vendors—usually women—carry raw satays, lontongs, peanut sauce upon the wooden or wicker bamboo tray on their head, while carrying basket containing grill, charcoal, bamboo fan, sweet soy sauce bottle, and wooden small short chair called ''dingklik''. The satay seller ladies may walk through residential areas or position their wares in busy areas (e.g. marketplace or [[Tourist attraction|tourism area]]), and grill the satay to their customer's order.
*'''''Gerobak''''': In Indonesian, ''gerobak'' means wheeled cart. It is one of the common method of selling satay by travelling vendors. The Madura satay vendor cart usually has unique boat-like shape ''gerobak'' [[food cart]].
*'''''Warung''''': In Indonesian, ''[[warung]]'' means modest shop, selling foods or other things. The most common satay ''warung'' usually are ''warung tenda'', modest tarp-tent shop stationed in busy street side to await customers.
*'''Online satay''': In recent years with the advent of digital multi-service method that includes food delivery such as [[Gojek|GoFood]] and [[Grab (company)|GrabFood]], satay is available by ordering online, and the food immediately delivered by [[motorcycle taxi]] called ''ojek''.

===Malaysia===
[[File:Satay hawker.jpg|thumb|A satay hawker grilling skewers at a food stall in Malaysia.]]
Known locally as sate in [[Malay language|Malay]] (pronounced similarly to the English "satay"), the dish is widely available throughout Malaysia, both in restaurants and from [[Hawker (trade)|hawkers]] in [[food court]]s and [[pasar malam]] ([[Night market|night markets]]). Beef and chicken are the most common types, often served with [[peanut sauce]], compressed rice cakes ([[ketupat]]), cucumber and onions. While sate is strongly associated with [[malayness|Malay Muslim]] food traditions, pork satay is also prepared in non-[[halal]] Chinese establishments.

[[Kajang]], a town in Selangor, has become particularly well known for its satay. The term ''sate Kajang'' refers to a style distinguished by larger chunks of meat and the accompaniment of peanut sauce with a side of fried chilli paste.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Khoo |first1=Ethel |last2=Chan |first2=E. Jacqui |date=2019 |title=Kajang: More Growth Ahead |url=http://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/kajang-more-growth-ahead |access-date=2022-12-22 |website=The Edge Markets}}</ref>  Its popularity has led to the spread of Kajang-style satay across Malaysia. Stalls and restaurants in Kajang and beyond also offer a wide range of alternatives, including venison, rabbit, fish, gizzard, liver and other varieties.

[[File:Lok-lok-01.jpg|thumb|left|An array of lok-lok skewers, a [[Malaysian Chinese cuisine|Chinese–Malaysian variant]] of satay.]]
Other notable Malaysian adaptations include sate ''[[lok-lok]]'' from [[Penang]] and ''[[Satay celup|sate celup]]'' from [[Malacca]], both of which represent [[Malaysian Chinese cuisine|Malaysian Chinese fusions]] of satay with [[Hot pot|hotpot]] traditions. In these dishes, raw meats, seafood, vegetables, tofu, and offal are skewered on sticks and cooked by dipping them in boiling water, stock, or satay sauce. ''Sate lok-lok'' refers to skewers dipped in stock and eaten with sauce on the side, while ''sate celup'' describes skewers cooked directly in peanut sauce. These versions are usually sold by street vendors or in casual eateries, and are commonly non-halal.<ref name="Where to eat in Penang: Best Lok Lok in Penang, Malaysia">{{Cite web|title=Where to eat in Penang: Best Lok Lok in Penang, Malaysia|url=https://feastoftravel.com/where-to-eat-in-penang-best-lok-lok-in-penang-malaysia/|access-date=5 October 2025}}</ref><ref name="Steamboat Satay (Satay celup)">{{Cite web|title=Steamboat Satay (Satay celup)|url=https://www.tasteatlas.com/satay-celup|access-date=5 October 2025}}</ref>

Distinctive regional traditions also exist. On the east coast of [[Peninsular Malaysia]], especially in [[Kelantan]], [[Terengganu]] and coastal [[Pahang]], ''lokching'' (also known as ''sate ikan'' or fish satay) forms part of the local identity.<ref name="Resipi Lokching @ Sate Ikan Homemade.

In Singapore, satay is prepared and sold by [[Malay Singaporeans|Malay]], [[Chinese Singaporeans|Chinese]] and Indian Muslim vendors. It is generally thought to have originated in [[Java]] and was introduced to the island by Muslim traders.<ref name="Singapore Hawker Classics">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aEB2CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA88|title=Singapore Hawker Classics Unveiled: Decoding 25 Favourite Dishes|last=Polytechnic|first=Temasek|date=15 July 2015|publisher=Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd|isbn=9789814677868|language=en|access-date=19 August 2019|archive-date=18 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200818215300/https://books.google.com/books?id=aEB2CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA88|url-status=live}}</ref> By the 1940s, satay had become one of the most popular street foods in Singapore, often consumed at festive occasions. Traditionally sold from roadside stalls and pushcarts, concerns over hygiene and urban redevelopment in the 1950s led to the centralisation of vendors at [[Beach Road, Singapore|Beach Road]], in a cluster later known as the "Satay Club". The stalls were relocated in the 1960s to Esplanade Park, where they became a fixture in tourist guides until their eventual removal in the late 1990s to make way for the Esplanade, Theatres on the Bay.

[[File:LauPaSat Satay.JPG|thumb|left|[[Singaporean cuisine|Singapore-style satay]] served at the Satay Club in Lau Pa Sat, Singapore.]]
The concept of satay dining established by the Satay Club, open air, communal and available primarily at night, remains influential in [[Culture of Singapore|Singapore’s food culture]]. While the name was transferred to [[Clarke Quay]] after the closure of the Esplanade site, other satay centres emerged, such as the stalls at [[Lau Pa Sat]] and the establishment of "Satay Street" on [[Boon Tat Street]] in 1996, where hawkers serve satay after 7 pm when the road is closed to traffic. These venues are often seen as evoking the atmosphere of mid twentieth century street dining. Contemporary adaptations include Satay by the Bay, located at [[Gardens by the Bay]], which explicitly models itself on the old Satay Club.<ref name="Satay Club">{{cite news|url= https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/singapore-satay-street-food/index.html|title= In Singapore, an entire street dedicated to satay|author= Dominica Lim|date= July 25, 2017|work= CNN Travel|location=Atlanta|publisher=[[Warner Bros.

Singaporean satay is usually served with peanut sauce, but regional and cultural differences are reflected in its variations. [[Malay cuisine|Malay satay]] resembles [[Javanese cuisine|Javanese]] versions and is often marinated with [[Sweet soy sauce|kecap manis]], while [[Hainan people|Chinese Hainanese]] satay is distinct for its use of [[pineapple]] purée sauce and [[Five-spice powder|five spice]] seasoning.<ref name="Singapore Hawker Classics"/>  Common varieties include chicken (satay ayam), beef (satay lembu), mutton (satay kambing), as well as beef intestine (satay perut) and beef tripe (satay babat). Beyond street and hawker settings, satay has also been incorporated into national branding, with [[Singapore Airlines]] serving satay as an appetiser in its [[First class travel|First]] and [[Business class|Business Class]] cabins.

Despite the native origins of inasal and inihaw, the English association of "barbecue" is the source of names for other popular street foods that are also served skewered, such as [[banana cue]] ("banana" + "barbecue") and [[camote cue]] ("''[[camote]]'' (sweet potato) + barbecue").<ref name="skewer_stick">[http://www.overseaspinoycooking.net/2007/09/banana-que.html?showComment=1275289857770 Overseas Pinoy Cooking.Net] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303212805/http://www.overseaspinoycooking.net/2007/09/banana-que.html?showComment=1275289857770 |date=3 March 2016 }} website.

Offal-based versions of inihaw are also commonly sold in the Philippines as street food. The most popular are made from chicken or pork intestines known as ''[[isaw]]''. Other variants use liver, [[tripe]], lungs, chicken heads and feet, [[Pig blood curd|cubes of coagulated pork blood]], and pork ears, among others.<ref>{{cite web|title=Isaw ng Manok (Grilled Chicken Intestine)|url=http://panlasangpinoy.com/2009/02/26/isaw-ng-manok-chicken-intestines/|website=Panlasang Pinoy|date=27 February 2009 |access-date=6 September 2016|archive-date=16 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916084017/http://panlasangpinoy.com/2009/02/26/isaw-ng-manok-chicken-intestines/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Isaw and other Pinoy Street Barbecue|url=http://www.angsarap.net/2014/03/07/isaw-and-other-pinoy-street-barbecue/|website=Ang Sarap|date=7 March 2014 |access-date=6 September 2016|archive-date=12 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412112954/http://www.angsarap.net/2014/03/07/isaw-and-other-pinoy-street-barbecue/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Netherlands===
[[File:Kipsate met friet.jpg|thumb|right|Chicken satay in the Netherlands with [[peanut sauce]], [[French fries]], [[Prawn cracker|prawn crackers]] and mayonnaise; as served in [[Amsterdam]]]]
Known as ''saté'' or ''sateh'', it is fully adapted in [[Dutch cuisine|Dutch everyday cuisine]]. Owing to their shared colonial history, satay is an Indonesian food that has become an integral part of Dutch cuisine.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.expatica.com/nl/lifestyle/food-drink/best-dutch-foods-with-recipes-108631/|title=Top 10 Dutch foods – with recipes|access-date=27 June 2022}}</ref> Pork and chicken satays are almost solely served with spicy peanut sauce and called ''een sateetje'', and are readily available in snackbars and supermarkets.<ref>[[Frommer's]] Irreverent Guide to Amsterdam, 2004, p 66</ref> Versions with goat-meat (''sateh kambing'') and sweet soy sauce are available in Indonesian restaurants and take-aways. Pork or chicken satay in peanut sauce, with salad and French-fries, is popular in pubs or ''eetcafés''. With Indonesian take-away meals like ''nasi goreng speciaal'', the special part is often a couple of sate-sticks. 

Another favourite in Dutch snackbars is the ''satékroket'', a [[croquette]] made with a peanut sauce and shredded meat [[ragout]]. In addition, 'saté' sauce or peanut sauce has become one of the standard options as a condiment to accompany a portion of fries bought in a snackbar (besides [[mayonnaise]], [[ketchup]], [[Curry ketchup|curry-ketchup]], '[[joppiesaus]]' or a combination). Fries with satay sauce is commonly known as ''patatje pinda'' ('fries peanut') and fries with satay sauce, mayonaise and chopped unions is called ''patatje oorlog'' ('fries war').

===South Africa===
[[File:Chicken sosatie.jpg|thumb|Chicken [[sosatie]], a [[South African cuisine|South African skewered dish]] of [[Cape Malays|Cape Malay]] origin.]]
In South Africa, a well-known variation of ''satay'' is [[sosatie]], a [[Cape Malays|Cape Malay dish]] consisting of marinated meat, traditionally lamb or mutton, skewered and grilled over a braai (barbecue). The name combines ''sate'' (skewered meat) with ''saus'' ([[sauce]]), reflecting its [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] [[Native Indonesians|Indonesian]] influence brought through Cape Malay cuisine. Unlike Southeast Asian satay, sosaties are typically marinated overnight in a mixture that may include onions, chillies, garlic, curry leaves and tamarind juice, and are often interspersed with ingredients such as dried apricots, peppers or onions, giving the dish a distinctive sweet savoury profile.<ref name="Sosaties Cape Malay Kebabs">{{Cite web|title=Sosaties Cape Malay Kebabs|url=https://www.marissa.co/sosaties/|access-date=5 October 2025}}</ref><ref name="Cape Malay Curried Lamb and Apricot Sosaties">{{Cite web|title=Cape Malay Curried Lamb and Apricot Sosaties|url=https://britishlarder.co.uk/cape-malay-curried-lamb-and-apricot-sosaties/|access-date=5 October 2025}}</ref>

===Suriname===
Satay is also popular in Suriname, where it was introduced by [[Javanese Surinamese|Javanese migrants]] during the colonial period. Brought by contract workers from the [[Dutch East Indies]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the dish became a part of [[Culture of Suriname|Surinamese cuisine]] and is commonly known as sate. It is widely sold by street vendors and in restaurants, often served with peanut sauce, slices of white bread, lontong (rice cakes), or fried rice. Variants include chicken, beef, and goat satay, reflecting both [[Javanese cuisine|Javanese culinary traditions]] and local adaptations. Through the [[Surinamese people|Surinamese diaspora]], particularly in the Netherlands, satay has also become a familiar component of [[Indo people|Dutch-Indonesian]] cuisine.<ref name="The History of the Tasty Satay Meat Skewers">{{Cite web|title=The History of the Tasty Satay Meat Skewers|url=https://www.grapesandgrains.org/2017/08/the-history-of-tasty-satay-meat-skewers.html|access-date=5 October 2025}}</ref>

===Sri Lanka===
In Sri Lanka, satay was introduced by [[Sri Lankan Malays|Malay communities]] who migrated to the island during the [[Dutch Ceylon|Dutch]] and [[British Ceylon|British colonial periods]].<ref name="‘Disailankan’: Malay Consciousness in Sri Lanka">{{Cite web|title=‘Disailankan’: Malay Consciousness in Sri Lanka|url=https://apakhabartv.com/2024/09/11/disailankan-malay-consciousness-in-sri-lanka/|access-date=5 October 2025}}</ref> Known locally as sate or satay, it is usually made with chicken or beef, marinated in spices such as turmeric, coriander, and garlic, and grilled over charcoal or open flames. It is commonly served with peanut sauce, sambal, or other condiments.<ref name="Authentic Sri Lankan Malay food on parade at Cinnamon Grand">{{Cite web|title=Authentic Sri Lankan Malay food on parade at Cinnamon Grand|url=https://www.themorning.lk/articles/InbvRpRgQyJE6uPubhvp|access-date=5 October 2025}}</ref>

Satay is an important part of Sri Lankan Malay culture, served at religious festivals, weddings, and other communal gatherings.<ref name="Authentic Sri Lankan Malay food on parade at Cinnamon Grand"/> Over time, it has also become popular in urban areas like [[Colombo]], appearing in street food stalls and restaurants and enjoyed by a wider audience beyond the Malay community.

===Fusion satay===
[[File:McDonald's Burger Sate Indonesia 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[McDonald's]] ''burger sate'' (satay burger) in Indonesia, which is beef burger served with peanut sauce]]
Traditionally, satay referred to any grilled skewered meats with various sauces; it is not necessarily served solely with peanut sauce. However, since the most popular variant of satay is chicken satay in peanut sauce (''Sate Madura'' in Indonesia), in modern [[fusion cuisine]] the term "satay" has shifted to satay style peanut sauce instead.<ref name="USAPea">{{cite web|title=Consumers love succulent Satay, Peanut ingredients for global success|url=http://uk.peanutsusa.com/PDF-Library/Peanut-Ingredients/Satay-trade-information-paper-for-distribution.pdf|publisher=USA Peanuts|page=1|access-date=2 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502163243/http://uk.peanutsusa.com/PDF-Library/Peanut-Ingredients/Satay-trade-information-paper-for-distribution.pdf|archive-date=2 May 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

For example, the fusion "satay burger" refers to [[Hamburger|beef hamburger]] served with so-called "satay sauce", which is mainly a kind of sweet and spicy peanut sauce or often replaced with gloppy [[peanut butter]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Peanut Satay Burgers |url=http://www.cheese-burger.net/recipes/peanut-satay-burgers.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110731001154/http://www.cheese-burger.net/recipes/peanut-satay-burgers.html |archive-date=31 July 2011 |access-date=28 July 2011 |website=cheese-burger.net}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=NewsLifeMedia |title=Satay Chicken Burgers Recipe |url=http://www.taste.com.au/recipes/7375/satay+chicken+burgers |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505182213/http://www.taste.com.au/recipes/7375/satay+chicken+burgers |archive-date=5 May 2015 |access-date=15 January 2015}}</ref> The Singapore [[satay bee hoon]] is actually rice vermicelli served in peanut sauce.

Satay belongs to the informal ethnocultural symbols of Indonesia. Its appears on Indonesian postage stamps, in tourist brochures, information and advertising materials dedicated to this country, and is often played up by Indonesian participants in various cultural and entertainment events held abroad to create a national flavor. For example, the Indonesian model Aurra Kharisma performed in 2021 at the [[Miss Grand International]] beauty pageant in a suit with satay images and a headdress decorated with several bundles of satay meat skewers.<ref name="Kompas-Aurra">{{cite web|url=https://regional.kompas.com/read/2021/03/28/060700078/asal-usul-sate-ayam-madura-yang-jadi-simbol-pemersatu?page=all|title=Asal-usul Sate Ayam Madura yang Jadi Simbol Pemersatu|author=Rachmawati|publisher=Kompas|date=2021-03-28|access-date=2021-10-14|language=id}}</ref><ref name="Aurra">{{cite web|url=https://www.kapanlagi.com/foto/berita-foto/indonesia/86665aurra_kharisma-20210325-002-non_fotografer_kly.html|title=7 Potret Cantik Aurra Kharisma Pakai Busana Bertema Sate di Miss Grand Internasional 2020, Karya Anak Bangsa Bikin Bangga|author=|publisher=Etnis|date=2021-03-21|access-date=2021-10-14|language=id}}</ref><ref name="Kompas-7 Fakta">{{cite web|url=https://www.kompas.com/food/read/2021/08/17/131100975/7-fakta-sate-makanan-yang-dipesan-soekarno-usai-proklamasi-kemerdekaan?page=all|title=7 Fakta Sate, Makanan yang Dipesan Soekarno Usai Proklamasi Kemerdekaan|author=Krisda Tiofani|date=2021-08-17|access-date=2021-10-15|language=id}}</ref>

In some parts of Indonesia, certain types of satay are attributed with different symbolic meanings. Especially [[Bali]] stands out: the popular on this island ''[[sate lilit]]''—minced sausages stuck on [[lemongrass]] stalks—is considered there a symbol of several virtues and benefits at once: male prowess, unity and prosperity.<ref name="Etnis">{{cite web|url=https://etnis.id/simbol-persatuan-dalam-sate-lilit-masyarakat-bali/|title=Simbol Persatuan dalam Sate Lilit Masyarakat Bali|author=I Komang Kusuma Adi|publisher=Etnis|date=8 January 2020|accessdate=2021-10-14|language=id}}</ref> The Balinese attribute the embodiment of the weapons of various [[Hindu deities]] and mythological heroes to other local types of satay.<ref name="Kompas-Senjata">{{cite web|url=https://travel.kompas.com/read/2013/05/09/16170662/~Travel~Food%20Story|title=Sate dan Senjata Para Dewa|author=I Made Asdhiana|publisher=Kompas|date=2013-05-09|accessdate=2021-10-14|language=id}}</ref>

In [[Bandung]], the [[West Java]] Governor's office is popularly called [[Gedung Sate]] ({{langx|id|Satay building}}) to refer the satay-like pinnacle on its roof.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Museum Gedung Sate |url=https://www.travelfish.org/sight_profile/indonesia/java/west_java/bandung/4083 |access-date=2022-04-27 |website=Travelfish |language=en}}</ref>
