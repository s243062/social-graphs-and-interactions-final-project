Bosanski lonac has been on the tables of both the rich and the poor for hundreds of years. The wealthy prepared the dish with more meat and other expensive ingredients, while the poor used what was available. Typical ingredients are [[beef]], [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[cabbage]], [[potato]]es, [[tomato]]es, [[carrot]]s, [[parsley]], [[garlic]], and [[black pepper|peppercorns]] (whole, not ground). Many different vegetables or meats may be used. Bosanski lonac is prepared by layering meat and vegetables (alternating layers of meat and vegetables until the pot is full) into a deep [[cooking pot|pot]], then adding 1-2 dl water. The ingredients are usually cut into large pieces rather than finely chopped or minced.

Originally, Bosanski lonac was made in ceramic pots<ref name="IBP-1"/> and cooked in a fireplace or pit in the ground. Today, with the declining availability of fireplaces for cooking, many cooks use a regular pot and a kitchen stove.
