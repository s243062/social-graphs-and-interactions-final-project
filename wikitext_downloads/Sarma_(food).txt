'''Stuffed leaves'''&mdash;more commonly known by its sub-types ''stuffed grape leaves'', '' stuffed vine leaves'', or ''stuffed cabbage leaves''&mdash;are a food made of leaves rolled around a filling of [[Ground meat|minced meat]], [[grain]]s such as [[rice]], or both. It is occasionally known in the English-speaking world by its Turkish name, '''''sarma''''', which (as a [[Ottoman cuisine|dish of the Ottoman Empire]]) is also used in [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and some Eastern European languages. Since the [[Dissolution of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Empire's dissolution]], its popularity persists for instance in [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], [[persian cuisine|Persian]], [[Greek cuisine|Greek]], [[Romanian cuisine|Romanian]], [[Levantine cuisine|Levantine]], [[Arab cuisine|Arabic]], and [[Armenian cuisine|Armenian cuisines]]. 

Wrapped leaf dishes are part of the broader category of stuffed dishes known as ''[[dolma]]'', and they have equivalents (such as the Polish ''[[gołąbki]]'') in Eastern European cuisines from the northern Baltic through Romania. The type of leaves used commonly includes [[Cabbage roll|cabbage]], [[Rumex patientia|patience dock]], [[Collard (plant)|collard]], [[vine leaves|grapevine]], [[kale]], or [[chard]] leaves.

==Background==
A grapevine leaf roll is a dish consisting of cooked grapevine leaves wrapped around a variety of fillings. 

Vine leaves may also be used to wrap stuffed celery root. Before wrapping, the celery root is stuffed with rice that has been seasoned with cinnamon, salt, pepper, allspice, pine nuts, and sugar (this type of rice is called ''iç pilav''). Dried fruits like fig and apricot may be added to the rice mixture before the celery root is stuffed, wrapped, and baked in the oven.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Zeytinyağlı, Kuru Meyveli Kereviz Dolması| work = Sabah| access-date = 2018-06-30| url = https://www.sabah.com.tr/sofra/tarifler/zeytinyaglilar-ve-mezeler/zeytinyagli-kuru-meyveli-kereviz-dolmasi}}</ref> Some variations may include [[quince]].<ref>{{Cite AV media| people = Nursel'in Evi| title = Ayvalı Kereviz Dolması Tarifi| access-date = 2018-06-30| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gvv80r05NU}}</ref>

=== Bulgaria ===
[[File:Дроб сарма.jpg|thumb|Drob sarma]]

In [[Bulgaria]], besides the two main rolled varieties—cabbage sarma (usually eaten in winter) and grape leaf sarma (in spring and summer)—there is also a layered variety called drob sarma (''дроб сарма'', literally 'liver sarma'). Drob sarma is a dish of finely chopped offal (liver and lung), rice, browned onions, herbs, baked in an oven, and after a while covered with a mixture of eggs and yogurt and baked again.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.thespruceeats.com/bulgarian-drob-sarma-recipe-1135767 |title=Bulgarian Drob Sarma |access-date=2021-10-31 |archive-date=2021-10-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211031143447/https://www.thespruceeats.com/bulgarian-drob-sarma-recipe-1135767 |url-status=live }}</ref> The dish may be covered or even wrapped in [[caul fat]] before being baked. All sarma dishes can be served with fresh yogurt on the side.

===Croatia===
In Croatia sarma is common throughout the country though there are regional variations. Sarma is typically a meat dish filled with a combination of beef, pork, and rice, wrapped in sauerkraut leaves. In some regions, fresh cabbage is used. Sinjski arambašići, from [[Sinj]], are made from ground beef wrapped in sauerkraut leaf, with no grains or pork. Sarma is a winter staple and is also traditionally served on New Year's Eve.<ref>{{cite web|title=5 important facts you need to know about Croatian sarma|url=https://www.https/|access-date=2023-03-13|archive-date=2013-08-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819141428/http://https/|url-status=dead}}</ref> In Croatia, sarma are eaten with mashed potatoes, bread, corn bread, or sour cream.

=== Greece ===
In [[Greece]], the dish is now known as ''dolmades''. In [[ancient Greece]], fresh tender fig leaves called "thrion" were used instead of grape leaves to create the dish. In some parts of Greece today, fig leaves are still used. Nowadays, the fillings vary, like they probably did in ancient times as well. Rice is the most common filling today, which was unavailable in the region in ancient times. It has been conjectured that another type of grain, such as [[spelt]], might have been used instead.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ricotti |first=Eugenia Salza Prina |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iJWhUOazBvsC&pg=PA51 |title=Meals and Recipes from Ancient Greece |date=2007 |publisher=Getty Publications |isbn=978-0-89236-876-1 |pages=51 |language=en}}</ref>

===Crimean Tatars (Crimea, Ukraine)===
In the cuisine of the Crimean Tatars there is a dish called "sarma", which is prepared from grape leaves. The name of the dish means 'wrapped in'. The stuffing consists of minced beef or lamb, rice, chopped onion, salt, and ground pepper. Sometimes tomato paste, some greens, carrots, and other spices can be added to the filling.
Due to the influence of Ukrainian cuisine (holubtsi), sarma is also sometimes prepared from cabbage leaves. Dolma for Crimean Tatars is stuffed pepper; the filling for dolma is the same as for sarma.<ref>{{Citation |title=Qırımtatar yemekleri: Cарма | date=6 December 2022 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GesQNaP4ZdU |access-date=2023-07-18 |language=en}}</ref>
