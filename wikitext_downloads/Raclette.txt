Raclette is historically a dish originating from the [[canton of Valais]] in Switzerland. This cheese from Valais benefits from an [[Appellation d'origine protégée (Switzerland)|AOP]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Raclette and cheese experiences {{!}} Valais Switzerland |url=https://www.valais.ch/en/activities/gastronomy-local-products/raclette-du-valais-aop |access-date=2022-11-18 |website=www.valais.ch}}</ref> [[Raclette cheese]] is also a [[Swiss-type cheese]] marketed specifically to be used for this dish.

Raclette is also served as [[street food]], but often with bread instead of potatoes.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.escape.com.au/destinations/europe/gluhwein-to-raclette-the-best-christmas-markets-in-europe/news-story/0559121e2ddad82a462e0d633e261ab5 | title=Gluhwein to raclette: The best Christmas markets in Europe | publisher=Escape.com.au | date=22 December 2022 | accessdate=19 February 2023 | author=Maguire, Mercedes |quote= If you try nothing else, don’t miss the raclette cheese stall, where they heat huge half wedges of cheese under an open fire and scrape the melted cheese onto a crunchy baguette roll and top it with bacon.}}</ref>

==History==

[[File:Trauffer Raclette-Gondel Firstbahn Grindelwald.jpg|thumb|Raclette is a dish associated with Alpine culture (here served in a [[gondola lift]] in [[Grindelwald]]).]]
Dishes of melted cheese were mentioned in medieval texts from Swiss [[convent]]s as early as 1291.<ref name=Ch>{{cite web|title=La raclette|url=https://www.raclette-suisse.ch/fr/main/produits-conseils/petite-histoire.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203052955/http://www.raclette-suisse.ch/fr/main/produits-conseils/petite-histoire.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-12-03|work=Raclette-suisse.ch}}</ref> Melted cheese was originally consumed by peasants in the mountainous Alpine regions of the cantons of [[Canton of Valais|Valais]] and [[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]] (Switzerland), and [[Savoie]] and [[Haute-Savoie]] (France). It was then known in the [[German-speaking Switzerland|German-speaking part of Switzerland]] as {{Lang|de|Bratchäs}} or {{Lang|de|Bratkäse}}, "roasted cheese". Traditionally, cow herders carried cheese with them when they were moving cows to or from pastures up in the mountains. In the evening, the cheese would be placed next to a [[campfire]] for softening, then scraped onto bread. Melting raclette-type cheese in front of a fire is attested in Valais since 1574. Since 1875, the French term ''raclette'' is commonly used for this dish. At the 1909 Cantonal Exhibition of Sion, raclette was promoted as a national dish of Valais. Raclette eventually gained national (and international) popularity from the [[Expo 64|1964 National Exhibition]].<ref name=CHS>{{cite web | url=https://www.patrimoineculinaire.ch/Produits?text=raclette&canton=&categorie=#444 | language=French | title=Raclette du Valais (AOP) | work=[[Culinary Heritage of Switzerland]] | accessdate=16 January 2023 |quote=Le fait de fondre le fromage devant un feu est également attesté dès 1574 en Valais, de manière particulièrement détaillée, dans un document rédigé par Gaspard Ambuel, dit Collinus, médecin et pharmacien à Sion.

In Valais, raclette is typically served with potatoes, [[Pickled gherkins|cornichons]] (fermented, pickled cucumbers), pickled onions, black tea, other warm beverages, or [[Chasselas|Fendant]] wine. A popular French option is to serve it with white wine, such as [[Vin de Savoie AOC|Savoy wine]], but [[Riesling]] and [[pinot gris]] are also common. Traditionally, it is consumed with black tea, since a warm beverage is considered to improve digestion.<ref>{{cite web |title=Zurich study settles longstanding fondue beverage debate |url=https://www.dw.com/en/zurich-study-settles-longstanding-fondue-beverage-debate/a-14731202 |website=dw.com |access-date=30 June 2020}}</ref>

==Dish==
Raclette is a dish native to parts of Switzerland. The raclette cheese round is heated, either in front of a fire or by a special machine, then scraped onto diners' plates.<ref name="texasoven">{{cite web |title=Raclette – another classic for cooking with fire |url=http://texasovenco.com/raclette/ |website=Texas Oven Co. |date=2 March 2017 |access-date=23 October 2019}}</ref>

Traditionally the melting happens in front of an open fire, with the big piece of cheese facing the heat. One then regularly scrapes off the melting side. Some restaurants that serve raclette use a heat lamp to substitute for the open fire, with the cheese being put under the lamp as the customer orders and the melted cheese scraped off, as in the traditional method. The melted cheese is accompanied by small firm [[potato]]es (Bintje, Charlotte or Raclette varieties), cornichons ([[gherkin]]s), [[pickling|pickled]] [[onion]]s, and dried meat, such as [[prosciutto|jambon cru/cuit]], [[salami]], and ''[[Bindenfleisch|viande des Grisons]]'', and to drink, [[kirsch]], black or herbal tea or white wine from a Valais vineyard (a Fendant wine from the [[Chasselas]] grape).{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

A modern way of serving raclette involves an electric table-top grill with small pans, known as ''coupelles'', in which slices of raclette cheese are melted.<ref name=CHS/> This new way has been used since the 1950s. Generally the grill is surmounted by a hot plate or griddle. In Switzerland the electrical raclette is called "raclonette". The device is put in the middle of the table. The cheese is brought to the table sliced, accompanied by platters of boiled or steamed potatoes, other vegetables, and [[charcuterie]] (various meats). These are then mixed with potatoes and topped with cheese in the small wedge-shaped coupelles that are placed under the grill to melt and brown the cheese. Alternatively, slices of cheese may be melted and simply poured over food on the plate. The emphasis in raclette dining is on relaxed and sociable eating and drinking, the meal often running to several hours. French and other European supermarkets generally stock both the grill apparatus and ready-sliced cheese and charcuterie selections, especially around Christmas. Restaurants also provide raclette evenings for parties or dinners.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}
