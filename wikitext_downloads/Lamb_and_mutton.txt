'''Lamb and mutton''', collectively '''sheep meat''' (or sheepmeat) is one of the most common meats around the world, taken [[meat]] from the [[Sheep|domestic sheep]], ''Ovis aries'', and generally divided into '''lamb''', from sheep in their first year, '''hogget''', from sheep in their second, and '''mutton''', from older sheep.

In [[South Asian cuisine|South Asian]] and [[Caribbean cuisine|Caribbean]] cuisine, "mutton" often means [[goat meat]].<ref name="oed">''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 3rd edition, June 2003, [https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/124371 ''s.v.'', definition 1b</ref><ref name=HT>{{cite news|title=Whose goat is it anyway?|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/brunch-stories/whose-goat-is-it-anyway/article1-809563.aspx|access-date=15 May 2015|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=11 February 2012|archive-date=25 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181225054153/https://www.hindustantimes.com/brunch/whose-goat-is-it-anyway/story-iUTujy9czvoPPMoUKrTtqI.html|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>Charmaine O'Brien, ''The Penguin Food Guide to India'', section "The Commons", under "Mutton", {{isbn|9780143414568}}</ref><ref>Madhur Jaffrey, ''An Invitation to Indian Cooking'', {{isbn|0375712119}}, p. 49</ref><ref>Janet Groene, Gordon Groene, ''U.S. Caribbean Guide'', 1998, {{isbn|1883323878}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=vh3eancwP-YC&q=goat%20mutton p. 81]</ref> At various times and places, "mutton" or "goat mutton" has occasionally been used to mean goat meat.<ref name="oed"/>

Lamb is the most expensive of the three types, and in recent decades, sheep meat has increasingly only been retailed as "lamb", sometimes stretching the accepted distinctions given above. The stronger-tasting mutton is now hard to find in many areas, despite the efforts of the [[Mutton Renaissance Campaign]] in the UK. In Australia, the term '''prime lamb''' is often used to refer to lambs raised for meat.<ref>[http://www.abare.gov.au/publications_html/livestock/livestock_00/lamb.pdf Australian Prime Lamb Industry, 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413052016/http://www.abare.gov.au/publications_html/livestock/livestock_00/lamb.pdf |date=13 April 2011 }}</ref> Other languages, such as [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[Italian language|Italian]], make similar or even more detailed distinctions among sheep meats by age and sometimes by sex and diet—for example, ''[[lechazo]]'' in Spanish refers to meat from milk-fed (unweaned) lambs.

== Classifications and nomenclature ==
[[File:Lamb chops 2014-03-06 12-39.jpg|thumb|[[Meat chop|Lamb chops]] with [[new potatoes]] and green beans]]
The definitions for lamb, hogget and mutton vary considerably between countries. Younger lambs are smaller and tenderer. Mutton is meat from a sheep over two years old, and has tougher flesh. In general, the darker the colour, the older the animal.

=== Britain, Australia, and New Zealand ===
;Lamb: A young sheep which is less than one year old. From 1 July 2019, the Australian definition is "an ovine animal that: (a) is under 12 months of age, or (b) does not have any permanent [[Incisor|incisor teeth]] in wear". This new definition meant that Australian farmers could extend the term "lamb" by another month.<ref name=SPA>[http://sheepproducers.com.au/lamb-definition/ "Australia's New Definition of Lamb – What You Need to Know"]{{Dead link|date=July 2025 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (4 July 2019). ''SheepProducers.com.au''. Retrieved 28 September 2019.</ref> This followed a similar definition change in New Zealand in 2018. In Britain the definition is still "0 permanent incisor teeth". A permanent incisor tooth is said to be "in wear" if it protrudes further than the nearest [[Deciduous teeth|milk teeth]].<ref name=SPA/>
;Hogget: A sheep of either sex having no more than two permanent incisors in wear.<ref name="MD">Delbridge, Arthur, "The Macquarie Dictionary", 2nd ed., Macquarie Library, North Ryde, 1991</ref> The term is also used to refer to meat from the aforementioned animal. In the UK, it means animals that are 11 to 24 months old, while Australian butchers use the term for animals that are 13 to 24 months old.<ref>[https://www.farmison.com/community/blog/difference-lamb-hogget-mutton What is the difference between lamb, hogget & mutton?] Farmison & Co (British online butcher).

Retrieved 27 August 2022.</ref> Still common in farming usage and among speciality butchers, it is now a rare term in British, Australian and New Zealand supermarkets, where meat of all sheep less than two years old tends to be called "lamb".
;Mutton: The meat of a female (ewe) or castrated male (wether) sheep having more than two permanent incisors in wear.

In [[Romanesco dialect]], the offspring of the sheep who is still suckling or recently weaned is called ''[[abbacchio]]'', while the offspring of the sheep almost a year old who has already been shorn twice is called ''agnello'' ({{literally|lamb}}).<ref name="romaincampagna">{{cite web|url=https://www.romaincampagna.it/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/impara-abbacchio.pdf|title=Osservatorio sulla spesa di Roma|access-date=8 January 2024|language=it}}</ref> This distinction exists only in the Romanesco dialect.<ref name="romaincampagna"/> ''Abbacchio'' is consumed throughout [[central Italy]] as an [[Easter in Italy|Easter]] and [[Christmas in Italy|Christmas]] dish.<ref name="abbacchioromanoigp-prodotto">{{cite web|url=http://www.abbacchioromanoigp.it/Il_prodotto_tp5_pg161.aspx|title=Abbacchio Romano IGP|publisher=abbacchioromanoigp.it|access-date=10 June 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714115702/http://www.abbacchioromanoigp.it/Il_prodotto_tp5_pg161.aspx|archive-date=14 July 2014}}</ref><ref name="Treccani">{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/vocabolario/abbacchio/|title=abbàcchio|publisher=Vocabolario – [[Treccani]]|access-date=15 January 2016}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web |date=19 July 2019|title=Abbacchio |url=https://www.lacucinaitaliana.com/glossary/abbacchio |access-date=1 November 2022|website=La Cucina Italiana |language=en-US}}</ref> It is a product protected by the [[European Union]] with the [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union#Protected geographical indication (PGI)|PGI]] mark.<ref name="PGI">{{cite web|url=https://www.qualigeo.eu/prodotto-qualigeo/abbacchio-romano-igp/|title=Abbacchio Romano IGP|publisher=qualigeo.eu|access-date=7 January 2024|language=it}}</ref>

Throughout [[central Italy]], including Sardinia, [[pastoralism]] was the main source of meat. Since ancient times, ''abbacchio'' has been one of the staple foods of the [[Lazio]] region, especially for rural communities, whose consumption at the table was considerable.<ref name="romaincampagna"/> The tradition of consuming ''abbacchio'' spread in ancient times where mainly adult [[sheep]] were slaughtered. The slaughter of ''abbacchio'' was forbidden except during the [[Easter in Italy|Easter]] and [[Christmas in Italy|Christmas]] periods, and until June. Over the centuries, given the importance of the food, around 100 recipes for preparing lamb have been developed in Lazio.<ref name="romaincampagna"/> Given the importance of ''abbacchio'' in social life, historical events dedicated to ''abbacchio'' are still organized in the Lazio region today, i.e. ''[[Sagra (festival)|sagre]]'', country festivals and popular events.<ref name="romaincampagna"/> In ancient times, sheep was eaten during work in the countryside, while ''abbacchio'' was consumed only during the Easter holidays.<ref name="romaincampagna"/>

=== South Asia ===
[[File:Mutton briyani from Little India, Singapore - 20130719.jpg|thumb|Indian-style [[mutton biryani]]]]
The term "mutton" is applied to [[goat meat]] in most countries of South Asia, and the goat population has been rising. For example, [[mutton curry]] is usually made from goat meat. It is estimated that over a third of the goat population is slaughtered every year and sold as mutton. The domestic sheep population in India and the Indian subcontinent has been in decline for over 40 years and has survived at marginal levels in mountainous regions, based on wild-sheep breeds, and mainly for [[wool]] production.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sheep (new, with animal welfare information) {{!}} Infonet Biovision Home. |url=https://infonet-biovision.org/AnimalHealth/Sheep |access-date=17 June 2022 |website=infonet-biovision.org |archive-date=4 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220704094226/https://infonet-biovision.org/AnimalHealth/Sheep |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Other types ===
[[File:Agnello spiedini.12.piatto.jpg|thumb|Lamb skewers with potatoes and tomatoes, Italy]]
;Suckling lamb or milk-fed lamb: Meat from an unweaned lamb, typically 4–6 weeks old and weighing 5.5–8&nbsp;kg; this is typically unavailable in the United States and the United Kingdom. The flavour and texture of milk-fed lamb when grilled (such as the small lamb cutlets known as ''[[Cuisine of Spain|chuletillas]]'' in Spain) or roasted (''[[Lechazo de Castilla y León|lechazo]] asado'' or ''cordero lechal asado'') is generally thought to be finer than that of older lamb, and fetches higher prices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.speleogroup.org/sg2012.html#20.06|title=Speleogroup – sg2012|work=speleogroup.org}}</ref> The areas in northern Spain where this can be found include [[Asturias]], [[Cantabria]], [[Castile and León]], and [[La Rioja (autonomous community)|La Rioja]]. <!-- In the United Kingdom, '''lamb''' generally implies older animals, slaughtered between 3 and 9 months. --> Milk-fed lambs are especially prized for [[Easter]] in Greece, when they are roasted on a spit.
;Young lamb: A milk-fed lamb between six and eight weeks old
;Spring lamb: A lamb, usually three to five months old, born in late winter or early spring and sold usually before 1 July (in the northern hemisphere).
;Sucker lambs: A term used in Australia<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sheepcrc.org.au/index.php?id=1353|title=Australian Sheep CRC|work=sheepcrc.org.au}}</ref> — includes young milk-fed lambs, as well as slightly older lambs up to about seven months of age which are also still dependent on their mothers for milk. Carcasses from these lambs usually weigh between 14 and 30&nbsp;kg. Older weaned lambs which have not yet matured to become mutton are known as old-season lambs.
;Yearling lamb: a young sheep between 12 and 24 months old
;Saltbush mutton: a term used in Australia for the meat of mature Merinos which have been allowed to graze on [[atriplex]] plants
;Salt marsh lamb: (Also known as 'saltmarsh lamb' or by its French name, ''[[agneau de pré-salé]]'') The meat of sheep which graze on [[salt marsh]] in coastal estuaries that are washed by the tides and support a range of salt-tolerant grasses and herbs, such as [[samphire]], sparta grass, [[sorrel]] and [[sea lavender]]. Depending on where the salt marsh is located, the nature of the plants may be subtly different. Salt marsh lamb has long been appreciated in France and is growing in popularity in the United Kingdom. Places where salt marsh lamb are reared in the UK include [[Harlech]] and the [[Gower Peninsula]] in Wales, the [[Somerset Levels]], [[Morecambe Bay]] and the [[Solway Firth]].<ref>Keating, Sheila."[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/food_and_drink/article4198041.ece Food Detective: Salt Marsh Lamb] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013155445/http://timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/food_and_drink/article4198041.ece |date=13 October 2008 }}."

The meat of a lamb is taken from the animal between one month and one year old, with a carcass weight of between {{convert|5.5|and|30|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This meat generally is more tender than that from older sheep and appears more often on tables in some [[Western countries]]. Hogget and mutton have a stronger flavour than lamb because they contain a higher concentration of species-characteristic fatty acids and are preferred by some.<ref>Fearnley-Whittingstall, Hugh. "[http://www.muttonrenaissance.org.uk/whatIsMutton.php What Is Mutton – Understanding the History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170723081313/http://www.muttonrenaissance.org.uk/whatIsMutton.php |date=23 July 2017 }}." ''Mutton Renaissance.''</ref> Mutton and hogget also tend to be tougher than lamb (because of connective [[tissue maturation]]) and are therefore better suited to [[casserole]]-style cooking, as in [[Lancashire hotpot]], for example.

Lamb is often sorted into three kinds of meat: [[wikt:forequarter|forequarter]], [[loin]], and [[wikt:hindquarter|hindquarter]]. The forequarter includes the neck, shoulder, front legs, and the ribs up to the shoulder blade. The hindquarter includes the rear legs and hip. The loin includes the ribs between the two.

[[meat chop|Lamb chops]] are cut from the rib, loin, and shoulder areas. The rib chops include a rib bone; the loin chops include only a [[vertebra|chine]] bone. Shoulder chops are usually considered inferior to loin chops; both kinds of chops are usually [[grilling|grilled]]. Breast of lamb (baby chops) can be cooked in an oven.

Leg of lamb is a whole leg; [[saddle]] of lamb is the two loins with the hip. Leg and saddle are usually [[roasting|roasted]], though the leg is sometimes [[boiling|boiled]].

Forequarter meat of sheep, as of other mammals, includes more connective tissue than some other [[Primal cuts|cuts]], and, if not from a young lamb, is best cooked slowly using either a moist method, such as [[braising]] or [[stewing]], or by slow roasting or [[barbecue|American barbecuing]]. It is, in some countries, sold already chopped or diced.

Mutton barbeque is a tradition in Western Kentucky. The area was strong in the wool trade, which gave them plenty of older sheep that needed to be put to use.<ref name=KentuckyBBQ>{{cite web|url=https://www.thespruce.com/owensboro-mutton-barbecue-331595|title=Owensboro Kentucky Mutton Barbecue}}</ref>

Meat from sheep features prominently in the cuisines of several [[Mediterranean cuisine|Mediterranean]] cultures including [[Greek cuisine|Greece]], [[Croatian cuisine|Croatia]], [[Turkish cuisine|Turkey]], [[Cuisine of Africa#North Africa|North Africa]], [[Jordan]], and the [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle East]], as well as in the cuisines of [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]]. In Greece, for example, it is an integral component of many meals and of religious feasts such as Easter, like ''[[avgolemono]]'' and ''[[magiritsa]]''. It is also popular in the [[Basque cuisine|Basque]] culture, both in the Basque country of Europe and in shepherding parts of the Western United States (where [[Basque Americans#Migration and sheepherding|shepherds of Basque descent]] have been active since the 1850s). In the United States, the [[Navajo]] have incorporated mutton and lamb into their traditional cuisine since the introduction of sheep by Spanish explorers and settlers in the 17th century, replacing wild turkey and venison and creating a pastoral culture. In [[Northern Europe]], mutton and lamb feature in many traditional dishes, including those of [[Cuisine of Iceland|Iceland]], [[Norwegian cuisine|Norway]] and the [[British cuisine|United Kingdom]].

Mutton is also popular in [[Cuisine of Australia|Australia]]. Lamb and mutton are very popular in [[Central Asian cuisine|Central Asia]] and in certain parts of [[Chinese cuisine|China]], where other red meats may be eschewed for religious or economic reasons. [[Barbecue]]d mutton is also a specialty in some areas of the United States (chiefly [[Owensboro, Kentucky]]) and Canada. However, meat from sheep is generally consumed far less in the US than in many European, Central American and Asian cuisines; for example, average per-capita consumption of lamb in the United States is only {{convert|400|g}} per year.<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/>

In [[Australia]], the leg of lamb roast is considered to be the [[national dish]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/roast-lamb-rules-as-australias-national-dish/story-e6frfkvr-1225825752497|title=Roast lamb rules as Australia's national dish|date=2 February 2010}}</ref> Commonly served on a Sunday or any other special occasion, it can be done in a kettle BBQ or a conventional oven. Typical preparation involves covering the leg of lamb with butter, pushing rosemary sprigs into incisions cut in the leg, and sprinkling rosemary leaves on top. The lamb is then roasted for two hours at {{convert|180|°C|°F|abbr=on|round=25}} and typically served with carrots and potato (also roasted), green vegetables and gravy.

In [[Indonesia]], lamb is popularly served as lamb [[satay]]<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r4yC_uDLnTQC&pg=PA185 |title=Indonesian Regional Food and Cookery By Sri Owen|isbn=9780711212732|access-date=7 July 2010|last1=Owen|first1=Sri|year=1999|publisher=Frances Lincoln }}</ref> and [[lamb curry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/food/recipes/lamb-curry-gulai-kambing|title=Lamb curry (gulai kambing)|author=Susilowati Primo|work=Food|date=21 March 2013}}</ref> Both dishes are cooked with various spices from the islands, and served with either rice or [[lontong]]. A version of lamb and [[bamboo shoot]] curry is the specialty of [[Padang cuisine|Minang]] cuisine, although similar dishes can be found in [[Thai cuisine]].

In [[Mexico]], lamb is the meat of choice for ''[[barbacoa]]'', in which the lamb is roasted or steamed wrapped in maguey leaves underground.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Steamed meat: Igbo translation, definition, meaning, synonyms, pronunciation, transcription, antonyms, examples |url=https://en.opentran.net/english-igbo/steamed+meat.html |access-date=17 June 2022 |website=en.opentran.net}}</ref>

In [[Japan]], although lamb is not traditionally consumed in most of the country, on the northern island of [[Hokkaido]] and in the northeastern [[Tohoku]] regions, a hot-pot dish called [[jingisukan]] (i.e. "Genghis Khan") is popular. In that dish, thin-sliced lamb is cooked over a convex skillet alongside various vegetables and mushrooms in front of the diners, then dipped in soy-sauce-based dipping sauces and eaten. It was so named because lamb is popular in Mongolia (see "Sheep meat consumption" above).

===Organ meats/offal ===

Lamb's [[liver (food)|liver]], known as [[lamb's fry]] in New Zealand and Australia,<ref>Delbridge, Arthur, The Macquarie Dictionary, 2nd ed., Macquarie Library, North Ryde, 1991</ref> is eaten in many countries. It is the most common form of [[offal]] eaten in the UK, traditionally used in the family favourite (and [[Pub#Food|pub grub]] staple) of liver with onions, potentially also with bacon and mashed potatoes. It is a major ingredient, along with the lungs and heart (the pluck), in the traditional Scottish dish of [[haggis]].

Lamb testicles or [[lamb fries]] are a [[delicacy]] in many parts of the world.
 
Lamb [[kidney]]s are found in many cuisines across Europe and the Middle East, often split into two halves and grilled (on [[kebab]]s in the Middle East), or sautéed in a sauce. They are generally the most highly regarded of all kidneys.

Lamb [[sweetbread]]s are a delicacy in many cuisines.<ref>*[https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/sweetbread Sweetbread recipes] BBC food
