==History==
[[File:Tart telur Portugis (Pastéis de nata) 20230409 194702.jpg|thumb|left|{{lang|pt|Pastel de nata}} (locally known as {{lang|zsm|tart telur Portugis}}) in Malaysia]]
{{lang|pt|Pastéis de nata}} tarts are pastries inspired by an original recipe called {{lang|pt|pastéis de Belém}}, which were created before the 18th century by Catholic monks at the [[Jerónimos Monastery]] in the [[freguesia|civil parish]] of [[Belém (Lisbon)|Saint Mary of Bethlehem]], in Lisbon.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://theculturetrip.com/europe/portugal/articles/a-brief-introduction-to-pastel-de-nata-portuguese-custard-tarts/ |title=A Brief Introduction to Pastel De Nata, Portuguese Custard Tarts |first=Nina |last=Santos |website=Culture Trip |date=26 February 2017 |access-date=2019-11-12 |archive-date=2020-06-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200611100454/https://theculturetrip.com/europe/portugal/articles/a-brief-introduction-to-pastel-de-nata-portuguese-custard-tarts/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> At the time, convents and monasteries used large quantities of egg-whites for [[Laundry starch|starching]] clothes, such as [[friar]]s and [[nun]]s' [[religious habit]]s. It was quite common for monasteries and [[convent]]s to use the leftover egg yolks to make cakes and pastries, resulting in the proliferation of sweet pastry recipes throughout the country.

In the aftermath of the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820]], following the dissolution of religious orders and in the face of the impending closure of many convents and monasteries, the monks started selling {{lang|pt|pastéis de nata|italics=no}} at a nearby sugar refinery to bring in revenue. In 1834, the monastery was closed and the recipe sold to the sugar refinery, whose owners opened the {{lang|pt|Fábrica de Pastéis de Belém|italics=yes}} in 1837. The descendants own the business to this day.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.cmjornal.pt/mais-cm/domingo/detalhe/175-anos-de-pasteis-de-belem |title=175 anos de pastéis de Belém [175 years of pasteléis de Belém] |date=12 August 2012 |work=[[Correio da Manhã (Portugal) |Correio da Manhã]] |access-date=2018-06-06 |language=pt |archive-date=2018-07-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703000608/https://www.cmjornal.pt/mais-cm/domingo/detalhe/175-anos-de-pasteis-de-belem |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Since the opening of {{lang|pt|Fábrica de Pastéis de Belém|italics=yes}}, the original recipe that inspired {{lang|pt|pastel de nata|italics=yes}} varieties is kept in a secret room. The {{lang|pt|Fábrica de Pastéis de Belém|italics=yes}} is, therefore, the only place in the world that produces the original pastry that inspired many variations commonly known as "{{lang|pt|pastéis de nata|italics=yes}}"; the shop is located just a short three-minute walk from the Jerónimos Monastery.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.golisbon.com/sight-seeing/jeronimos.html |title=Jeronimos Monastery, Lisbon |website=www.golisbon.com}}</ref> The shop offers both takeout and sit-in services and sells over 20,000 pastéis a day.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.lisbonguru.com/pasteis-belem-taste-history/ |title=Pastéis de Belém: A Taste of History |date=2016-05-27}}</ref> The tart is often sprinkled with ''canela'' ([[cinnamon]]).{{cn|date=October 2024}}

In 2009 ''[[The Guardian]]'' listed {{lang|pt|pastéis de Belém |italics=yes}} as one of the 50 "best things to eat" in the world.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/sep/13/best-foods-in-the-world |title=The 50 best things to eat in the world, and where to eat them (The Guardian) | location=London | first=Killian |last=Fox |date=13 September 2009}}</ref> In 2011, following the result of a public vote, the pastry was announced as one of Portugal's Seven Wonders of Gastronomy, further cementing it as one of the country's most popular national dishes.<ref>[https://wetravelportugal.com/pastel-de-nata-recipe/ Pastel de Nata] wetravelportugal.com.
