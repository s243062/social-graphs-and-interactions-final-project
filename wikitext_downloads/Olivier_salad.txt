'''Olivier salad''' ({{langx|ru|link=no|салат Оливье|salat Olivye}}, {{Pronunciation|LL-Q7737 (rus)-Svetlov Artem-Olivier salad.wav}}), also known as '''Russian salad'''{{sfn|Ayto|2013}}{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|p=39}} or '''Stolichny salad''',<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bayramli |first=Nigar |date=2 January 2020 |title=Here Are New Year’s Common Food Traditions In Caspian |url=https://caspiannews.com/news-detail/here-are-new-years-common-food-traditions-in-caspian-2019-12-31-10/ |access-date=20 September 2025 |website=Caspian News}}</ref> is a traditional [[salad]] dish in [[Russian cuisine]].{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|p=39}} Its creation is generally attributed to [[Lucien Olivier]].<ref name=":0" />{{sfn|Davidson|Jaine|2006}}

It is popular in the [[post-Soviet states]] and around the world. In different modern recipes, it is usually made with [[dicing|diced]] boiled [[potato]]es, [[carrot]]s and brined [[dill pickle]]s (or [[cucumber]]), together with optional [[Eggs as food|eggs]], vegetable or fruit ingredients such as green [[pea]]s, [[celeriac]], [[onion]]s and [[apples]], optional meat ingredients such as diced boiled [[Chicken as food|chicken]], cured sausage, [[ham]], or [[hot dogs]], with salt, pepper and mustard sometimes added to enhance flavor, and dressed with [[mayonnaise]].

In Russia and other post-Soviet states, as well as in Russophone communities worldwide, the salad has become one of the main dishes on ''[[zakuski]]'' tables served during New Year's Eve ([[Novy God]]) celebrations. In Poland, it is commonly served at Christmas and Easter.

==Name==
In many countries, the dish is commonly referred to as ''Russian salad'' or ''Stolichny salad''. In Iran, it is referred to as {{Langx|fa|سالاد اولیویه|Salad olivieh|label=none}} and is more commonly made with eggs and chicken. In a few Scandinavian countries (Denmark and Norway), it is called {{lang|da|italiensk salat}} (Italian salad, to acknowledge the popularity of this dish in Northern Italy—where, however, the common name is {{lang|it|insalata russa}}), and in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], it is called {{lang|nl|huzarensalade}} ([[hussar]]s' salad). In former [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] countries, it is called {{lang|sh|руска салата|italic=ruska salata}} (Russian salad). {{lang|sh|Francuska salata}} (French salad) is a similar dish.{{cn|date=May 2025}} In Romania, it is known as ''salata (de) boeuf'', which means "beef salad" in [[French language|French]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=A salad that no nation wants to call their own |url=https://www.tasteatlas.com/a-salad-that-no-nation-wants-to-call-their-own |access-date=2023-01-04 |website=tasteatlas.com}}</ref> In France, it is referred to as {{lang|fr|macédoine de légumes}}, whereas the Polish version, in which there's usually no meat, is simply known as {{lang|pl|sałatka jarzynowa}}, or "vegetable salad".{{cn|date=May 2025}}

==History==
[[File:Hermitage Restaurant in Moscow.jpg|thumb|Hermitage restaurant in the 20th century]]
The original version of the salad was invented in the 1860s by a cook of French and Belgian origin, [[Lucien Olivier]], the chef of the Hermitage, one of Moscow's most celebrated restaurants. Olivier's salad quickly became immensely popular with Hermitage regulars and became the restaurant's signature dish.{{sfn|Ayto|2013}}{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|p=39}}

[[File:Olivier Russian salad made to the Hermitage restaurant recipe.jpg|thumb|Olivier salad prepared with the Hermitage restaurant's recipe]]
At the turn of the 20th century, one of Olivier's [[sous-chef]]s, Ivan Ivanov, attempted to steal the recipe. While preparing the dressing one evening in solitude, as was his custom, Olivier was suddenly called away. Taking advantage of the opportunity, Ivanov sneaked into Olivier's private kitchen and observed his {{lang|fr|[[mise en place]]}}, which allowed him to make reasonable assumptions about the recipe of Olivier's famed dressing. Ivanov then left Olivier's employ and went to work as a chef for Moskva, a somewhat inferior restaurant, where he began to serve a suspiciously similar salad under the name "metropolitan salad" ({{langx|ru|Столичный|Stolichny|links=no}}). It was reported by the gourmets of the time, however, that the dressing on the "Stolichny" salad was of a lower quality than Olivier's.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Goldstein |first1=Darra |title=The Kingdom of Rye: A Brief History of Russian Food |date=24 May 2022 |publisher=Univ of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-38389-0 |page=7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h1tZEAAAQBAJ |language=en}}</ref>

Later, Ivanov sold the recipe for the salad to various publishing houses, which further contributed to its popularization. Due to the closure of the Hermitage restaurant in 1905, and the Olivier family's subsequent departure from Russia, the salad could now be referred to as "Olivier".

One of the first printed recipes for Olivier salad, by Aleksandrova, appearing in 1894, called for half a [[hazel grouse]], two potatoes, one small cucumber (or a large [[cornichon]]), 3–4 lettuce leaves, 3 large crayfish tails, 1/4 cup cubed aspic, 1 teaspoon of capers, 3–5 olives, and 1{{frac|1|2}} tablespoon Provençal dressing (mayonnaise).

As often happens with gourmet recipes which become popular, the ingredients which were rare, expensive, seasonal, or difficult to prepare were gradually replaced with cheaper and more readily available foods.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

==Ingredients==
[[File:John Burgess & Son 001.png|thumb|left|upright|Advertisement for mogul sauce and other condiments by John Burgess & Son]]
The earliest published recipe known to date appeared in the Russian magazine {{lang|ru|Наша пища|italic=yes}} ({{Transliteration|ru|Nasha pishcha}} {{gloss|Our Food}}) No.&nbsp;6 (31&nbsp;March 1894). This magazine, published from 1891 to 1896 and edited by M.&nbsp;Ignatiev, stated that the original recipe contained "mogul sauce" or "kabul sauce" (similar to [[Worcestershire sauce]]), manufactured by John Burgess & Son<ref group="Note">Now owned by the Greencore Group: {{cite web |url=http://www.greencore.com/content.asp?topic=history&page=200 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814024419/http://www.greencore.com/content.asp?topic=history&page=200 |archive-date=2012-08-14 |title=History |website=Greencore Group}}</ref> (the brand he reputedly used) and [[Crosse & Blackwell]].{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

The book {{lang|ru|Руководство к изучению основ кулинарного искусства|italic=yes}} ({{Transliteration|ru|Rukovodstvo k izucheniyu osnov kulinarnogo iskusstva}}, {{gloss|Guide to the Study of the Fundamentals of Culinary Art}}) (1897) by P.&nbsp;Aleksandrova gave a recipe containing [[grouse]], [[Crayfish as food|crayfish]], potatoes, cucumber, lettuce, aspic, capers, olives and mayonnaise. The author wrote that veal, partridge or chicken could be substituted, but the authentic recipe contained grouse.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

In post-revolutionary Russia, cheaper ingredients were substituted for the originals: grouse was replaced by chicken or sausage, crayfish by hard-boiled egg, cucumbers, olives and capers by pickled cucumbers and green peas.

Earlier, it always included cold meat such as [[ham]] or [[beef tongue|veal tongue]], or [[Fish (food)|fish]]. The mid-20th century restaurant version involved not just vegetables, but also pickled tongue, [[sausage]], [[lobster meat]], [[truffles]], etc., garnished with [[caper]]s, [[Anchovies as food|anchovy]] fillets, etc. Some versions molded it in [[aspic]].

In modern usage, it is usually boiled diced vegetables bound in mayonnaise, with [[Doctor's sausage|Doktorskaya-type sausage]]. The most common alternative version, where the sausage is replaced with boiled or smoked chicken, is called ''Stolichny salad'', after Ivanov's version.

A multitude of other versions, named, unnamed, and even trademarked, exist, but only Olivier and Stolichny salad have entered the common vernacular of post-Soviet states.

==Modern Olivier==
[[File:Olivierzalot (sowjetesch).jpg|thumb|Typical Soviet-style Olivier salad]]
Today's popular version of Olivier salad—containing boiled potatoes, dill pickles or fresh cucumbers, peas, eggs, carrots, onion and boiled beef/chicken or bologna, dressed with mayonnaise—is a version of Ivanov's Stolichny salad, and only faintly resembles Olivier's original creation. This version was a staple of any [[Soviet cuisine|Soviet]] holiday dinner, especially of a [[Novy God]] ([[New Year's Eve]]) dinner (to the extent that its presence was considered on a par with [[Sovetskoye Shampanskoye|Soviet Champagne]] or [[mandarin orange]]s), due to availability of components in winter. Even though more exotic foods are widely available in Russia now, its popularity has hardly diminished: this salad was and maybe still is the most traditional dish for the home New Year celebration for Russian people.<ref>[https://www.enjoyyourcooking.com/salads/russian-salad-olivier.html Russian Salad (Olivier)]</ref>

Festive Russian and post-Soviet states' homemade versions are traditionally at the cook's whim. While some of the ingredients are considered to be basic and essential, others are either favoured or dismissed as a threat to supposed authenticity.

The biggest Olivier salad, weighing {{convert|1841|kg}}, was prepared in December 2012 in [[Orenburg]].<ref>{{cite web

=== Southeastern Europe ===
[[File:Christmas table (Serbian cuisine).jpg|thumb|Serbian Christmas meal]]
In [[Serbia]], Olivier salad is called "Russian salad" and is very common on the [[New Year]] and [[Christmas]] table.
The salad is widely popular as {{lang|sh-Cyrl|руска салата}} ({{lang|sh-Latn|ruska salata}}) in [[Bulgarian cuisine|Bulgaria]], [[Serbian cuisine|Serbia]], and [[North Macedonian cuisine|North Macedonia]], and {{lang|sq|sallatë ruse}} in [[Albanian cuisine|Albania]]. The Bulgarian version of the salad usually consists of potatoes, carrots, peas, pickles and some sort of salami or ham. In [[Bosnia and Herzegovina cuisine|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], both the {{lang|sh-Latn|ruska salata}} and {{lang|sh-Latn|francuska salata}} (which is essentially Russian salad prepared without meat) are very popular, especially during holidays.{{Citation needed|date=January 2025}}

In [[Croatian cuisine|Croatia]] and [[Slovenian cuisine|Slovenia]], it is typically prepared without meat, and is usually called {{lang|hr|francuska salata}} in Croatian and {{lang|sl|francoska solata}} in Slovene, both meaning {{gloss|French salad}}. On top of the typical peas, corn and carrots, some Croatian varieties also contain diced apples.

The [[Romanian cuisine|Romanian]] variant, called {{lang|ro|[[salată de boeuf]]}} ("beef salad"), is considered a traditional dish. It is a combination of finely chopped beef (or chicken) and root vegetables, folded in mayonnaise and finished with [[murături]], traditional Romanian mixed pickles. It can also be made vegetarian.{{Citation needed|date=January 2025}}

In [[Turkish cuisine|Turkey]], it is known as {{lang|tr|rus salatası}} ("Russian salad"). The Turkish version consists of boiled and diced carrots and potatoes, sliced cucumber pickles, boiled peas and mayonnaise, and is sometimes decorated with boiled and sliced eggs, black olives and beetroot pickles. It is served as [[meze]] and is used as a filling for some sandwiches and [[Baked potato|kumpir]] (jacket potato). Another Turkish name for Olivier salad is {{lang|tr|Amerikan salatası}} {{gloss|American salad}}, a euphemistic misnomer originating from the [[Cold War]] period.{{Citation needed|date=January 2025}}

=== Central Europe ===
In Slovakia, it is called {{lang|sk|zemiakový šalát}} {{gloss|potato salad}}. There are several versions; however, it typically consists of boiled and cubed vegetables (potatoes, carrots), finely chopped onions and pickles in a mayonnaise dressing, often with diced hard-boiled eggs and canned green peas. It is seasoned with salt, black pepper and mustard. Some fluid from the pickles may also be added.{{Citation needed|date=January 2025}}

In [[Czech cuisine|Czech]], it is called simply {{lang|cs|bramborový salát}} {{gloss|potato salad}}. It consists of boiled and cubed vegetables (potatoes, carrots, parsley and celery root), finely chopped onions and pickles in a mayonnaise dressing, often with diced hard-boiled eggs, some kind of soft salami and canned green peas. It is the side-dish of choice to go with [[schnitzel]] or breaded [[carp]], staple Christmas meals in the Czech Republic.{{Citation needed|date=January 2025}}

[[File:Sałatka warzywna z majonezem.jpg|thumb|left|{{lang|pl|Sałatka jarzynowa}}, [[Polish cuisine|Poland]]]]
[[Polish cuisine|Polish]] {{lang|pl|sałatka jarzynowa}} or {{lang|pl|sałatka warzywna}} ({{gloss|vegetable salad}}, often simply called {{lang|pl|sałatka}}) is vegetarian, consisting of peas, hard boiled eggs, and the [[Mirepoix (cuisine)|mirepoix]], always cut into small cubes, seasoned with mayonnaise, salt, pepper. Recipes usually vary by region (tart apples or pickles can be added) and even by household, sometimes even adding meat (e.g. ham). One such notable exception is {{lang|pl|szałot}} ({{IPA|pl|ˈʂawɔt}}), a [[Silesian cuisine|Silesian]] variety which may include not only boiled potatoes, carrots, peas and boiled eggs, but also bacon, sausages or [[pickled herring]].<ref>Marek Szołtysek, ''Kuchnia śląska'', Wydawnictwo Śląskie ABC, Rybnik 2003, {{ISBN|83-88966-07-3}} (in Polish)</ref> Such salads are often served on family celebrations, in particular on [[Christmas Eve]].

In [[Hungary]], the meatless version is called {{lang|hu|franciasaláta}} {{gloss|French salad}}. Versions with meat added are called {{lang|hu|[[:hu:Orosz hússaláta|orosz hússaláta]]}} {{gloss|Russian meat salad}}. With or without meat, it is a popular food all year round.
[[File:Ensaladilla Rusa - Madrid corrected.JPG|thumbnail|{{lang|es|Ensaladilla rusa}}, [[Madrid]], [[Spanish cuisine|Spain]]]]

=== Southern Europe ===
In Greece, it can be found on almost any restaurant's menu and is called {{lang|el|ρώσικη σαλάτα}} {{Transliteration|el|rossiki salata}}; it usually contains no meat. {{lang|es|Ensaladilla rusa}} {{gloss|Russian little salad}} is widely consumed in [[Spanish cuisine|Spain]] and it is served as a [[Tapas|tapa]] in many bars. It typically consists of minced boiled potato, minced boiled carrots, canned tuna, minced boiled eggs, peas, and mayonnaise.<ref>{{cite web|title=ensaladilla-rusa-recipe-russian-potato-salad|url=https://spanishsabores.com/2013/04/04/ensaladilla-rusa-recipe-russian-potato-salad/|access-date=2014-12-29|website=spanishsabores.com|date=4 April 2013}}</ref> In Italy, {{lang|it|insalata russa}} has the same ingredients. A similar version is also popular in Portugal, where it is called {{lang|it|salada russa}}. It is usually served either as a standalone dish or as a garnish to fish dishes, particularly fish fillets.

=== Northern Europe ===
In Iceland and Norway, it is called ''russisk salat'', and contains carrots and green peas in mayonnaise dressing. It may also include small shrimp.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Delikat Russisk Rekesalat |url=https://mills.no/delikat/produkt/delikat-russisk-rekesalat/ |access-date=2022-06-05 |website=Delikat |language=nb-NO}}</ref> Often the salad is paired with smoked meat on bread. A similar but distinct salad known as {{lang|da|[[:da:Italiensk salat|italiensk salat]]}} ( this link provides a different recipe for Scandinavian {{lang|da|[[:da:Italiensk salat|italiensk salat]]}} and does not verify any connection to Olivier salad so {{citation needed|date=January 2025}} ) is also available in Scandinavian countries, consisting of shredded cabbage and carrots in a mayonnaise dressing.{{citation needed|date=January 2025}} ''Russisk salat'' and ''italiensk salat'' are often confused.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mærkelige madnavne: Hvorfor hedder det italiensk salat og russisk salat? {{!}} Samvirke |url=https://samvirke.dk/artikler/maerkelige-madnavne-hvorfor-hedder-det-italiensk-salat-og-russisk-salat |access-date=2022-06-06 |website=samvirke.dk |language=da}}</ref> In Finland, the regional salad {{lang|fi|italiansalaatti}} contains carrots, peas and ham in mayonnaise dressing but replaces potatoes with spaghetti or macaroni. In the Netherlands, there is a similar salad called {{lang|nl|huzarensalade}} {{gloss|hussar salad}}, but this salad already existed in the 1840s. Its name probably derives from the Dutch hussar regiments, and refers to the original ingredient of horsemeat.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://neerlandistiek.nl/2022/01/etymologica-de-huzarensalade/|author=Nicoline van der Sijs|date=2022-10-01|publisher=Neerlandistiek.nl|title= Etymologica: de huzarensalade}}</ref>

===Asia===
[[File:Xa lat Nga corrected.JPG|thumb|left|Russian salad, [[Hanoi]], [[Cuisine of Vietnam|Vietnam]]]]

Olivier salad ({{langx|fa|سالاد الیویه}}, sâlâd-e olivier) is a popular side dish in [[Iranian cuisine|Iran]], where it is known as ''sâlâd-e Olivier'' (Olivier salad) and usually made with potatoes, eggs, Persian pickled cucumbers, carrots, chicken, peas and mayonnaise; it is a popular sandwich filler.<ref>[http://www.mypersiankitchen.com/salad-olivieh/ Salad Olivieh - My Persian Kitchen<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

[[File:Russian Salad..JPG|thumb|Russian salad, [[Cuisine of Karachi|Karachi]], [[Pakistan]]]]
It is a popular salad in [[Vietnam]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistani cuisine|Pakistan]], and [[Indian cuisine|India]] as well, where it is usually made with potatoes, peas, apples or pineapples, and mayonnaise and is frequently used as a side dish in cafes. Another version of Russian salad is also very popular in Pakistan which bears no resemblance to Olivier salad and instead is a cabbage and apple slaw.{{Citation needed|date=January 2025}}

[[Potato salad#Japanese potato salad|Japanese potato salad]] ({{Transliteration|ja|potesara}}, {{lang|ja|ポテサラ}}), is often said to be a [[yoshoku]] version of the Olivier salad, differing in semi-mashed consistency of the potato, chopped ham as a main meat ingredient (instead of traditional poultry) and a liberal use of [[rice vinegar]] and [[karashi]] mustard in its dressing.

Olivier salad is believed to have been introduced as a "Capital salad" or "Niislel salad"  in [[Mongolian cuisine|Mongolia]] during the Soviet period. It usually consists of minced ham, minced boiled eggs, minced boiled carrots, and potatoes dressed with mayonnaise. It is widely popular amongst Mongolians, especially during the festive seasons.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

In the early 20th century, a large number of Russians lived in Shanghai.  They were called [[Shanghai Russians]] and formed the largest European groups living in Shanghai.  As a result, Olivier salad became a common household dish among local Chinese living in the city center of Shanghai.  It is called [[Shanghai-style salad]] and is one of the most popular dishes in [[Haipai cuisine]], a Western-style cooking that is unique to Shanghai.  The traditional Shanghai variation of Olivier salad consists of potatoes, egg whites and a type of sausage ([https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/红肠 红肠]) which is similar to the Polish kielbasa sausage, but produced locally in Shanghai and is similar to the sausage with the same Chinese name produced in Harbin, China.  Sometimes apples or green peas are added to the salad.  Egg yolk is used to make mayonnaise for the salad dressing.  Over time, new variations evolved with additional ingredients added or with different salad dressing used.<ref>{{Citation |title=上海色拉 |date=2022-10-21 |work=维基百科，自由的百科全书 |url=https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E4%B8%8A%E6%B5%B7%E8%89%B2%E6%8B%89 |access-date=2025-02-02 |language=zh-Hans}}</ref>

===Latin America===
[[File:Ensalada rusa argentina.JPG|thumb|Argentinian {{lang|es|ensalada rusa}}]]
The dish is also very popular in many Latin American countries where it is called {{lang|es|ensalada rusa}} and has been reduced to its minimum: minced boiled potatoes and carrots, green beans and abundant mayonnaise-based dressing. In [[Argentina]], it is usually served on its own as a first course, or with a very thinly sliced beef wrapping called [[matambre]], in a dish called {{lang|es|matambre con rusa}}. Argentines of Eastern European Jewish origin may make the salad with tuna. In [[Peru]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Argentina]], it is a traditional Christmas side dish. In the [[Dominican Republic]], the dish is made with diced boiled vegetables including beets, carrots, potatoes and sometimes corn, mixed with mayonnaise and spices. It is often served as a side dish.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}} The version most frequently prepared and served in [[Brazil]] is similar to that in other Latin American countries, and often called simply {{lang|pt|maionese}}.
