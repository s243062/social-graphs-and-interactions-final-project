==History==
The cooking method for the Philippine ''adobo'' is indigenous to the Philippines. The various [[History of the Philippines (900–1521)|precolonial]] peoples of the Philippine archipelago often cooked or prepared their food with vinegar and salt in various techniques to [[Food preservation|preserve]] them in the [[tropical|tropical climate]]. Vinegar, in particular, is one of the most important ingredients in Filipino cuisine, with the main traditional types being [[coconut vinegar|coconut]], [[cane vinegar|cane]], [[nipa palm vinegar|nipa palm]], and [[kaong palm vinegar|kaong palm]]. These are all linked to traditional [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] [[fermentation]].<ref name="hosking" /><ref name="Ponseca" /><ref name="Dacanay">{{Cite news |last=Dacanay |first=Barbara Mae Naredo |date=May 1, 2019 |title=There's nothing Spanish about adobo—should we ditch its Spanish name? |work=ANC X |url=https://www.abs-cbn.com/ancx/food-drink/features/05/01/19/theres-nothing-spanish-about-adoboshould-we-ditch-its-spanish-name |access-date=March 10, 2021}}</ref>
[[File:Chicken Adobo over rice.jpg|thumb|left|Chicken ''adobo'' on white [[rice]]]]
There are four main traditional cooking methods using vinegar in the Philippines: ''[[kinilaw|kiniláw]]'' (raw seafood in vinegar and spices), ''[[paksiw|paksíw]]'' (a broth of meat with vinegar and spices), ''sangkutsá'' (pre-cooked [[braising]] of meat in vinegar and spices), and finally ''adobo'' (a stew of vinegar, garlic, salt/soy sauce, and other spices).<ref name="asianjournal.wordpress.com">{{Cite web |date=July 14, 2008 |title=ADOBO: A History of the Country's National Dish |url=http://asianjournal.wordpress.com/2008/07/14/adobo-a-history-of-the-countrys-national-dish/}}</ref><ref name="rodell" /><ref name="estrella" /><ref name="hosking" /> It is believed that paksíw, sangkutsá, and ''adobo'' are all derivations of ''kiniláw''. They are also related to cooking techniques like ''[[sinigang|sinigáng]]'' and ''[[pinangat na isda|pinangát na isdâ]]'' that also have a sour broth, albeit using fruits like [[calamansi]], [[tamarind]], unripe [[mango]]es, [[bilimbi]], [[Sandoricum koetjape|''santól'']], and [[carambola|star fruit]] as souring agents instead of vinegar.<ref name="Ponseca">{{Cite book |last1=Ponseca |first1=Nicole |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=63BMDwAAQBAJ |title=I Am a Filipino: And This Is How We Cook |last2=Trinidad |first2=Miguel |date=2018 |publisher=Artisan Books |isbn=9781579658823}}</ref>

When the [[Spanish Empire]] colonized the Philippines in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, they encountered the ''adobo'' cooking process. It was first recorded in the 1613 dictionary ''[[Vocabulario de la lengua tagala]]'' compiled by the Spanish [[Franciscan]] missionary, [[Pedro de San Buenaventura]]. He referred to it as ''adobo de los naturales'' ("''[[adobo]]'' of the native [peoples]").<ref name="rodell" /><ref name="estrella">{{Cite web |last=Estrella, Serna |date=June 22, 2013 |title=Adobo: The History of A National Favorite |url=http://www.pepper.ph/the-history-of-adobo/ |access-date=March 21, 2016 |publisher=Pepper.ph}}</ref><ref name="hosking">{{Cite book |last=Lim-Castillo, Pia |title=Authenticity in the Kitchen |publisher=Prospect Books |year=2006 |isbn=9781903018477 |editor-last=Hosking, Richard |series=Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery 2005 |page=296&ndash;298 |chapter=Traditional Philippine Vinegars and their Role in Shaping the Culinary Culture |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HflTVd898PAC}}</ref> 

The Spanish also applied the term ''adobo'' to any native dish that was marinated before consumption. However, the concept of cooking ''adobo'' already existed long before the arrival of the Spanish in 1521.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |title=What Is Adobo?

[[File:Chicken adobo (Philippines) 2.jpg|thumb|Chicken ''adobo'' with [[broccoli]]]]
While the Filipino ''adobo'' and Spanish style ''adobo'' share vinegar and garlic, they are culturally distinct dishes with different ingredients and culinary traditions.<ref name="tayag" /> Unlike the Spanish and Latin American ''adobo'', the main ingredients of Philippine ''adobo'' are ingredients native to [[Southeast Asia]], which include vinegar (made from [[Vinegar#Palm|palm sap]] or [[Vinegar#Cane|sugarcane]]), [[soy sauce]] (typically substituting salt), [[black peppercorn]]s, and [[bay leaves]] (traditionally ''[[Cinnamomum]]'' spp. leaves; but in modern times, usually ''[[Laurus nobilis]]''). Unlike Spanish and Latin American adobo, Philippine ''adobo'' does not traditionally use [[chili pepper|chilis]], [[paprika]], [[oregano]], or [[tomato]]es. Instead, they only share similarities in their primary use of vinegar and garlic. Philippine ''adobo'' has a characteristically salty and sour, and often sweet taste, in contrast to Spanish and Mexican ''adobos'', which are spicier or infused with oregano.<ref name="estrella" /><ref name="Zulu2017">{{Cite news |last=Zulu |first=Mijon |date=November 19, 2017 |title=What Is the Difference Between Mexican and Filipino Adobo? |work=Chowhound |url=https://www.chowhound.com/food-news/191932/what-is-the-difference-between-mexican-and-filipino-adobo/ |access-date=January 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=This Chicken Adobo Is a Flavor Bomb of Salty-Sour Goodness |url=https://www.cookinglight.com/recipes/chicken-adobo-0 |access-date=January 10, 2019 |website=CookingLight}}</ref>

While the Philippine ''adobo'' can be considered ''adobo'' in the Spanish sense—a marinated dish—the Philippine usage is much more specific to a cooking process (rather than a specific recipe) and is not restricted to meat.<ref name="tayag" /> Typically, [[pork]] or [[Chicken as food|chicken]], or a combination of both, is slowly cooked in [[vinegar]], crushed [[garlic]], [[bay leaf|bay leaves]], [[black pepper]]corns, and [[soy sauce]].

There are numerous variants of the ''adobo'' recipes in the Philippines.<ref name="Indigenous" /> The most basic ingredient of ''adobo'' is vinegar, which is usually [[vinegar#Varieties|coconut vinegar]], [[rice vinegar]], or cane vinegar (although sometimes [[white wine]] or [[cider vinegar]] can also be used).

''Adobong dilaw'' ("yellow ''adobo''"), which uses ''kalawag'' ([[turmeric]]) to provide the yellow colouring as well as adding in a different flavour, can be found in [[Batangas]], the [[Visayas]], and [[Mindanao]] regions. 

The proportion of ingredients like soy sauce, bay leaves, garlic, or black pepper can vary. The amount and thickness of the sauce also varies as some like their ''adobo'' dry while some like it saucy. Other ingredients can sometimes be used; like ''[[siling labuyo]]'', [[bird's eye chili]], [[Jalapeño|jalapeño pepper]], [[Bell pepper|red bell pepper]], [[olive oil]], [[onion]]s, [[brown sugar]], [[potato]]es, [[pineapple]], or lemon-lime sodas like [[Sprite_(drink)|Sprite]].

''Adobo'' has been called the quintessential Philippine stew, served with rice both at daily meals and at feasts.<ref name="Oxford" /> It is commonly packed for Filipino [[Mountaineering|mountaineers]] and travelers because it keeps well without refrigeration. Its relatively long shelf-life is due to one of its primary ingredients, [[vinegar]], which inhibits the growth of [[bacteria]].<ref name="rodell">{{Cite book |last=Rodell, Paul A. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y1CVR74_KHQC&q=Philippine+Adobo+variation&pg=PA102 |title=Culture and Customs of the Philippines |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2002 |isbn=9780313304156 |series=Culture and Customs of Asia |location=Westport, CT |page=102}}</ref>

==Other uses==
Outside of the dish itself, the flavor of ''adobo'' has been developed commercially and adapted to other foods.  A number of local Philippine snack products such as [[Cornick (food)|cornicks]], [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], chips, noodle soups, and corn crackers, market their items as "''adobo'' flavored".{{cn|date=October 2024}}

==Standardization==
In 2021, the Bureau of Philippine Standards of the [[Department of Trade and Industry (Philippines)|Department of Trade and Industry]] (DTI-BPS) of the Philippines unveiled plans to standardize the most popular [[Filipino cuisine|Filipino dishes]] to make it easier to promote them internationally as well as keep their cultural identity. Philippine ''adobo'' will be the first of such dishes to be standardized. The definition will be set by a technical committee headed by Glenda Rosales Barreto, and includes representatives from the academia, government departments, the food industry, chefs, and food writers. The main reference will be ''Kulinarya: A Guidebook to Philippine Cuisine'' (2008), authored by Barreto and the committee vice-chairperson Myrna Segismundo, both notable chefs of Filipino cuisine in their own right.<ref>{{Cite web |date=July 9, 2021 |title=Standardization of famous Filipino dishes advances! |url=https://www.dti.gov.ph/news/standardization-of-famous-filipino-dishes-advances/ |website=Department of Trade and Industry}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Canivel |first=Roy Stephen C. |date=July 10, 2021 |title=Committee to decide what is 'standard' adobo |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1457952/committee-to-decide-what-is-standard-adobo}}</ref> The announcement has received some criticism from the public, but the DTI-BPS clarified that it's not mandatory and will only aim to define a basic traditional recipe that can serve as a benchmark for determining the authenticity of Filipino dishes in the international setting.<ref name="Ramos">{{Cite news |last=Ramos |first=Christia Marie |date=July 12, 2021 |title=DTI says standardizing Philippine adobo only for international promotion |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1458643/dti-says-standardizing-our-adobo-only-for-international-promotion |access-date=July 13, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Punzalan |first=Jamaine |date=July 12, 2021 |title=Standard adobo, sinigang, sisig?
