The dish is widespread and is also a traditional dish from North Africa to South Africa. The base ingredients of githeri are used in many other meals from different regions. 

Both fresh and dried beans and maize can be used for githeri. Githeri can also be made into a stew with the addition of vegetables, potatoes, and sometimes meat. It can also be used to make [[mukimo]] by adding potatoes, bananas and greens, and mashing up the mixture.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-09-15 |title=Mukimo ya githeri Recipe by Leyona Wangari |url=https://cookpad.com/ke/recipes/10629107-mukimo-ya-githeri |access-date=2023-06-06 |website=Cookpad |language=en}}</ref>
