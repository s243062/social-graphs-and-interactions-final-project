A '''churro''' ({{IPA|es|ˈtʃuro}}, {{IPA|pt|ˈʃuʁu}}) is a type of [[List of fried dough foods|fried dough]] from [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese cuisine|Portuguese]] cuisine, made with [[choux pastry]] [[dough]] piped into hot oil with a piping bag and large closed star tip or similar shape. They are also found in [[Latin American cuisine]], [[Philippine cuisine]] and in other areas that have received immigration from Spanish and Portuguese-speaking countries, especially in [[France]] and the [[Southwestern United States]].

In [[Spain]], churros can either be thin (and sometimes knotted) or long and thick, where they are known as ''porras'', ''jeringos'', or ''tejeringos''<ref>{{Cite web |last=Miguel |first=Amando de |date=28 January 2008 |title=Variaciones regionales del habla popular |url=https://www.libertaddigital.com/opinion/2008-01-28/amando-de-miguel-variaciones-regionales-del-habla-popular-5194707/ |access-date=8 October 2024 |website=[[Libertad Digital]] |language=es}}</ref><ref name="Zaera">{{Cite web |last=Zaera |first=Beatriz |date=3 December 2024 |title=Los churros vienen de China" y otros grandes bulos gastronómicos que corren por las redes |url=https://elpais.com/gastronomia/el-comidista/2024-12-03/los-churros-vienen-de-china-y-otros-grandes-bulos-gastronomicos-que-corren-por-las-redes.html/ |access-date=3 December 2024 |website=[[El País]] |language=es}}</ref> in some regions. They are normally eaten for breakfast dipped in coffee, or in [[hot chocolate]] for an afternoon snack. There are also two slightly different snacks in Portugal, called ''porra'' and [[fartura]], which are filled with jelly instead of the ''[[Dulce de leche|doce de leite]]'' traditional to [[Brazilian cuisine|Brazilian]] churros.<ref>{{Cite web |date=17 November 2015 |title=Cinco placas portuguesas que são muito estranhas para brasileiros |url=https://orapois.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2015/11/17/cinco-placas-portuguesas-que-sao-muito-estranhas-para-brasileiros/ |access-date=17 July 2020 |website=[[Folha de S.Paulo]] |language=pt}}</ref>

==History==
The origin of churros is unclear. But according to food historian [[Michael Krondl]], "today's churro is not that different from a recipe for a flour and water [[fritter]] that you find in ''[[Apicius]]'', a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] cookbook dating from the 1st century AD. And there are recipes from the [[Ancient Greeks]], but it's probably even older than that. In the [[Mediterranean basin]] it's basically been around forever".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200616-the-complex-origins-of-beloved-churros|date=17 June 2020|first=Mike|last=Randolph|website=[[BBC]]|title=The complex origin of beloved churros}}</ref>

But there are also other theories: one of them is that the churro was made by Spanish [[shepherd]]s to substitute for fresh baked goods. Churro paste was easy to make and fry in an open fire in the mountains, where shepherds spend most of their time,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ifood.tv/network/churro |title=Churro Encyclopedia |access-date=2011-12-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929185710/http://www.ifood.tv/network/churro |archive-date=2011-09-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/18/churros-the-hidden-history_n_930791.html |title=Churros: The Hidden History |date= 2011-08-18 |access-date=2011-10-16 |work=[[The Huffington Post]]}}</ref> but the nomadic lifestyle of the shepherds and the large quantities of oil or fat needed to fry churros make that unlikely.<ref name="Zaera"/>

Another theory, considered a hoax by some people<ref name="Zaera"/> suggests the concept was brought to [[Europe]] from [[China]] by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/the-hidden-history-of-churros|title=The Hidden History of Churros|website=Fox News|date=9 December 2016}}</ref> The Portuguese sailed for the [[Orient]]; as they returned from [[Ming-dynasty]] China to [[Portugal]], they brought along with them new culinary techniques.  One included altering dough for ''[[youtiao]]'', also known as ''yóuzháguǐ'' in [[southern China]], which bears a resemblance to the churro.{{citation needed|date=August 2024}} The new pastry was soon introduced to Spain, where it was modified to have the dough extruded through a star-shaped [[nozzle]] (compare a [[piping bag]]) rather than pulled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theprisma.co.uk/2011/07/17/churros-a-secret-history/|title=Churros: a secret history|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223032822/http://www.theprisma.co.uk/2011/07/17/churros-a-secret-history/|archive-date=23 February 2012}}</ref>

==Etymology==

According to the ''[[Diccionario de la lengua española]]'', ''churro'' is [[onomatopoeic]], ultimately imitative of the sound of frying.<ref>{{cite web|title=churro|url=https://dle.rae.es/?w=churro|website=Diccionario de la lengua española}}</ref>

[[File:Churro-Vendor.ogg|thumb|A [[street vendor]] in [[Colombia]] making churros]]
Churros are fried until they become crunchy, and may be sprinkled with sugar. The surface of a churro is ridged due to having been piped from a churrera, a syringe-like tool with a star-shaped nozzle. Churros are generally [[Prism (geometry)|prisms]] in shape, and may be straight, curled or spirally twisted.

Like [[pretzel]]s, churros are sold by street vendors, who may fry them freshly on the street stand and sell them hot. In Spain and much of Latin America, churros are available in cafes for [[breakfast]], although they may be eaten throughout the day as a snack. Specialized ''churrerías'', in the form of a shop or a trailer, can be found during the holiday period. In addition, countries like [[Colombia]], [[Peru]], [[Spain]] and [[Venezuela]] have churrerías throughout their streets. In Portugal, they are commonly eaten at carnivals, fairs and other celebrations, where they are made freshly at street stands.

The dough is a mixture of flour, water and salt. Some versions are made of potato dough. Depending on the recipe, it may not be [[vegan]], as they can contain butter, milk or eggs.

In [[Seville]] ([[Andalusia]]), the name "calientes" (meaning hot) or "calentitos de rueda" is sometimes used instead of the word ''churro''. These tend to refer to the thicker variant, called ''porra''. Calientes are usually fried in the shape of a continuous spiral and cut into portions afterwards. The center of the spiral is thicker and softer, and for many a delicacy in itself. The standard "churro" is also sold under the name "calentitos de [[potatoes|papas]]", the name referring to the softer [[mashed potato]]-like texture.<ref>{{cite news|last=Díaz|first=Ana|title=Calentitos versus churros|url=http://sevillaciudad.sevilla.abc.es/reportajes/triana/sociedad-triana/velarde-y-borromeo-calentitos-versus-churros/|access-date=19 June 2014|publisher=ABC|date=2012-10-31|archive-date=2019-12-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191231044152/http://sevillaciudad.sevilla.abc.es/reportajes/triana/sociedad-triana/velarde-y-borromeo-calentitos-versus-churros/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Una de calentitos|url=http://todaunaamalgama.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/una-de-calentitos.html|website=Toda una amalgama|date=18 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=La muralla duda: rueda o papa|url=http://www.diariodesevilla.es/sevilla/detail.php?id=426619|access-date=19 June 2014|publisher=Diario de Sevilla|date=18 May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827112733/http://www.diariodesevilla.es/sevilla/detail.php?id=426619|archive-date=27 August 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In parts of eastern Andalusia, a much thinner dough is used, which does not allow for the typical ridges to be formed on the surface of the churro. The final result therefore has a smooth surface, and is more pliable and of a slightly thinner diameter than standard Spanish churros. Another difference is that sugar is never sprinkled on them, because the flavour is not considered suitable.{{Citation needed|date=September 2025}}

Filled, straight ''churros'' are found in Cuba (with fruit, such as [[guava]]), [[Brazil]] (with chocolate, ''[[dulce de leche|doce de leite]]'', among others), and in [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], [[Chile]], [[Mexico]] (usually filled with ''[[dulce de leche]]'' or ''[[cajeta]]'' but also with chocolate and vanilla), and in Colombia and Venezuela (with [[Bocadillo (dessert)|bocadillo]], [[dulce de leche|arequipe]] or sweetened [[condensed milk]]). In Spain, a considerably wider diameter is used to accommodate the filling.{{Citation needed|date=September 2025}} 

In [[Uruguay]], churros can also come in a [[umami|savoury]] version, filled with melted cheese.{{Citation needed|date=September 2025}}

In the [[Philippines]], ''churros'' are typically straight, or bent into U-shapes or circular shapes dusted with white sugar and are popular during Christmas.<ref name="cv">{{cite web |last=Veneracion |first=Connie |title=The Spanish Influence on Filipino Cuisine |url=https://www.thespruceeats.com/the-spanish-influence-on-filipino-cuisine-3030287 |website=The Spruce Eats |access-date=14 December 2018}}</ref><ref name="aranas">{{cite book|author= Aranas, Jennifer|title =The Filipino-American Kitchen: Traditional Recipes, Contemporary Flavors|publisher =Tuttle Publishing|year =2012|isbn =9781462904914|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=71TRAgAAQBAJ}}</ref><ref name="aia">{{cite web |title=How to Cook Churros con Tsokolate with Cocoa Tablea Drink |url=https://www.asianinamericamag.com/2013/01/churros-con-tsokolate-filipino-sweet-fritters-with-spanish-cocoa/ |website=Asian in America |date=5 January 2013 |access-date=14 December 2018}}</ref>

In [[Thailand]], ''churros'' are commonly referred to as ''Patonggo Spain''  ({{langx|th|ปาท่องโก๋สเปน}}, {{lit|Spanish deep-fried dough stick}}). The fried dough itself is originally called ''[[youtiao]]'' in Chinese, but it is known locally in Thailand as ''[[youtiao#Thailand|patonggo]]''.<ref name="o">{{cite web |accessdate=2024-08-31 |title=ชูโรส ปาท่องโก๋สเปน แป้งกรอบนานเนื้อนุ่มในทำเองได้ |url=https://cooking.kapook.com/view193567.html|date=2018-05-22 |work=Kapook.com |language=th}}</ref>

Churros in American [[theme park]]s and street fairs are most often rolled in [[cinnamon sugar]] or other flavored sugars.{{Citation needed|date=September 2025}}
