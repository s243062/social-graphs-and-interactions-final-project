'''Crème caramel''' ({{IPA|fr|kʁɛm kaʁamɛl|lang}}), '''flan''', '''caramel pudding''', '''condensed milk pudding''', or '''caramel custard''' is a [[custard]] [[dessert]] with a layer of clear [[caramel]] sauce.

==History==
[[Custard]] has a long documented history, but crème caramel or flan in its modern form, with soft caramel on top, and prepared and cooked using a [[bain-marie]], is first documented in {{Lang|fr|La cuisinière provençale}} by [[Jean-Baptiste Reboul|Jean Baptiste Reboul]] published in 1897.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Perrier-Robert |first=Annie |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gk2xWRx5sgIC&q=%22reboul%22&pg=PT646 |title=Dictionnaire de la gourmandise |date=2012-10-18 |publisher=Groupe Robert Laffont |isbn=978-2-221-13403-0 |language=fr}}</ref>

In the late 20th century, crème caramel was common in European restaurants. The food historian [[Alan Davidson (food writer)|Alan Davidson]] speculates that this may have been because the dish could be prepared in bulk, in advance.<ref>Davidson, ''s.v.'' crème caramel</ref>

==Etymology==
In this context, {{lang|fr|crème}} in French means '[[custard]]'. The names {{Lang|fr|crème (caramel) renversée}} (French) and {{Lang|es|crema volteada}} (Spanish) allude to the custard being turned over to be served.

Both ''crème caramel'' ({{gloss|caramel cream}}) and ''flan'' are French names; however, ''flan'' has come to have different meanings in different regions.

In Spanish-speaking countries (and often in the United States), crème caramel is known as {{lang|es|flan}}. This was originally a Spanish-language usage. However, in North America the word is now best known in Latin American contexts; the other meaning is less common. Elsewhere, including in Britain, the English word [[Flan (pie)|flan]] means a type of [[tart]] somewhat like a [[quiche]].

The Modern English word ''flan'' comes from French {{lang|fr|flan}}, from [[Old French]] {{Lang|fro|flaon}}, in turn from [[Medieval Latin]] {{Lang|la|fladonem}}, derived from the [[Old High German]] {{Lang|goh|flado}}, a sort of flat cake, probably from an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] root for 'flat' or 'broad'.<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 2nd Edition (1989); [[Petit Robert]] 1973.</ref>[[Image:Flan con nata.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A restaurant prepared order of crème caramel|Restaurant-prepared order of crème caramel, with sauce and garnish]]

==Preparation==
Crème caramel is a variant of plain custard (crème) where sugar syrup cooked to caramel stage is poured into the mold before adding the custard base. It is usually cooked in a [[bain-marie]] on a stovetop or in the oven in a water bath. It is turned and served with the caramel sauce on top, hence the alternate French names {{Lang|fr|crème (caramel) renversée}} or '{{Lang|fr|crème renversée au caramel}}. The milk may be flavored with vanilla, cinnamon, or lemon peel. The resulting texture is gelatinous and creamy.

Turning out larger dishes requires care, as the custard easily splits. Larger dishes also require more care to avoid undercooking the interior or overcooking the exterior. Thus, crème caramel is often cooked and served in individual [[ramekin]]s. The objective is to obtain a homogeneous and smooth cream on the surface of the crème caramel with a liquid caramel base. Cooking it in a [[bain-marie]] avoids burning the caramel.

===Imitations===
An imitation of crème caramel may be prepared from "instant flan powder", which is thickened with [[agar]] or [[carrageenan]] rather than eggs. In some [[Latin America]]n countries, the true custard version is known as {{gloss|milk flan}} ({{lang|es|flan de leche}}) or even {{gloss|milk cheese}}, and the substitute version is known as simply ''flan''.

==Regional varieties==
[[File:Creme Caramel India.JPG|thumb|upright|Caramel custard served at a restaurant in Mangalore, India]]

===Argentina and Uruguay===
[[Image:Flan con dulce de leche.jpg|right|thumb|Argentine flan and ''[[dulce de leche]]'']]

===Brazil and Venezuela===
In [[Venezuela]] and [[Brazil]], it is often made with [[condensed milk]], milk, eggs, and caramelized sugar on top. The Venezuelan version is known as ''quesillo'' ("small cheese") and in Brazil, a local version is known as ''pudim'', specifically ''pudim de leite'' ("milk pudding"), though the traditional ''flan'' is also commercially available. Pudim can have variations of flavor, such as chocolate, coconut, paçoca (peanut candy), cheese, and others, condensed milk pudding being a base recipe.

===Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand===
In [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], and [[Thailand]], crème caramel often made with condensed milk, milk, coconut milk (as alternative), coconut cream, eggs and caramelized sugar on top.

===Caribbean===
In many Caribbean countries, the inclusion of coconut, condensed milk and evaporated milk is widespread. The milk base may also be flavored with nuts and fruits.

===Chile===
In [[Chile]], ''Leche asada''<ref>{{cite web|title=The Epic Food and Landscape of Patagonia|url=http://www.saveur.com/patagonia-andes-restaurants-travel/|access-date=2020-07-21|website=Saveur|date=18 March 2019|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Leche asada|url=https://www.solopostres.com/leche-asada-7528/|access-date=2020-07-21|website=www.solopostres.com|date=13 February 2015}}</ref> or 'roasted milk' is similar to Crème caramel because it is made with the same ingredients, but ''Leche asada'' has a less smooth texture and is baked directly, which creates a toasted layer on the surface. In Chile, it is often eaten with ''[[dulce de membrillo]]'' ([[quince]] jelly) or [[condensed milk]].

===Costa Rica===

===France===
Regional variations of crème caramel in [[France]] include:<ref>{{cite book |last=Larousse |first=Librairie |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mmWBEAAAQBAJ |title=Larousse Gastronomique: The World's Greatest Culinary Encyclopedia, Completely Revised and Updated |date=2022-08-30 |publisher=Clarkson Potter/Ten Speed |isbn=978-0-593-57774-5 |language=en}}</ref>

* ''Crème Renversée à la Normande'': This variation of crème caramel is specific to the Normandy region of France. It is made with the addition of Calvados, an apple brandy produced in Normandy, which gives the dessert a distinct apple flavor.
* ''Crème Caramel à la Bretonne'': This variation hails from Brittany and is made with the addition of salted butter, which adds a savory element to the dessert. The salted butter caramelizes with the sugar to create a unique flavor profile.
* ''Crème Caramel à la Provençale'': In the Provence region, crème caramel is often flavored with lavender or orange blossom water, giving it a floral and aromatic twist.
* ''Crème Caramel à la Parisienne'': This variation is commonly found in Parisian restaurants and is typically made with whole milk and egg yolks for a rich and creamy texture. It is often served in individual portions or as a large version.

===India===

Caramel custard is popular, especially in the larger coastal cities, and in former [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colonies such as [[Goa]], [[Daman and Diu]]. Sometimes, [[masala chai]] is added on the side. It is a staple on restaurant menus in the beach resorts along India's coasts and also prepared regularly in the home kitchens of the [[Anglo-Indian]] [[Goan]], [[Malayali]], [[Mangalorean]] and [[Parsi]] communities.

===Japan===
Packaged crème caramel is ubiquitous in [[Konbini|Japanese convenience stores]] under the name {{nihongo||プリン|purin}} (i.e., "[[pudding]]"), or ''custard pudding''. The same kind of dessert is sold in convenience stores in [[Taiwan]].

===Malaysia===
[[File:Puding karamel 20230521 172754.jpg|thumb|A slice of ''puding karamel'']]
Caramel custard (locally known as ''puding karamel'' or ''puding karamel kastard'') is a popular dessert in [[Malaysia]].

===Mexico===
[[File:Flan napolitano.png|thumb|''Flan napolitano'' in Mexico]]

Crème caramel is extremely popular in [[Mexico]], being made at home, found pre-made at grocery stores, served in restaurants, and even sold on the streets. A variation of the dish called ''Flan Napolitano'' is made in some parts of Mexico where cream cheese is added to create a creamier consistency, though it is not as popular or widespread. Flan's popularity among Mexican-Americans helped the dish become popular in the United States. Another variation is "Flan de Cajeta", which replaces the standard caramel with cajeta (milk caramel with a base of goat milk).
A popular Mexican dessert involving crème caramel is "chocoflan" (a portmanteau of its constituents), which is a layered [[Bundt cake]]-styled dessert made of chocolate cake and Crème caramel baked in a [[Bain-marie|water bath]]. It also has the nickname "impossible cake" due to how it is prepared: despite the Crème caramel layer making up the top half in the final dessert, the chocolate cake batter is poured in the tin first. Its popularity has spread to other Latin American countries, such as Chile.

===Philippines===
[[File:Leche flan Filipinas.jpg|thumb|[[Philippine]] leche flan are characteristically oval-shaped due to the traditional use of tin molds known as ''llaneras''.]]

In the [[Philippines]], crème caramel is known as "leche flan" (an anglicization of [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]] ''{{Lang|es|flan de leche}}'', literally "milk flan"), which is a heavier version of the Spanish dish, made with condensed milk and more egg yolks.{{cn|date=September 2025}} Leche flan is usually steamed over an open flame or stove top in an oval-shaped tin mold known as ''llanera'' (also spelled ''lyanera'', which is also used to make [[hardinera]]), although rarely it can also be cooked in an oven. Leche flan is a staple dessert in celebratory feasts.

Leche flan is also commonly baked into pastries. The most common is the Filipino dessert [[flan cake]] or leche flan cake, a Filipino [[Chiffon cake|chiffon]] or [[sponge cake]] base ({{lang|fil|[[mamón]]}}) with a layer of leche flan on top. It can similarly be baked into [[steamed]] cupcakes known as ''[[puto mamón]]'', a combination known as ''[[puto flan]]''.{{cn|date=September 2025}}

===Portugal===

It characteristically has a hole in the center.

===Puerto Rico===
Most Puerto Rican flans are based on eggs and milk. Egg white and egg yolks are beaten separately with sugar to achieve a light flan.
