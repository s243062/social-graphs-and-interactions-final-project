'''Sauerbraten''' ({{IPA|de|ˈzaʊ̯ɐˌbʁaːtn̩|pron|audio=De-Sauerbraten.ogg}}) is a traditional German roast of heavily marinated meat. It is regarded as a [[national dish]] of [[Cuisine of Germany|Germany]], and is frequently served in German-style restaurants internationally.<ref>Garrett 1898</ref> It can be cooked from a variety of meats, most often from [[beef]], but also from [[chicken]], [[lamb and mutton]], [[pork]] and [[horse meat|horse]].<ref name="Sheraton 1965, p.147">Sheraton 1965, p. 147.</ref><ref name="Kummer 2007, p. 553">Kummer 2007, p. 553.</ref><ref>Casada 1996, p. 30.</ref> Before cooking, the raw meat is [[marinate]]d for 5 to 15 days in a mixture of wine or vinegar, water, herbs, spices, and seasonings.  Usually, tougher cuts of meat, such as rump roast or bottom round of beef, are used, and the long marinating tenderizes the meat. A Sauerbraten dinner is almost always accompanied by a hearty gravy resulting from its roasting and is most often served with potato pancakes (''[[Kartoffelpuffer]]''),  potato dumplings (''[[Knödel|Kartoffelklöße]]''), or ''[[Spätzle]]''.<ref name="Saekel 2005, F-5">Saekel 2005, F-5.</ref>

Ingredients used in the marinade, and accompaniments served with sauerbraten, vary across regions. Regional variants of the dish include those from [[Baden]], [[Franconia]], [[Thuringia]], [[Rhineland]], [[Saarland]], [[Silesia]], and [[Swabia]].<ref name="Sheraton 1965, p.147"/>

==Etymology==
The name "Sauerbraten" is of German origin, and is derived from ''sauer'' meaning "sour" or "pickled" and ''Braten'' meaning "roast meat", thus "sour roast".<ref>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (4th Ed.). (2006)</ref>

==History==
[[Julius Caesar]] has been assigned a role in the inspiration for sauerbraten as he sent [[amphora]]s filled with beef marinated in wine over the [[Alps]] to the newly founded Roman colony of [[Cologne]]. According to this legend, this inspired the residents of Cologne to imitate the Roman import.<ref name=" Hassani 2004, p.156"/> While quite common, these claims are largely unsubstantiated.

Several sources believe sauerbraten was invented by [[Charlemagne]] in the 9th century AD as a means of using leftover roasted meat.<ref name="Schmidt 2003, p.94"/><ref>Herter 1995.</ref> [[Saint Albertus Magnus]], also known as Saint Albert the Great and Albert of Cologne, is also credited with popularizing the dish in the 13th century.<ref>[http://www.foodreference.com/html/html/april2.html April 2 Today's Events in Food History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2009}}

Horse meat was not originally used for the dish, although it has become commonly used in restaurants in the [[Rhineland]]. Most other areas in which the dish is found currently use beef.<ref name=" Kummer 2007, p. 553"/><ref>Babcock 2002 p. 248.</ref>

==Regional variations==
[[File:Sauerbraten-gebraten.jpg|thumb|Rheinischer Sauerbraten, in which sweetness from raisins balances the sourness and acidity of the marinade]]

There are many regional variants of sauerbraten.  Many of the variations are in the ingredients used for the marinade in which the cut of meat is immersed for several days before cooking.

Generally, the marinade's base is either [[red wine]], vinegar, or a combination of both. While Germany largely produces [[white wine]]s such as [[Riesling]] and [[Gewürztraminer]], regions of Germany that are closer to France often use [[red wine]] as the base for the marinade. [[Wine vinegar]], [[apple cider vinegar]] and other varieties can be used as a base. Recipes from eastern regions of Germany closer to Poland and the Czech Republic tend to use vinegar as the base more frequently. In many regions, wine and vinegar are used together.

* ''Rheinischer Sauerbraten'' is prepared in Germany's [[Rhineland]] region—along the valley of the [[Rhine]]. [[Raisin]]s and sometimes [[sugar beet syrup]] are added in cooking to provide sweetness to complement the sourness of the marinade.<ref name="Hassani 2004, p.156">Hassani 2004, p. 156.</ref>

==Preparation==
===Meat selection===
Sauerbraten can be made with many different kinds of roasting meat.  Tougher, less expensive cuts of meat are used—typically a rump roast or bottom round of beef.

[[Venison]] or other game is often prepared as sauerbraten as the spices and vinegar take away the gamey taste of the meat.<ref name="Schmidt 2003, p.94">Schmidt 2003, p.94.</ref>

===Marination===
[[File:Sauerbraten-mariniert.jpg|thumb|Sauerbraten marinating]]

A solid cut from the bottom [[Round steak|round]]<ref>[[The Culinary Institute of America]] Publisher 2006, p. 178.</ref> or rump is marinated for three or four days,<ref name="Mitchell 1953, p.106">Mitchell 1953, p. 106.</ref> or as many as ten,<ref>Sales 1977, p. 176.</ref> before cooking.

Red wine vinegar and wine typically form the basis of the marinade, which also includes earthy aromatic spices such as [[peppercorns]], [[juniper berries]], [[cloves]], [[nutmeg]], and [[bay leaves]] and less commonly [[coriander]], [[mustard seed]], [[cinnamon]], [[mace (spice)|mace]], [[ginger]], and [[thyme]].<ref name="Kummer 2007, p. 553"/><ref>[http://www.thespicehouse.com/spices/sauerbraten-spice-blend Sauerbraten Blend of Whole Spices<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>Wood 1983, p.95.</ref> The marinade may also include vegetables such as onions, celery, and carrots.<ref name="Mitchell 1953, p.106"/> The acidic marinade helps tenderize the meat before it cooks. [[Buttermilk]] is also used as a marinade in certain regional varieties.<ref name="Saekel 2005, F-5"/><ref>Richards 1966, p. 182.</ref>
It is frequently advised to marinate the meat in an [[earthenware]], glass, plastic, or [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] container rather than one made of bare metal, as the acidic marinade would react with a metal vessel during the extended marinating.

===Cooking===
After the meat is removed from the marinade and dried, it is first browned in oil or lard and then [[braised]] with the strained marinade in a covered dish in a medium oven or on the stovetop. After simmering for four hours or more, depending on the size of the roast, the marinade will continue to flavor the roast and, as the meat cooks, its juices will also be released resulting in a very tender roast.

===Gravy===
After the roast is cooked, the marinade is strained and returned to a saucepan where it is thickened (often with crushed [[gingerbread]], [[lebkuchen]]—in particular [[Aachener Printen]]—or [[gingersnaps]], flour, sour cream, brown sugar, and/or [[roux]])<ref name="Kummer 2007, p. 553"/><ref>Youngkrantz 1997, p. 105.</ref> which add body and flavor to the sauce. Before it closed in 1982, [[Lüchow's]] German restaurant in [[New York City]] used crushed gingersnap cookies to season and thicken the gravy of its sauerbraten, one of the favored dishes.<ref name="Saekel 2005, F-5"/><ref>O'Neill 1992, p. 181.</ref> This style was made popular in the U.S. after the publication of ''Luchow's German Cookbook: The Story and the Favorite Dishes of America's Most Famous German Restaurant'' by Jan Mitchell in 1952.<ref name="Mitchell 1953, p.106"/>

==Other==
Packaged sauerbraten seasonings are available. Cooked sauerbraten in marinade is sold in some supermarkets.

While sauerbraten is most traditionally eaten with beer,<ref>Jackson 1998, p.53.</ref> it pairs well with the following wine varietals: [[burgundy wine|Burgundy]],<ref>Mitchell 1953, p. 107</ref> [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Gewürztraminer]], [[Pinot noir]], [[Riesling]], and [[Syrah]].<ref>[http://www.winedin.com/pair_food_wine.php?food=Sauerbraten Sauerbraten Wine Pairing | Food and Wine Pairings | Pair Food and Wine<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2010}}
