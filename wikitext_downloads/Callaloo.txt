'''Callaloo''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|ae|l|@|'|l|u:}} {{respell|KAL|ə|LOO}},<ref>[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/callaloo "callaloo"] Merriam-Webster's Dictionary on merriam-webster.com</ref> {{IPA|jam|kalalu|lang|link=yes}}; many spelling variants, such as '''kallaloo''', '''calaloo''', '''calalloo''', '''calaloux,''' or '''callalloo''')<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YSEXAQAAMAAJ&q=kalalu+++|title=L.P.L.P.|date=12 October 1990|publisher=University of Texas Press|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v3-LBQAAQBAJ&q=kalalu+++&pg=PA169|title=Sociocultural Dimensions of Language Change|first1=Ben G.|last1=Blount|first2=Mary|last2=Sanches|date=10 May 2014|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9781483277653 |via=Google Books}}</ref>  is a plant used in popular dishes in many Caribbean countries, while for other Caribbean countries, a stew made with the plant is called {{langr|jam|callaloo}}. Cuisines, including the plant {{langr|jam|callaloo}} or dishes called {{langr|jam|callaloo}}, vary throughout the Caribbean. In countries such as Trinidad and Tobago or Grenada, the dish itself is called {{langr|jam|callaloo}} and uses [[taro]] leaves (known by many local names such as 'dasheen bush', '{{langr|jam|callaloo}} bush', or 'bush') or ''[[Xanthosoma]]'' leaves (known by many names, including ''cocoyam'' and ''tannia'').

The native Jamaicans (Arawak and Taino people of America) used {{langr|jam|callaloo}} in their cooking that they passed down. The later farmer immigrants of indentured servitude: indojamaicans brought their variant of {{langr|jam|callaloo}} (''[[Amaranthus viridis]]'') in the late 17-1800s as crops to the island of Jamaica and other Caribbean islands like Trinidad and Africa during apartheid where indentured servants were brought from India. Since the leaf vegetable used in some regions differs, some confusion can arise among the vegetables with the dish itself. This, as is the case with many other Caribbean dishes, is a remnant of West African and [[Taíno|Taino]] cuisine.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kreyol.com/dictionary/Kk.html|title=Kreyol [ Haitian Creole ] Dictionary|website=kreyol.com|access-date=2019-06-20|archive-date=2019-06-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190620001336/https://kreyol.com/dictionary/Kk.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Etymology==
There are two possible etymological origins for the word.

== Cooking variations ==
[[Trinidadians and Tobagonians|Trinbagonians]], Grenadians, and Dominicans  primarily use taro/ dasheen bush for {{langr|jam|callaloo}}, although Dominicans also use [[water spinach]]. [[Jamaicans]], Belizeans, St. Lucians, and Guyanese, on the other hand, use the name {{lang|jam|callaloo}} to refer to an indigenous variation of amaranth, and use it in a plethora of dishes and as a drink ("{{langr|jam|callaloo}} juice").<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Higman |first=B. W. |year=2007 |title=Jamaican Versions of Callaloo |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/30135936 |journal=Callaloo |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=351–368 |doi=10.1353/cal.2007.0137 |jstor=30135936 |s2cid=162307339 |issn=0161-2492|url-access=subscription }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=13 November 2013 |title=Callaloo: more than just iron |url=https://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20131113/health/health1.html |access-date=2023-02-05 |website=jamaica-gleaner.com |language=en}}</ref> The "{{langr|jam|callaloo}}" made in [[Jamaica]] is different from the "{{langr|jam|callaloo}}" made in [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Grenada]], and the rest of the Caribbean in terms of the main ingredient (the leaf used) and other ingredients included.

Jamaicans tend to steam {{langr|jam|callaloo}} leaf with garlic, carrots, local powdered seasoning, tomatoes, salt, Scotch bonnet peppers, onions, scallions, thyme, sweet pepper, pimento, with or without salt fish or other meats and even in rice or their famous patty pastries. Trinidadians and Saint Lucians, however, use dasheen bush, okra, coconut milk, pumpkin, onions, bell peppers, local seasonings, and spices, along with crabs or pigtails.

"Callaloo" in Trinidad is found in a variety of dishes, including {{langr|jam|callaloo}} soup or "[[oil down]]". Callaloo is one of the [[national dishes]] of [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Dominica]], although this soup can be found all around the Caribbean as one of the regional cuisine's "foodie favorites".<ref>{{cite book|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|title=Caribbean Islands|year=2021|page=243|isbn=978-1-78701-673-6}}</ref>

==Callaloo recipes==
[[File:Jamaican callaloo.jpg|thumb|A Jamaican breakfast including {{langr|jam|callaloo}} (bottom right)]]
Callaloo in Trinidad and Tobago and other eastern Caribbean countries is generally made with [[okra]] and dasheen or water spinach ''Ipomoea aquatica''.  There are many variations of {{langr|jam|callaloo}} which may include [[coconut milk]], [[Crab meat|crab]], [[conch]], [[spiny lobster|Caribbean lobster]], meats, pumpkin, [[chili pepper]]s, and other [[seasoning]]s such as chopped onions and garlic. The ingredients are added and simmered down to a somewhat stew-like consistency. When done, {{langr|jam|callaloo}} is dark green in colour and is served as a side dish which may be used as a gravy for other food.

Callaloo is widely known throughout the Caribbean and has a distinctively Caribbean origin, using indigenous (''Xanthosoma'') plants and modified with African influences, such as okra. (See [[palaver sauce]] for the West African dish.) Trinidadians have embraced this dish from their ancestors and over time have added ingredients such as coconut milk to modify its flavour. Callaloo is mostly served as a side dish; for Trinidadians, Bajans, and Grenadians it usually accompanies rice, macaroni pie, and a meat of choice. In Guyana it is made in various ways without okra.

In Jamaica, {{langr|jam|callaloo}} is often combined with [[saltfish]] or other meats, and is usually seasoned with garlic, carrots, local powdered seasoning, tomatoes, salt, scotch bonnet peppers, onions, scallions, thyme, sweet pepper, pimento and steamed. It is often eaten as a side dish with a full course meal, or as either breakfast or dinner with roasted breadfruit, boiled green bananas and dumplings, or bread. It is a popular and versatile dish that is even added to Jamaican patties,<ref>{{Cite news |last=Washington |first=Bryan |date=23 February 2022 |title=The Beef Patty Is Jamaica in the Palm of Your Hand |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/23/magazine/beef-patty-recipe.html |access-date=2023-05-27 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> called vegetable/vegie/vagan patties,<ref>{{Cite web |last=jhanelle.golding |date=18 February 2022 |title=Best Vegan Jamaican Patties Recipe – From The Comfort Of My Bowl |url=https://www.fromthecomfortofmybowl.com/vegan-jamaican-patties-recipe/ |access-date=2023-05-27 |website=fromthecomfortofmybowl.com |language=en-US}}</ref> seasoned rice, as well as Fritters

In Grenada, {{langr|jam|callaloo}} is steamed with garlic, onion and coconut milk and often eaten as a side dish. Grenadians also stir or blend the mixture until it has a smooth consistent texture. Callaloo soup comprising {{langr|jam|callaloo}}, okra (optional), dumplings, ground provision like yam, potato (sweet and "Irish") chicken and beef is traditionally eaten on Saturdays. It is also one of the most important ingredients in [[oil down]], the island's national dish comprising steamed breadfruit, {{langr|jam|callaloo}}, dumplings, ground provision, carrot and several varieties of meat—salt fish, chicken, and pork. All of this is steamed in coconut milk and saffron powder.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Neuman |first1=Scott |title=This Hearty Stew Is A One-Pot Lesson In Grenada's History |department=The Salt |work=[[NPR]] |date=11 September 2016 |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/09/11/493157111/this-hearty-stew-is-a-one-pot-lesson-in-grenadas-history |access-date=5 February 2023}}</ref>

In the Virgin Islands, {{langr|jam|callaloo}} is served with a dish of [[fungee]] on the side.

In Guadeloupe, {{lang|fr|calalou au crabe}} (crab {{langr|jam|callaloo}}) is a traditional Easter dish.

In St. Lucia, crab {{langr|jam|callaloo}} is also popular especially as part of the country's [[Creole peoples|Creole]] day celebrations.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Creole food: The origin of crab callaloo |website=Loop St. Lucia |url=https://stlucia.loopnews.com/content/creole-food-origin-crab-callaloo |access-date=2023-02-05 |language=en}}</ref>

Martinique and Guadeloupe also have a variety served with Creole rice and salt cod salad.<ref name="Davidson-2014" />

A similar variation is the recipe called ''[[Laing (food)|laing]]'' which is popular in the Philippines, mainly the Bicol region.

== In popular culture ==
The Costa Rican [[Calypso music|calypso]] musician [[Walter Ferguson (singer-songwriter)|Walter Ferguson]] has written a song celebrating callaloo’s flavour, popularity, and health effects. <ref>{{Cite web |title=Calypso of Costa Rica: Cocoa Plantation Calypso Songs Sung in English |url=https://folkways.si.edu/walter-ferguson-gavitt/mr-gavitt-calypsos-of-costa-rica/caribbean-world/music/album/smithsonian |access-date=2025-09-06 |website=Smithsonian Folkways Recordings |language=en-US}}</ref>
