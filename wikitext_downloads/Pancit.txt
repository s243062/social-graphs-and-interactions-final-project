The term ''pancit'' (or the [[Filipino language|standardized]] but less common ''pansít'') is derived from either the [[Hokkien in the Philippines|Philippine Hokkien]] terms 扁食 ({{zh|poj=pán-si̍t/pián-si̍t|l=[[Wonton noodles|wonton]] (noodles)}}) or 便的食 ({{zh|poj=piân-ê-si̍t/pân-si̍t|l=convenient food}}).<ref name="pcij">{{Cite web |last=Lumen |first=Nancy Reyes |date=January 2, 2005 |title=Republic of Pancit |url=http://pcij.org/stories/republic-of-pancit/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028140857/http://pcij.org/stories/republic-of-pancit |archive-date=October 28, 2009 |access-date=October 27, 2009 |website=Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism |language=en}}</ref> In the Filipino language, ''pancit'' is the generic word for noodles.<ref name=":0" /> Different kinds of noodles can be found in Filipino supermarkets which can then be cooked at home. Noodle dishes are also standard fare in local restaurants, with establishments specializing in them called ''panciterias'' or ''pancitans''.<ref name="Mercado" />

Pancit has evolved in Filipino cuisine to combine both Chinese and Spanish techniques, as well as use local ingredients. Pancit is most commonly cooked by sautéing (''guisado'' in [[Philippine Spanish]]) them with garlic, onions, vegetables (commonly [[carrot]]s, [[green bean]]s, [[cabbage]], [[bell pepper]]s, [[chayote]], [[bottle gourd]], ''[[luffa|patola]]'', [[oyster mushroom]]s, and [[cauliflower]], among others), and meat (including different kinds of Philippine ''[[longganisa]]s'') or seafood (including shrimp, fish, squid, crab, [[oyster]]s, clams, and [[fish ball]]s). Rarer ingredients include ''[[bilimbi|kamias]]'', [[coconut milk]], [[banana blossom]]s, [[mustard greens]], [[okra]], [[calabaza]], [[cloud ear mushroom|''tengang daga'' mushrooms]], and [[shitake mushroom]]s.<ref name="Mercado" /> The ingredients of the sauce varies by recipe. These ingredients include [[soy sauce]] (or salt), [[vinegar]], fish sauce (''[[patis (sauce)|patis]]''), ''[[bagoong alamang]]'' ([[shrimp paste]]), ''[[taba ng talangka]]'' (crab fat), [[oyster sauce]], [[bugnay wine]], [[fermented soy bean paste]], and various sweet sauces (including ''[[inihaw]]'' sauces).<ref name="Mercado" />

They can also be cooked in a broth or braised. Almost all pancit dishes are also uniquely served with sliced halves of [[calamansi]], meant to be squeezed over the noodles (at the consumer's discretion) as the juice adds a tangy sourness. The most common other garnishings and condiments are flaked smoked fish (''[[tinapa]]''), fried garlic, crumbled pork cracklings (''[[chicharon]]''), [[labuyo chili]]s, [[shallot]]s, ground [[black pepper]], glutinous rice ''[[okoy]]'', ''[[Allium tuberosum|kinchay]]'', [[peanut]]s, and sliced hard-boiled eggs. Some regions may also add sliced [[bilimbi]] fruits (''kamias'').<ref name="Mercado" /><ref name="Davidson">{{Cite book |last=Davidson |first=Alan |title=The Oxford Companion to Food |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-104072-6 |edition=3rd |location=Oxford |page=555 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="pepper" /><ref name="Tee" />

Pancit dishes are generally named after the types of noodles used. The most commonly used noodles are ''canton'' ([[egg noodles]], usually round), ''bihon'' ([[rice vermicelli]]), ''lomi'' (thick egg noodles), ''miki'' (soft yellow egg noodles, usually square in cross-section), ''misua'' or ''miswa'' ([[wheat vermicelli]]), ''palabok'' (yellow cornstarch noodles), ''sotanghon'' ([[glass noodles]]), and ''[[odong]]'' (yellow flour noodles).
