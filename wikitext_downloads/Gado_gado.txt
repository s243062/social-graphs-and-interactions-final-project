In 2018, ''gado-gado'' was promoted as one of five [[national dish]]es of Indonesia; the others are [[Soto (food)|soto]], [[Satay|sate]], [[nasi goreng]], and [[rendang]].<ref name="Kompas.com-Makanan-Nasional">{{Cite news|url=https://travel.kompas.com/read/2018/04/10/171000627/kemenpar-tetapkan-5-makanan-nasional-indonesia-ini-daftarnya|title=Kemenpar Tetapkan 5 Makanan Nasional Indonesia, Ini Daftarnya - Kompas.com|last=Media|first=Kompas Cyber|work=KOMPAS.com|access-date=2018-04-18|language=id}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The term ''gado'' or the verb ''menggado'' means to consume something without rice. In Indonesian Betawi, ''digado'' or ''menggado''<ref>{{cite web | url=https://id.wiktionary.org/wiki/menggado | title=Menggado | date=19 July 2012 }}</ref> means to eat a certain dish (be it fish, meat, chicken, etc.) without rice. ''Gado-gado'' is made up of a rich mixture of vegetables, including [[potatoes]], [[string beans|longbeans]], [[bean sprouts]], [[spinach]], [[chayote]], [[bitter gourd]], [[corn]] and [[cabbage]], along with [[tofu]], [[tempeh]], and hard-boiled eggs. They are all mixed in peanut sauce dressing, sometimes also topped with ''[[krupuk]]'' and sprinkles of fried [[shallot]]s. ''Gado-gado'' is different from Sundanese ''[[Lotek (food)|lotek]] atah'' or ''[[karedok]]'' as the latter uses only raw vegetables. Another similar dish is the Javanese ''[[pecel]]''.

==Region==
''Gado-gado'' is widely sold in almost every part of [[Indonesia]], each with its own regional variations.<ref name="Balidaily"/> It is thought to have originally been a [[Sundanese cuisine|Sundanese]] dish, as it is most prevalent in Western parts of [[Java]] (which includes [[Jakarta]], [[Banten]], and [[West Java]] provinces). The [[Javanese cuisine|Javanese]] have their own slightly similar version of a vegetables-in-peanut-sauce dish called ''[[pecel]]'' which is more prevalent in Central and East Java. ''Gado-gado'' is widely available at hawkers' carts, stalls (''[[warung]]'') and restaurants and hotels throughout [[Indonesia]]; it is also served in Indonesian-style restaurants worldwide. Though it is customarily called a salad, the peanut sauce is a larger component of ''gado-gado'' than is usual for the dressings in Western-style salads; the vegetables should be well coated with it.

Some eating establishments use different mixtures of peanut sauce, or add other ingredients for taste such as [[cashew nut]]s. In Jakarta, several eating establishments boast ''gado-gado'' as their signature dish, some of which have been in business for decades and have developed faithful clientele. For example, Gado-Gado Boplo restaurant chain has been around since 1970,<ref>{{cite web |title =Gado-Gado Boplo |url =http://www.boplo.net/profile.html |language =id |access-date =12 May 2015 |archive-date =9 April 2015 |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150409073730/http://boplo.net/profile.html |url-status =dead }}</ref> while Gado-Gado Bonbin in Cikini has been around since 1960.<ref>{{cite web|title =Enjoying Jakarta through culinary nostalgia | author =Triwik Kurniasari and Maulina Sartika Pravitasari | date =15 August 2008 | url =http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/08/15/enjoying-jakarta-through-culinary-nostalgia.html |access-date =12 May 2015}}</ref>

The peanut sauce is made of ground fried peanuts, sweet palm sugar, garlic, chilies, salt, tamarind, and a squeeze of lime.<ref name="Balidaily"/> ''Gado-gado'' is generally freshly made, sometimes in front of the customers to suit their preferred degree of spiciness, which corresponds to the amount of [[chili pepper]] included. However, particularly in the West, ''gado-gado'' sauce is often prepared ahead of time and in bulk. ''Gado-gado'' sauce is also available in dried form, which is simply rehydrated by adding hot water.

''Gado-gado'' sauce is not to be confused with [[satay]] sauce, which is also a peanut sauce.

== History ==
The history of this Indonesian culinary dish does not have a fixed historical background. Rather, there are several different theories and beliefs as to how ''gado-gado'' became an Indonesian culinary dish. The different theories and beliefs are written below:

=== Indonesian word ''"digado"'' ===
Gado-gado comes from the Indonesian word ''"digado''". However, the word ''"digado''" does not exist in the Indonesian dictionary. The word ''"digado''" originates from a specific Indonesian culture, [[Betawi people|Betawi]]. In the [[Betawi language]], the word means “to not be eaten with rice”, which is why rice is not included as one of the key ingredients of ''gado-gado''. Rather, a substitute of rice is used, which is known as ''[[lontong]]'', otherwise known as Indonesian rice cake.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Story|first=Ayana|date=20 June 2019|title=Fakta Gado-gado, Kuliner Khas Betawi dengan Asal Usul yang Misterius|url=https://www.idntimes.com/food/dining-guide/maria-liana/fakta-gado-gado-kuliner-khas-betawi-exp-c1c2/5|access-date=27 November 2020|website=[[idntimes]]}}</ref>

=== Tugu village ===
Another theory is that ''gado-gado'' originated from the Tugu village. In the early 1700s, when the Europeans arrived in Indonesia, a number of Portuguese people started a village currently known as the Tugu village. It is said that these Portuguese people brought their local cuisine to Indonesia. Through the introduction of the [[Culture of Portugal|Portuguese culture]], the dish ''gado-gado'' was first introduced to Indonesia.<ref name=":0" />

=== Chinese origin ===
There are also some who claim that ''gado-gado'' originated from the [[Chinese people]] living in [[Betawi people|Betawi]]. Some claim that the Chinese people really enjoyed the Javanese ''[[pecel]]'', which is an Indonesian salad, and wanted to modify the dish to better accommodate their taste. As a result, the dish ''gado-gado'' was created.<ref name=":0" />

== Variations ==
=== ''Gado-gado Betawi'' ===
This variation of ''gado-gado'' originates from [[Betawi people|Betawi]] in Jakarta and is known for being prepared differently as compared to the other variations.<ref name=":1" /> Based on a recipe book "Resep Gado-Gado Betawi" by Sasongko Iswandaru [https://www.kompas.com/food/read/2022/06/17/210400175/resep-gado-gado-betawi-lengkap-dengan-bumbu-kacang?page=all], the dish consists of boiled vegetables, including long bean, bean sprout and cabbage, mixed with fried tofu, tempeh and boiled egg, served with peanut sauce.

=== ''Gado-gado Padang'' ===
Unlike ''gado-gado sederhana'', ''gado-gado'' [[Padang]] adds yellow noodles and ''[[Sohun food|sohun]]'', which are cellophane noodles, to the ''gado-gado'' dish.<ref name=":1" /> This variation of ''gado-gado'' originated from [[Padang]] in [[West Sumatra]].<ref name=":1" /> It is also known to have a spicy flavor.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|last=Alva|first=Apriani|date=20 December 2016|title=Kuliner Nusantara - Ini 5 Macam Gado-gado dari Penjuru Indonesia, Pernah Coba Nomor 5?|url=https://travel.tribunnews.com/2016/12/20/kuliner-nusantara-ini-5-macam-gado-gado-dari-penjuru-indonesia-pernah-coba-nomor-5|access-date=27 November 2020|website=[[tribunnews]]}}</ref> This variation follows other common dishes in [[Padang]], which are known for having a spicy flavor.<ref name=":2" />

=== ''Gado-gado Sederhana'' ===
A translation of “''gado-gado sederhana''” is “simple ''gado-gado''”. This variation is the basic way of preparing a ''gado-gado'' dish, which is made using vegetables, bean sprouts, ''[[lontong]]'' and peanut sauce as key ingredients.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Shidqiyyah|first=Septika|date=17 November 2018|title=4 Cara Membuat Gado Gado, dari yang Sederhana, Gado Gado Betawi, Gado Gado Padang hingga Surabaya|url=https://www.liputan6.com/lifestyle/read/3693869/4-cara-membuat-gado-gado-dari-yang-sederhana-gado-gado-betawi-gado-gado-padang-hingga-surabaya#:~:text=Liputan6.com%2C%20Jakarta%20Gado%20gado,%2C%20bayam%2C%20dan%20lain%20sebagainya|access-date=27 November 2020|website=[[liputan6]]}}</ref>

=== ''Gado-gado Sidoarjo'' ===
This variation of ''gado-gado'' originated from [[Sidoarjo Regency|Sidoarjo]] and is created using an addition of ''[[Shrimp paste|petis]]'', which is a food additive added to the peanut sauce.<ref name=":2" />

=== ''Gado-gado Surabaya'' ===
This variation of ''gado-gado'' cooks the peanut sauce and spreads it over the dish.<ref name=":1" /> Some claim that cooking the peanut sauce makes the dish last longer.<ref name=":1" /> It uses lettuce and tomatoes as some of the ingredients of the dish.<ref name=":2" /> It also uses coconut milk in the peanut sauce, which is used to make the sauce look oilier and more tasteful.<ref name=":2" />

== Ingredients ==

=== Peanut dressing ===
[[Image:Gado-Gado stall.JPG|thumb|right|Gado-gado stall displaying ingredients of the dish.]]
Most of flavours in ''gado-gado'' are acquired from the mixture of its ''bumbu kacang'' or peanut salad dressing. ''Gado-gado'' combines  slightly sweet, spicy and savory tastes.<ref name="Balidaily"/> The common primary ingredients of the peanut sauce are as follows:

* ground fried [[peanut]]s ([[kidney bean]]s may be substituted for a richer taste)
* [[coconut sugar]]/[[palm sugar]] (substitute [[brown sugar]] if unavailable)
* [[Chili pepper|chillies]] (according to preference and desired degree of spiciness)
* ''[[terasi]]'' (dried ''shrimp paste'')
* [[Edible salt|salt]]
* [[tamarind]] juice
* [[lime juice]]
* water to dilute

The traditional method of making ''gado-gado'' is to use the ''cobek'' ([[mortar and pestle|pestle]]) and ''ulekan'' or flat rounded stone. The dry ingredients are ground first, then the tamarind liquids are added to achieve the desired consistency.

=== Vegetables ===
[[Image:Gado gado ulek.jpg|thumb|right|A traditional Indonesian way of making ''gado-gado''.]]
The composition of the vegetable salad varies greatly, but usually comprises a mixture of some of the following:
* [[blanching (cooking)|blanched]] - shredded, chopped, or sliced green vegetables such as [[cabbage]], [[Ipomoea aquatica|kangkung]], [[spinach]], [[bean sprout]]s, boiled young [[jackfruit]], [[chayote]], [[Green bean|string bean]], [[green bean]], [[bitter melon]], and [[Maize|corn]]. 
* sliced - boiled [[potatoes]]
* uncooked - sliced [[cucumber]], [[tomato]], and [[lettuce]].
* peeled and sliced boiled [[egg (food)|egg]]s
* sliced - fried [[tofu]] and [[tempeh]]
Outside Indonesia, it is usual to improvise with whatever vegetables are available.
All the ingredients are blanched or lightly boiled, including vegetables, potatoes and bean sprouts, except for the tempeh and tofu, which are fried, and cucumber which is sliced and served fresh.<ref name="Balidaily"/> The blanched vegetables and other ingredients are mixed well with the dressing.

=== Garnishes and rice===
In Indonesia ''gado-gado'' is commonly served mixed with chopped ''[[lontong]]'' or ''[[ketupat]]'' (glutinous rice cake), or with [[steamed rice]] served separately.  It is nearly always served with ''[[krupuk]]'', [[tapioca]] crackers, or ''[[emping]]'', Indonesian-style fried crackers made from ''[[melinjo]]''. A common garnish is ''bawang goreng'', a sprinkle of finely-chopped fried [[shallot]].<ref name="Balidaily"/>

== Serving ==
There are three common ways of serving the ''gado-gado'' dish in Indonesia. Firstly, ''gado-gado'' is sometimes prepared at home as a traditional Indonesian dish. It is relatively easy to prepare and cook, which is part of the reason why ''gado-gado'' can be commonly found in Indonesian households. Secondly, some street vendors and ''[[warung]]s'' in Indonesia are known to sell ''gado-gado''. However, different cities may serve different variations of ''gado-gado'' depending on the region. Thirdly, ''gado-gado'' can also be found in restaurants that serve Indonesian cuisine. Amongst many Indonesian restaurants, ''gado-gado'' is a relatively common dish, because it is popular in Indonesia.
