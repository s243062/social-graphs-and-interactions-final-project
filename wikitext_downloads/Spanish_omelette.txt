== History ==
[[File:MoskukoJaiak 16ago2015 01 (20656939755).jpg|thumb|upright|Tortilla competition in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] in Northern Spain]]

The first reference to the tortilla in Spanish is found in a [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarrese]] document, as an anonymous "mousehole memorial" addressed to the court of Navarre in 1817. It explains the sparse conditions of Navarre's farmers in contrast with those in [[Pamplona]] (the capital) and La Ribera (in southern Navarre). After listing the sparse food eaten by highlanders, the next quote follows: "…two to three eggs in tortilla for 5 or 6 [people] as our women know how to make it big and thick with fewer eggs, mixing potatoes, breadcrumbs or whatever."<ref>(Spanish) Los "memoriales de ratonera" eran escritos que cualquier ciudadano navarro podía depositar en un buzón ("ratonera") cuando se reunían las Cortes; véase José María Iribarren: "El comer, el vestir y la vida de los navarros de 1817, a través de un 'memorial de ratonera'", in ''Príncipe de Viana'' vol. 17 no. 65 (1956), pp. 473-486.</ref>

According to legend, during the siege of [[Bilbao]], [[Carlist]] General [[Tomás de Zumalacárregui]] invented the {{lang|es|tortilla de patatas}} as an easy, fast and nutritious dish to satisfy the scarcities of the Carlist army. Although it remains unknown whether this is true, it appears the tortilla started to spread during the early [[Carlist Wars]].<ref>Jack, Albert (2010). What Caesar Did For My Salad: The Secret Meanings of our Favorite Dishes. Penguin. p. 368. {{ISBN|9780141929927}}</ref>

Another tale is that the recipe was learnt by Spanish prisoners captured after the [[Battle of Montes Claros]] during the [[Portuguese Restoration War]] in 1665.<ref>Tuell, Marcus (1952). History of War in the Iberian Peninsula. Baltimore: William & Wilkins Publishing House. pp. 242–244</ref> After the Portuguese victory, more than 6,000 Spanish soldiers were kept in captivity for 3 years until the [[Treaty of Lisbon (1668)|1668 Treaty of Lisbon]] was signed. Upon their release, these prisoners brought part of the culture of [[Alentejo]] to Spain, including many recipes, which featured a potato egg pie that evolved into the modern version of “tortilla”.<ref>White, L. (2007). Strategic Geography and the Spanish Habsburg Monarchy's Failure to Recover Portugal, 1640-1668. The Journal of Military History, 71(2), 373-409.  {{JSTOR|413827}}</ref>

As the dish has gained international popularity, and perhaps to distinguish it from the [[Tortilla|thin flatbread made out of wheat or maize]] popular in Mexico and Central America, the {{lang|es|española}} or 'Spanish' naming gained traction.

The preparation is also known by other names in the [[languages of Spain]]{{snd}}{{langx|an|tortiella de trunfas}}; {{langx|ast|tortiella de pataques}}; {{langx|eu|patata-arrautzopil}}; {{langx|ca|truita de patates}}/{{lang|ca|pataques}}; {{langx|gl|tortilla de patacas}}.

==Consumption and traditional recipe==
The Spanish omelette is widely available in Spain, and prepared in some [[Spanish-speaking countries]].

The two main options are either with or without [[onion]]. The addition of onion is the cause of an unresolved dispute, pitting {{lang|es|concebollistas}} (the 'with onion' group) against {{lang|es|sincebollistas}} (the 'without onion' group, considering this to be authentic).{{Sfn|Reyes Baztán|2021|p=166}} It may be related to the tenderness of the local varieties of potato. [[Restaurateur]]s are expected to say whether their tortilla has onion, and industrial producers market both options.

[[File:Tortilla de patata típica de Betanzos.jpg|thumb|upright|The runny "[[Betanzos]]" omelette, originally from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. They are normally made without [[onion]], and rely heavily on the careful cooking of the potato.<ref>[https://www.20minutos.es/noticia/4405928/0/poco-hecha-y-sin-cebolla-es-la-tortilla-de-betanzos-la-mejor-del-mundo/ 20Minutos, "Poco hecha y sin cebolla, ¿es la tortilla de Betanzos la mejor del mundo?" - 5 octubre 2020]</ref>]]

The most common way to cook a Spanish omelette is as follows:

* The [[potato]]es, ideally a starchy variety, are cut into thin slices or small dice. 
* Among Spanish potato crops, one of the most highly regarded varieties is the [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] potato. Its texture and flavor make it unique. In Galicia, locally grown potatoes, especially the Kennebec variety with a firm texture and balanced starch, are considered ideal for Spanish omelets. They are sometimes prepared with Galician chorizo as a regional variation.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Spanish Omelette Recipe |url=https://cookpad.com/eng/recipes/13215496 |access-date=10 November 2025 |website=Cookpad}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Montouto Graña |first=Mónica |date=2021 |title=highlighting the Kennebec potato’s ideal texture and starch balance for Spanish omelets. |newspaper=Campo Galego}}</ref> 
* They are then [[Seasoning|seasoned]] and gently [[simmered]] (not fried) in [[vegetable oil]], traditionally [[olive oil]], with sliced [[onion]]s added at this stage if used. These ingredients are stirred at a moderate temperature until they are soft but not brown.
* The potatoes, and onions, if included, are then drained and mixed with whisked [[Egg as food|eggs]].
* This mixture is then returned to the pan and slowly cooked.<ref name="beeb" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.palacios.es/para-ti/recetas-para-cocinar/trucos-para-preparar-una-deliciosa-tortilla-de-patata |title=Trucos para Preparar una Deliciosa Tortilla de Patatas | trans-title=Tricks for making a delicious potato tortilla|newspaper=Palacios.es |language=es|access-date= 10 January 2016}} A typical recipe</ref>
* A trick to prevent the [[Eggs as food|egg]] from curdling is to let the [[potato]] cool after frying it. This way it won't mix while hot and the egg won't curdle before it reaches the pan. 
* Once the eggs are cooked on one side, the omelette is turned over to cook the other side, often using a plate placed over the mixture so the pan can be inverted.<ref name="Cloake"/>

The omelette may be eaten hot, at room temperature, or chilled; it is commonly served, cut into bite-size pieces ({{lang|es|pincho de tortilla}}), as a ''[[Tapas|tapa]]'', or cut into wedges.


== Tortilla Day ==
{{lang|es|[[:es:Día_de_la_Tortilla|Día de la Tortilla]]}} ('Tortilla Day') is a popular festivity celebrated in many towns in southern and western Spain. Its date varies depending on the town; however, it normally coincides with the Thursday before Lent, the first day of [[Carnival]], also known as {{lang|es|[[Jueves lardero]]}} ([[Fat Thursday]]). Many towns in eastern Spain have a similar celebration on that day. Traditionally, the inhabitants of each town go to a nearby rural area where they spend the day among family members and friends, eating Spanish tortillas and other foods, and playing games.<ref>{{cite web |author=Teresa |date=9 March 2022 |title=Origen del Día de la Tortilla |url=https://sobrehistoria.com/origen-del-dia-de-la-tortilla/ |website=Sobrehistoria.com}}</ref>
