== Etymology ==
In [[Thai language|Thai]], the term ''tom yum kung'' is a compound word of ''tom yum'' + ''kung''. The term ''tom yum'', which means spicy and sour soup,<ref>Senawong, Pornpimol. (2006). ''Ruang Thai-Ties: Social Customs and Cultural Traits that tie all Thais together''. Bangkok: Faculty of Archaeology, Silpakorn University. p. 84. {{ISBN|978-974-6-41147-9}}</ref> is a combination of two [[Proto-Tai language|Proto-Tai]] words: ''*tom'' 'v. to cook in water, boil' + ''*yum'', ''*yam'' 'v. to mix together or n. salad.'<ref>Luo, Yongxian.

* ''Ibid.'' p. 25 :— "Thailand is where ''[[Tom Yum]]'' comes from. "''Tom yam''" is a combination of two Thai words. ''Tom'' alludes to the process of boiling, while ''yam'' means "mixed".
