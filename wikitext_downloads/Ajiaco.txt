The dish is especially popular in the Colombian capital, [[Bogotá]], being called ajiaco santafereño, where it is typically made with chicken, three varieties of [[potatoes]], and the herb ''[[Galinsoga parviflora]]'', known locally as ''guasca'' or ''guascas''.

==History==

Cuban ethnologist [[Fernando Ortiz Fernández|Fernando Ortiz]] stated that ajiaco was a meal typical of the Taíno, and was an appropriate metaphor for Cuba being a [[melting pot]].<ref>Fernando Ortiz, "Los factores humanos de la cubanidad," in ''Etnia y sociedad'', ed.
