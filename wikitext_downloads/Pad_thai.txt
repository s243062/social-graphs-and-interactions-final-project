Pad Thai was originally called "kuai tiao pad Thai" but this was later shortened to simply Pad Thai.<ref>{{cite web |last=admin |date=2020-09-19 |title=Pad Thai: From Foreigner-cum-resident to the Thai Roots |url=https://www.thailandnow.in.th/arts-culture/pad-thai-from-foreigner-cum-resident-to-the-thai-root/ |access-date=2024-04-22 |website=Thailand NOW |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=2018-07-13 |title=The History of Pad Thai |url=https://asianinspirations.com.au/food-knowledge/the-history-of-pad-thai/ |access-date=2024-04-22 |website=Asian Inspirations |language=en-AU}}</ref> ''Kuai tiao'' ({{lang|th|ก๋วยเตี๋ยว}}) is a Thai borrowing of the [[Teochew Min|Teochew]] word ''guê<sup>2</sup> diao<sup>5</sup>'' ({{lang|zh|[[wikt:粿條|粿條]]}}), a type of thick Chinese [[rice noodle]] also known as ''[[shahe fen]]''. The word ''kuai tiao'' has cognates in several other Southeast Asian countries where Chinese immigrants settled; with ''[[kuyteav]]'' in [[Cambodia]], ''[[hủ tiếu]]'' in Vietnam, and ''[[kway teow]]'' in Malaysia and Singapore being analogues.<ref>{{cite web |last=Terei-Vigh |first=Kriszti |date=July 2018 |title=Kuy teav |url=https://www.196flavors.com/cambodia-kuy-teav/ |access-date=15 January 2021 |website=196 flavors}}</ref> 

Although stir-fried rice noodles were introduced to Thailand from [[China]] centuries ago, the dish ''pad Thai'' was invented in the mid-20th century.<ref>{{cite web |date=2015-04-28 |title=The Truth About Pad Thai |url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20150415-the-quest-for-the-perfect-pad-thai |work=BBC}}</ref> The commonly held explanation of Pad Thai's provenance is that during [[World War II]], Thailand suffered a rice shortage due to the war and floods. To reduce domestic rice consumption, the [[Government of Thailand|Thai government]] under Prime Minister [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] promoted consumption of noodles instead.<ref name="Nation-20180513">{{cite news |last1=Pungkanon |first1=Kupluthai |date=13 May 2018 |title=All wrapped up and ready to go |url=https://www.nationthailand.com/life/30345187 |access-date=13 May 2018 |work=The Nation}}</ref> His government promoted rice noodles and helped to establish the [[Thai cultural mandates|modern identity of Thailand]].<ref name="obscura" /> As a result, a new noodle called ''sen chan pad Thai'' (named after [[Chanthaburi Province]]) was created. Pad Thai has since become one of [[Thailand]]'s [[national dish]]es.<ref>{{cite web |author=Tapia, Semina |date=2011-08-15 |title=Thai National Foods |url=http://www.ifood.tv/blog/thai-national-foods |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605004853/http://www.ifood.tv/blog/thai-national-foods |archive-date=2013-06-05 |access-date=2013-02-23 |publisher=Ifood.tv}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=dgbrittany |date=2020-10-12 |title=The History of Pad Thai: How the Amazing Dish Came to Be |url=https://thaiginger.com/the-history-of-pad-thai-how-the-amazing-dish-came-to-be/ |access-date=2023-03-01 |website=Thai Ginger |language=en-US}}</ref>

The dish was created because Thailand was focused on nation-building.<ref name="obscura" /> So this dish was created using rice noodles and it was called Pad Thai as a way to galvanize [[Thaification|nationalism]]."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Belle |first1=Rachel |date=16 July 2019 |title=Why there are so many Thai restaurants in Seattle |url=https://mynorthwest.com/1452089/thai-restaurants-seattle/ |access-date=17 July 2019 |website=My Northwest |publisher=KIRO Radio}}</ref>

Another explanation by Thai-American food writer [[Kasma Loha-unchit]] suggests that pad Thai was invented by the [[Thai Chinese|Thai Chinese immigrants]], because "for a dish to be so named in its own country clearly suggests an origin that isn't Thai".<ref>{{cite web |last=Quartz |first=Roberto A. Ferdman |date=2014-04-17 |title=The Non-Thai Origins of Pad Thai |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/04/non-thai-origins-of-pad-thai/360751/ |access-date=2022-04-12 |website=The Atlantic}}</ref> Noodle cookery in most Southeast Asian countries was introduced by the wave of immigrants from southern China settling in the region the past century. Loha-unchit states that the [[Thai Chinese|ethnic Chinese of Thailand]] were aware that "Central Thai people were very fond of the combination of hot, sour, sweet and salty flavors, they added these to their stir-fried noodle dishes and gave it a fusion name, much like Western chefs today are naming their dishes Thai this or Thai that on their East-West menus."<ref>{{cite web |title=Pad Thai Recipe |url=http://www.thaifoodandtravel.com/recipes/pad-thai-recipe.html |access-date=2022-04-12 |website=www.thaifoodandtravel.com}}</ref> 

At least as early as 2001, the Thai government used pad Thai as a form of "[[soft power]]",<ref>{{cite web |last=Kelley |first=Ryan |title=What Is Sportswashing (and Does It Work)? |url=https://freakonomics.com/podcast/what-is-sportswashing-and-does-it-work/ |access-date=2022-06-27 |website=Freakonomics}}</ref> creating "the Global Thai Restaurant Company, Ltd., in an effort to establish at least 3,000 Thai restaurants worldwide."<ref name=":0">{{cite web |title=The Surprising Reason that There Are So Many Thai Restaurants in America |url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-surprising-reason-that-there-are-so-many-thai-restaurants-in-america/ |access-date=2022-06-27 |website=Vice.com |date=29 March 2018}}</ref> The plan included numerous government agencies and resulted in nearly tripling the number of Thai restaurants globally in seventeen years.<ref name=":0" />
