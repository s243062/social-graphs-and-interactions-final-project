'''''Tanghulu''''',{{Efn|{{IPAc-en|t|ɑː|ŋ|ˈ|h|uː|l|uː|audio=en-us-tanghulu.oga}}}} '''''tang hulu''''',{{Efn|{{zh|s=糖葫芦|t=糖葫蘆|first=t|p=táng húlu|l=sugar calabash}}}} or '''''bingtang hulu'''''{{Efn|{{zh|s=冰糖葫芦|t=冰糖葫蘆|first=t|p=bīngtáng húlu|l=rock-sugar calabash|labels=no}}}} is a traditional [[China|Chinese]] snack consisting of several [[malt sugar]] coated fruits of Chinese hawthorn (''[[Crataegus pinnatifida]]'') on a [[bamboo]] [[skewer]]. It is typically made by skewering hawthorn fruits and coating them in heated sugar syrup, which hardens in the cold. It is named for its [[calabash]]-like shape. Tanghulu is called ''tangdun'er'' ({{Lang|zh|糖墩儿}}) in [[Tianjin]], ''tangqiu'' ({{Lang|zh|糖球}}) in [[Fengyang County|Fengyang]], [[Anhui]], and ''tangzhan'er'' ({{Lang|zh|糖蘸儿}}) in [[Shandong]]. Tanghulu is often mistaken for regular candied fruits{{Citation needed|date=September 2025}}; however, it is coated in a hardened sugar syrup. Tanghulu has been made since the [[Song dynasty]] and remains popular throughout northern China.<ref name="Ph.D.Roufs2014">{{cite book|author1=Timothy G.

[[Chinese haw]] is the traditional fruit used,<ref name="Brachfeld2015">{{cite book|author=Mary Choate and Aaron Brachfeld|title=At Home in Nature, a user's guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J2I-5QnTAeoC&pg=PA315|date=31 August 2015|publisher=Coastalfields Press|pages=315|id=GGKEY:K5213DDZJD2|access-date=10 August 2018|archive-date=8 August 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240808123252/https://books.google.com/books?id=J2I-5QnTAeoC&pg=PA315#v=onepage&q&f=false|url-status=live}}</ref> though in ancient times other fruits were also used. In records from the Qing dynasty, [[grape]]s and [[walnut]]s were added. The pits and seeds of the hawthorn are emptied and are commonly filled with [[Red bean paste|sweet red bean paste]] before being skewered and dipped. In modern times, fruit choices have become more diverse, such as [[cherry tomato]]es, [[mandarin orange]]s, [[strawberry|strawberries]], [[blueberry|blueberries]], [[pineapple]]s, [[kiwifruit]], and [[banana]]s.

== Origin ==
Tanghulu is traditionally a Northern Chinese dessert which was prominently famous in [[Beijing]], according to numerous [[Qing dynasty]] accounts.{{Citation needed|date=October 2024}} Folklore attributes its origin to the [[Song dynasty|Southern Song dynasty]], when the emperor [[Emperor Guangzong of Song|Song Guangzong]] ({{Lang|zh|宋光宗}}) had a beloved imperial concubine named Huang Guifei. One day, when Huang was sick, she refused to eat or drink all day long, and she seemed about to die at any moment. Palace doctors were puzzled as to how to cure her, resulting in Song Guangzong spending an exorbitant amount of money seeking medical help.<ref>{{Cite web |title=冰糖葫芦不平凡的来历：从宫廷美食到常见小吃 |url=http://hlj.ifeng.com/culture/history/detail_2015_03/16/3661336_0.shtml |access-date=2023-02-10 |website=hlj.ifeng.com |archive-date=2023-02-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230210050835/http://hlj.ifeng.com/culture/history/detail_2015_03/16/3661336_0.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref> Later, a doctor came to the palace and treated Huang. He ordered cooks to prepare the hawthorn with rock sugar, advising Huang to take five to ten of them before each meal. Surprisingly, after a few days, Huang gradually recovered. Everyone thought this method was quite novel, so the prescription was passed down. Later, people began to string the fruit together and sell it on the street.<ref>{{Cite web |last=美食玉馔 |date=1970-01-01 |title=酸甜可口的冰糖葫芦，起源于宋朝皇妃的"富贵病" |url=http://k.sina.cn/article_6024824038_1671b84e6001002dv8.html?from=food |access-date=2023-02-10 |website=k.sina.cn |archive-date=2023-02-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230210052355/https://k.sina.cn/article_6024824038_1671b84e6001002dv8.html?from=food |url-status=live }}</ref> Modern tanghulu is still prepared in the same way, but is skewered on bamboo.

== Nutrition ==
Depending on the fruit used,{{Which|date=October 2024}} tanghulu can be rich in [[vitamin C]], [[pectin]] and [[chlorogenic acid]], [[caffeic acid]], [[maslinic acid]], [[oleanolic acid]], [[quercetin]], [[ursolic acid]], [[chrysin]], epicatechin and other [[organic acid]]s and nutritional elements.{{Citation needed|date=October 2024}} Chinese Hawthorn may have medicinal effects, such as reducing the effects of constipation and [[dysentery]]{{Citation needed|reason=Dysentery is usually caused by Shigella bacteria or Entamoeba histolytica amoeba through contaminated water; I'm not sure there's enough evidence to say that hawthorn can stop dysentery|date=July 2023}} and lowering [[blood lipids]] and [[cholesterol]], and its medicinal properties have been widely asserted in Chinese Medicine books. However, due to its high sugar content, long-term consumption may be unsuitable for people with diabetes or  other health conditions.<ref>{{Cite web |last=华龙网 |date=2018-01-30 |title=冰糖葫芦营养价值大科普 |url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2018-01-30/doc-ifyqyesy4291786.shtml |access-date=2023-02-10 |website=news.sina.com.cn |archive-date=2023-02-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230210050833/http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2018-01-30/doc-ifyqyesy4291786.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref>

Each skewer is reported to contain about 20 to 30 grams of sugar, which is close to the recommended daily sugar intake.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-03-03 |title=Sugar: the facts |url=https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-types/how-does-sugar-in-our-diet-affect-our-health/ |access-date=2024-10-24 |website=nhs.uk |language=en}}</ref> High amounts of sugar can cause [[diabetes]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Is Tanghulu Bad For You? - Here Is Your Answer. |url=https://www.isitbadforyou.com/questions/is-tanghulu-bad-for-you |access-date=2024-08-30 |website=www.isitbadforyou.com |language=en-us}}</ref>

== South Korea craze ==
[[File:Bingtanghulu.JPG|thumb|Strawberry ''bingtang hulu'']]

In [[Incheon]] and other areas with a high Chinese population, shops selling tanghulu have existed in the country since the early 2000s. In early 2023, tanghulu went [[Viral video|viral]] on YouTube Shorts and [[TikTok]] in [[South Korea]]. Although the origin of the trend is uncertain, some people{{Who|date=October 2024}} on the Internet attribute it to Miniyu, a Korean [[ASMR]] [[YouTuber]]. [[Generation Z|Gen Z]] and [[millennials]] were the primary audiences seen lining up for the dessert.<ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIPkptwG3ic |title=강남 압구정 로데오도 굴복시킨 탕후루. 밤8시30분 로데오상권 웨이팅 1등 #창업아이템 |date=2023-09-09 |last=창업의신 |access-date=2024-10-24 |via=YouTube}}</ref> It garnered 210,000 tags on [[Instagram]].{{When|date=October 2024}} The number of stores in South Korea increased from 50 to 300 stores within the span of six months.{{Citation needed|date=October 2024}} Its popularity has been attributed to high [[population density]] in metropolitan areas of South Korea where tanghulu may be sold, and the ease at which it is able to be made by businesses or at home.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cao |first=Steffi |date=2024-03-15 |title=All About Tanghulu, the Colorful (and Controversial) Snack Beloved By TikTok |url=https://www.bonappetit.com/story/tanghulu-chinese-street-snack |access-date=2024-10-24 |website=Bon Appétit |language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Problems ===
In 2023, a senator from the [[Democratic Party (South Korea, 2015)|Democratic Party of Korea]] summoned the president of Wangga Tanghulu, one of the leading brands of tanghulu, during a national inspection over the issue of extreme sugar intake and diabetes among children and youth, which had increased 20% just within two years.<ref>{{Cite web |title=소아당뇨 염려에...'왕가탕후루' 대표 국감 간다 |url=https://news.nate.com/view/20230924n19273 |access-date=2024-08-30 |website=네이트 뉴스 |language=ko}}</ref>

Tanghulu skewers and paper cups are often found [[Litter|littered]] on the streets of South Korea. Even when disposed of properly, skewers pierce garbage bags. Businesses, such as internet cafes, [[noraebang]]s, and restaurants, have been seen to display "No Tanghulu Zone"<ref>{{Cite web |title=끈적이고 벌레 꼬이고...쓰레기 몸살에 '노 탕후루존' 등장 |url=https://news.nate.com/view/20230822n10124 |access-date=2024-08-30 |website=네이트 뉴스 |language=ko}}</ref> signs, banning people from eating or bringing tanghulu into their establishment due to litter. 

Demand declined in 2024 due to [[Gartner hype cycle|changing trends]]. As the season changed to winter, people started to prefer warm desserts, such as [[bungeo-ppang]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2024}} The Ministry of the Interior and Safety reported that 76 tanghulu stores closed in early May, higher than the number of stores closed at the same time last year.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Min |first=Young-bin |last2=Yeom |first2=Hyun-a |date=2024-05-12 |title=South Korea's Tanghulu craze fades, 17 franchisees sigh over decline |url=https://www.chosun.com/english/industry-en/2024/05/12/OXL3OKUKFZDQDNMXZ5G5MEREWQ/ |access-date=2024-08-30 |website=The Chosun Daily |language=en}}</ref> 

=== Burn incidents ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2025}}

In 2023 to 2024, the Tanghulu recipe became so popular on platforms like [[TikTok]] and [[YouTube]] that it became a trend. The risk arose when a microwave-based preparation method for making the hard candy began to be promoted. Several cases of people suffering burns due to this method were reported, the main cause being a faulty container.

For hard candy to reach the crack hard stage, a temperature of 149&nbsp;°C or 300&nbsp;°F was required, with the container being a metal saucepan on the stove. However, it became popular to make the candy in plastic, borosilicate glass, soda-lime glass, or ceramic cups in the microwave, which led to several failures. The plastic cups, even though they were microwave-safe, would warp and melt to the point of forming holes, causing the hot sugar mixture to start spilling out, which would cause burns to feet. Meanwhile, borosilicate glass, soda-lime glass or ceramic cups could break or crack due to [[thermal shock]], causing burns to anyone nearby.

Various media outlets in the United States reported several cases of children and teenagers who were burned by the microwave method of making Tanghulu. Some opted to put sugar and water in the containers and even used candies like [[Jolly Rancher|Jolly Ranchers]] to make the sugar mixture. The trend became so dangerous that several candy manufacturers warned against making Tanghulu or any hard candy recipe in the microwave due to the potential risk of burns.
