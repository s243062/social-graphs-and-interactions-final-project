'''Pudding''' is a food which can either be a [[dessert]] or a [[Savoury (dish)|savoury]] dish. In the United States, ''pudding'' means a sweet, milk-based dessert similar in consistency to egg-based [[custard]]s, [[Bird's Custard|instant custards]] or a [[mousse]], often commercially set using [[cornstarch]], [[gelatin]] or similar coagulating agent. The modern American meaning of pudding as dessert has evolved from the original almost exclusive use of the term to describe savoury dishes, specifically those created using a process similar to that used for [[sausage]]s, in which meat and other ingredients in mostly liquid form are encased and then steamed or boiled to set the contents.

In the United Kingdom, Ireland and some [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, the word ''pudding'' is used to describe both sweet and savoury dishes. Savoury puddings include [[Yorkshire pudding]], [[black pudding]], [[suet pudding]] and [[steak and kidney pudding]]. Sweet puddings include [[bread pudding]], [[sticky toffee pudding]] and [[rice pudding]]. Unless qualified, however, pudding usually means dessert and in the United Kingdom, ''pudding'' is used as a [[synonym]] for dessert.<ref name="OED">''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''</ref> Puddings made for dessert can be boiled and steamed puddings, baked puddings, bread puddings, batter puddings, milk puddings or jellies.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last=Ysewijn |first=Regula |title=Pride and pudding : the history of British puddings savoury and sweet |year=2016 |others=Bruno Vergauwen |isbn=978-1-74336-738-4 |publisher=[[Murdoch Books]] |location=Sydney |oclc=941070366 }}</ref>

In some Commonwealth countries these puddings are known as [[custard]]s (or curds) if they are egg-thickened, as [[blancmange]] if starch-thickened, and as [[gelatin dessert|jelly]] if [[gelatin]]-based. Pudding may also refer to other dishes such as [[bread pudding]] and [[rice pudding]], although typically these names derive from their origin as British dishes.

==Etymology==
The word ''pudding'' is believed to come from the French {{wikt-lang|fr|boudin}}, which may derive from the Latin botellus, meaning "small sausage", referring to encased meats used in medieval European puddings.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |last=Wilson |first=C.

According to the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' the word ''pudding'' dates to the 13th century. It refers to the entrails or stomach of a sheep, pig or other animal stuffed with meat, offal, suet, oatmeal and seasonings.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Quinzio |first=Jeri |title=Pudding : a global history |date=2012 |publisher=Reaktion Books |isbn=978-1-78023-065-8 |location=London |oclc=828424823}}</ref> By the 1500s, the word was used to refer to the guts or entrails or the contents of other people's stomachs especially when pierced with a sword, as in battle.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2016-08-26 |title=The Grammarphobia Blog: Pudding and other ing-lish words |url=https://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2016/08/pudding-2.html |access-date=2022-08-22 |website=www.grammarphobia.com |language=en-US}}</ref> The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' describes puddings also as 'a boiled, steamed or baked dish made with various sweet (or sometimes) savoury ingredients added to the mixture, typically including milk, eggs, and flour (or other starchy ingredients such as suet, rice, semolina, etc.), enclosed within a crust made from such a mixture'.<ref name=":0" />

=== Savoury puddings ===
[[File:Haggis with a CC license.jpg|thumb|[[Haggis]], a savoury pudding]]

The modern usage of the word ''pudding'' to mean a dessert has evolved from the almost exclusive use of the term to describe a savoury dish, specifically those created using a process similar to [[sausage]]s, where meat and other ingredients in a mostly liquid form are encased and then steamed or boiled to set the contents. The most famous examples still surviving are [[black pudding]] and [[haggis]]. Other savoury dishes include [[suet pudding]]{{Contradictory inline|reason=Only some suet puddings are savory, while others (e.g. the Christmas puddings mentioned below) are sweet, according to the main article.|date=July 2025|article=Suet pudding|section=}} and [[steak and kidney pudding]]. Boiled or steamed pudding was a common main course aboard ships in the [[Royal Navy]] during the 18th and 19th centuries; pudding was used as the primary dish in which daily rations of [[flour]] and [[suet]] were employed.

=== Dessert puddings ===
[[File:Pudding With Raspberries and Whipped Cream.jpg|thumb|Pudding of the [[dessert]] type may be served with toppings such as fresh fruit and [[whipped cream]].]] [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] dessert puddings are rich, fairly homogeneous [[starch]]- or [[dairy]]-based desserts such as [[rice pudding]] or steamed cake mixtures such as [[treacle sponge pudding]] (with or without the addition of ingredients such as dried fruits as in a [[Christmas pudding]]).<ref name="OED"/>

In the United States and some parts of Canada, ''pudding'' characteristically denotes a sweet milk-based dessert similar in consistency to egg-based [[custard]]s, [[Bird's Custard|instant custards]] or a [[mousse]], often commercially set using [[cornstarch]], [[tapioca]], [[gelatin]], or similar coagulating agent such as the [[Jell-O]] brand line of products. In Commonwealth countries (other than some Canadian regions), these foods are known as [[custard]]s (or curds) if they are egg-thickened, [[blancmange]] if starch-thickened, and jelly if [[gelatin]]-based. Pudding may also refer to other dishes such as [[bread pudding]] and [[rice pudding]] in North America, although typically these names derive from their origin as British dishes.

==History==
One of the first documented mentions of pudding can be found in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' where a blood pudding roasted in a pig's stomach is described.<ref name=":0" /> This original meaning of a pudding as a sausage is retained in [[black pudding]], which is a [[blood sausage]] originating in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] made from [[pork]] or beef [[blood]], with [[Lard|pork fat]] or [[Suet|beef suet]], and a cereal.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Norwak |first=Mary |title=English puddings : sweet and savoury |date=2002 |publisher=Grub Street |isbn=1-904010-07-5 |location=London |oclc=48680079}}</ref>

Another early documented recipe for pudding is a reference to [[asida]] is found in a 10th-century Arabic cookbook by [[Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq]] called ''Kitab al-Ṭabīḫ'' ({{langx|ar|كتاب الطبيخ}}, ''The Book of Dishes'').<ref>{{cite book |last1=Al‑Warrāq's |first1=Ibn Sayyār |last2=Nasrallah |first2=Nawal |title=annals of the caliphs' kitchens: ibn sayyār al-warrāq's tenth-century baghdadi cookbook authors |date=2007 |publisher=Brill |page=97 |isbn=9789047423058 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sQCwCQAAQBAJ&q=Asida+dessert&pg=PA97 |access-date=29 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Al‑Warrāq |first1=Ibn Sayyār |last2=Nasrallah |first2=Nawal |title=annals of the caliphs' kitchens: ibn sayyār al-warrāq's tenth-century baghdadi cookbook |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dUC-e-l3XM8C |date=26 November 2007 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-9004158672 |access-date=29 August 2018 }}</ref> It was described as a thick pudding of dates cooked with clarified butter (''samn'').<ref name="CAW">{{cite book |last1=Al‑Warrāq's |first1=Ibn Sayyār |last2=Nasrallah |first2=Nawal |title=annals of the caliphs' kitchens: ibn sayyār al-warrāq's tenth-century baghdadi cookbook authors |date=2007 |publisher=Brill |page=97,98 |isbn=9789047423058 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sQCwCQAAQBAJ&q=Asida+dessert&pg=PA97 |access-date=29 August 2018}}</ref> A recipe for asida was also mentioned in an anonymous [[Al-Andalus|Hispano-Muslim]] cookbook dating to the 13th century. In the 13th and 14th centuries, in the mountainous region of the [[Rif]] along the Mediterranean coast of [[Morocco]], flour made from lightly grilled [[barley]] was used in place of wheat flour. A recipe for asida that adds [[argan]] seed oil was documented by [[Leo Africanus]] (c. 1465–1550), the Arab explorer known as Hasan al-Wazan in the Arab world.<ref name="CAW" /> According to the French scholar [[Maxime Rodinson]], asida were typical foods among the [[Bedouin]] of pre-Islamic and, probably, later times.<ref name="CAW" />

In the [[United Kingdom]] and some of the Commonwealth countries, the word ''pudding'' can be used to describe both sweet and savoury dishes. Unless qualified, however, the term in everyday usage typically denotes a dessert; in the United Kingdom, ''pudding'' is used as a synonym for a dessert course.<ref name="OED" />

Puddings had their 'real heyday...', according to food historian Annie Gray, '...from the seventeenth century onward'. It is argued that 'the future of the boiled suet pudding as one of England's national dishes was assured only when the [[pudding cloth]] came into use' and although puddings boiled in cloths may have been mentioned in the medieval era<ref>{{Cite book |last=GRAY |first=ANNIE |title=AT CHRISTMAS WE FEAST : festive food through the ages. |date=2021 |publisher=PROFILE BOOKS LTD |isbn=978-1-78816-819-9 |location=[S.l.] |oclc=1240493345}}</ref><ref name=":1" /> one of the earliest mentions is in 1617 in a recipe for the Cambridge pudding, a pudding cloth is indicated; 'throw your pudding in, being tied in a fair cloth; when it is boiled enough, cut it in the midst, and so serve it in'.<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{cite web |date=2017-12-21 |title=Travel back in time with Mary Honner's Cambridge pudding |url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/arid-20464755.html |access-date=2022-07-27 |website=Irish Examiner |language=en}}</ref>

The pudding cloth is said, according to food historian C. Anne Wilson, to have revolutionised puddings. 'The invention of the pudding-cloth or bag finally severed the link between puddings and animal guts. Puddings could now be made at any time, and they became a regular part of the daily fare of almost all classes. Recipes for them proliferated.'<ref name=":2" />

===Baked, steamed, and boiled puddings===
The original pudding was formed by mixing various ingredients with a [[grain]] product or other [[Binder (material)|binder]] such as [[butter]], [[flour]], [[cereal]], [[Egg as food|eggs]] or [[suet]], resulting in a solid mass. These puddings are [[Baking|baked]], [[Steaming|steamed]], or [[boiled]]. Depending on its ingredients, such a pudding may be served as a part of the [[main course]] or as a [[dessert]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Pudding vs. Dessert: The Same But Different|url=https://www.thespruceeats.com/difference-between-pudding-and-dessert-435332|access-date=2021-06-25|website=The Spruce Eats|language=en}}</ref>

Steamed pies consisting of a filling completely enclosed by suet pastry are also known as puddings. These may be sweet or savoury and include such dishes as [[steak and kidney pudding]].

===Creamy puddings===
[[File:Chocolate pudding.jpg|thumb|Instant dessert pudding]]
The second and newer type of pudding consists of [[sugar]], [[milk]], and a thickening agent such as [[cornstarch]], [[gelatin]], [[Egg (food)|eggs]], [[rice]] or [[tapioca]] to create a sweet, creamy dessert. These puddings are made either by [[simmer]]ing on top of the stove in a [[saucepan]] or [[double boiler]] or by baking in an [[oven]], often in a [[bain-marie]]. These puddings are easily scorched on the fire, which is why a double boiler is often used; [[microwave oven]]s are also now often used to avoid this problem and to reduce stirring.

Creamy puddings are typically served chilled, but a few, such as [[zabaglione]] and [[rice pudding]], may be served warm. [[Instant pudding]]s do not require boiling and can therefore be prepared more quickly.

This pudding terminology is common in North America and some European countries such as the [[Netherlands]], whilst in Britain, egg-thickened puddings are considered [[custard]]s and starch-thickened puddings called [[blancmange]].

'''Table cream''' is a dessert, similar to blancmange. The dessert was popularized by English manufacturer Symington's Ltd in the early 20th century. It is still produced under the Symington's brand name, but no longer made by the original company.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://symingtons.com/faqs/ |title=Frequently Asked Questions |website=symingtons.com |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191024180625/http://symingtons.com/faqs/ }}</ref>
