'''Dolma''' ({{langx|ota|طولمه}}; [[Arabic]]: دولما; {{langx|tr|dolma}}; {{langx|az|dolma}}; {{langx|hy|տոլմա|tolma}}) is a family of stuffed dishes associated with [[Ottoman cuisine]], typically made with a filling of rice, minced meat, [[offal]], seafood, fruit, or any combination of these inside either a leaf wrapping or a hollow or hollowed-out vegetable (e.g. a [[bell pepper]]). The leaf-wrapped type is specifically known as ''sarma'', or [[stuffed leaves]]. Less commonly, both fruits and meat (particularly offal) may also be stuffed with similar fillings. Dolma can be served warm or at room temperature and are common in modern cuisines of regions and nations that once were part of the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref name=davidson>{{cite book |last=Davidson |first=Alan |title=The Oxford Companion to Food |page=258}}</ref>

Some dishes of [[Armenian cuisine|Armenian]] cuisine with [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] names are also found across [[Turkey]] and other countries, making it difficult to determine the true national origin of such dishes.<ref name="pokhlyobkin"/>

[[William Pokhlebkin]], a specialist on culinary history and cookbook author, contends that the dish's inception traces back to Armenian culinary heritage:<ref name="pokhlyobkin">{{cite book|title=Национальные кухни наших народов|language=ru|author=[[William Pokhlyobkin]]|isbn=978-5-9524-2783-9|date=1978|publisher=Центрполиграф|trans-title=The Ethnic Cuisines of our Peoples.

During this period, Armenia's economy, its human and material resources declined, but its spiritual and material culture remained unchanged, and Armenian cuisine did not perish. On the contrary, Armenians contributed to the cuisine of the Seljuk Turks, so many truly Armenian dishes later became known in Europe through the Turks as, allegedly, Turkish cuisine (for example, dolma)."<ref name="pokhlyobkin"/></blockquote>

In Armenian, the dish is referred to as ''tolma'' in [[Eastern Armenian]] and ''dolma'' in [[Western Armenian]]. The etymology of the Armenian denomination comes from the old Armenian root ''toli'', which means "grape".<ref name="PMC11780856">{{cite journal|last1=Balant|first1=Manica|last2=Garnatje|first2=Teresa|last3=Vitales|first3=Daniel|last4=Oganesian|first4=Marine |last5=Vallès|first5=Joan|last6=Stepanyan‑Gandilyan|first6=Nina|last7=Gras|first7=Airy|title=Bridging past and present: exploring Cannabis traditions in Armenia through ethnobotanical interviews and bibliographic prospecting|journal=Journal of Cannabis Research|volume=7|pages=8|year=2025|doi=10.1186/s42238‑025‑00259‑x |doi-broken-date=21 October 2025 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

During winter months cabbage was a staple food for peasants in Persia and the Ottoman Empire, and it spread to the Balkans as well. Jews in Eastern Europe prepared variations of stuffed cabbage rolls with [[kosher]] meat—this dish is called [[holishkes]]. As meat was expensive, rice was sometimes mixed in with the meat. Jews in Europe would sometimes substitute [[barley]], bread or [[kasha]] (barley porridge) for the rice.<ref name=jta>{{Cite web| title = The Jews, stuffed cabbage and Simchat Torah| work = Jewish Telegraphic Agency| access-date = 2018-06-30| date = 2012-10-07| url = https://www.jta.org/2012/10/07/life-religion/the-jews-stuffed-cabbage-and-simchat-torah| url-status = live| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171110063130/https://www.jta.org/2012/10/07/life-religion/the-jews-stuffed-cabbage-and-simchat-torah| archive-date = 2017-11-10}}</ref> There are similar Slavic [[cabbage roll]]s: ''golubtsy'' in Russian, ''holubtsi'' in Ukrainian, ''[[gołąbki]]'' in Polish.

In the Persian Gulf, [[basmati]] rice is preferred, and the flavor of the stuffing may be enhanced using tomatoes, onions and [[cumin]].<ref name=tuttle/> Cabbage rolls entered [[Swedish cuisine]] (where they are known as ''kåldolmar'') after [[Charles XII]], defeated by the Russians at the [[battle of Poltava]], returned to Sweden in 1715 with his Turkish creditors and their cooks.<ref name=OUP/>

''Soğan dolması'' (''soğan'' means "onion" in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]), ''lts’onats sokh'' ({{Langx|hy|լցոնած սոխ}}; meaning “stuffed onion”), or stuffed onions, are a traditional dish in [[Turkey]], [[Armenia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]. The ingredients include onions, [[minced beef]], [[rice]], oil, [[tomato purée]], [[paprika]], [[vinegar]] or [[sour cream]], [[strained yogurt]], [[black pepper]], salt and spices. After the onion's skin is removed, the larger, external, layers (leaves) of onion bulbs are used as containers, so-called "shirts" for the meat stuffing. The remaining part of the onion is also used, mixed with the meat and fried on oil for a couple of minutes, to obtain the base of the stuffing. To extract the separate "shirts", the entire bulbs are cut on the top and then boiled until soft enough to be pried off, layer by layer. In order to prevent a further softening and crumbling, the bulbs should be [[blanching (cooking)|blanched]]. The "shirts" are removed from the bulbs by slow and gentle finger pressure. Filled "shirts" are boiled slowly at low heat in [[broth]]. The level of liquid should be sufficient to cover the dolmas entirely. Onion dolma are usually served with dense natural yogurt.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

[[Stuffed peppers]] ({{Langx|hy|լցոնած բիբար}}, {{Langx|el|γεμιστές πιπεριές}}, {{Langx|tr|biber dolması}}) are common in many cuisines, while mostly popular in [[Armenia]], [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]]. [[Bell peppers]] are hollowed and filled with rice, herbs, onions, currants and optionally [[Raisin|raisins]]. The Armenian version adds [[tarragon]], [[Mentha|mint]], [[walnuts]] and/or [[pine nuts]] to the stuffing.{{cn|date=July 2025}} In the cuisine of the [[Crimean Tatars]], ''dolma'' refers to peppers stuffed with minced lamb or beef, rice, onion, salt, pepper. Carrots, greens, tomato paste, and spices can be added to the filling. When grape leaves are stuffed with the same filling, however, they are called ''sarma''.
