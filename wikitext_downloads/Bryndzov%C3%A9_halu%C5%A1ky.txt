== History and terminology ==
In the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], two types of galuska were developed at the same time: the potato galuska of the mountains and the galuska of the plains, without potatoes. Potatoes could be grown in harsher conditions and became a staple food for the poorer mountain dwellers, as less expensive flour was needed for the dough. Today the [[Slovaks]] call the soft dough dumplings with boiled potatoes and sheep's cheese ''bryndzové halušky'', while the [[Hungarians in Slovakia|local Hungarians]] call it ''sztrapacska''.  The Slovak ''[[Kapustové halušky|strapačky]]'' is a dish made mainly of dumplings with potatoes, as opposed to its [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] counterpart the ''[[Spätzle|nokedli]]'', which do not contain potatoes.{{Cn|date=February 2025}}
