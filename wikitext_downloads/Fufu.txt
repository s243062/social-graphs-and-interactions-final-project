Although the original ingredients for fufu are boiled [[cassava]], [[Cooking banana|plantains]], and [[cocoyam]], it is also made in different ways in other West African countries. In Ghana, [[Ivory Coast]], and [[Liberia]], they use the method of separately mixing and pounding equal portions of boiled cassava with green plantain or cocoyam, or by mixing cassava/plantains or cocoyam flour with water and stirring it on a stove. Its thickness is then adjusted to personal preference, and it is eaten with [[broth]]-like soups. In Nigeria, fufu is common and made from fermented cassava. It is made solely from fermented cassava, giving it its unique thickness compared to that found in other West African countries. It is eaten with a variety of soups such as [[Egusi soup]], [[Onugbu soup]], vegetables, and lots of beef and fish.<ref name="Nweke">{{cite web|last1=Nweke|first1=Felix I.|title=THE CASSAVA TRANSFORMATION IN AFRICA|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0154e/A0154E02.HTM |publisher=United Nations|access-date=10 June 2014}}</ref> In recent years other flours, such as [[semolina]], [[maize|maize flour]], or mashed plantains, may take the place of cassava flour. This is common for those in the diaspora or families that live in urban cities. Families in rural areas with access to farmland still maintain the original recipe of using cassava. Fufu is traditionally eaten with the fingers, and a small ball of it can be dipped into an accompanying soup or sauce.<ref>{{Cite web |title=What is Fufu, the West African Delicacy? |url=https://www.finedininglovers.com/article/fufu-what-is-it-how-to-eat-it |access-date=2022-09-17 |website=www.finedininglovers.com |language=en}}</ref>

==In Africa <span class="anchor" id="African fufu"></span>==
Before the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] traders introduced [[cassava]] to [[Africa]] from Brazil in the 16th century, fufu was mainly made from cocoyam, plantain, and yams.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0154e/A0154E07.htm|title=A review of cassava in Africa with country case studies on Nigeria, Ghana, the United Republic of Tanzania, Uganda and Benin|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2018-04-22}}</ref> The traditional method of eating fufu is to pinch some of the fufu off in one's right-hand fingers and form it into an easily ingested round ball. The ball is then dipped in the soup before being eaten.

===Angola===
In [[Angola]], fufu is served as part of the national dish but is called fungi/fungee and is made using [[cornmeal]] and [[okra]]. 

===In Cote d'Ivoire <span class="anchor" id="Fufu made in Cote d'Ivoire"></span>===
In [[Ivory Coast|Côte d'Ivoire]], the word ''foutou'' is also used. Ivorian ''foufou'' is specifically mashed sweet plantains, whereas ''foutou'' is a stronger, heavier paste made of various staple foods such as [[yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[cassava]], [[Cooking banana|plantains]], [[taro]] or a mix of any of those.

===In Cameroon <span class="anchor" id="Fufu made in Cameroon"></span>===
In the French-speaking regions of [[Cameroon]], it is called "''couscous''" (not to be confused with the North African dish [[couscous]]).<ref>DeLancey, Mark W., and Mark Dike DeLancey (2000). ''Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Cameroon'', 3rd ed. Lanham, Maryland: The Scarecrow Press, p. 134.</ref>

===In Ghana <span class="anchor" id="Fufu made in Ghana"></span> ===
[[File:Pounding of fufu.jpg|thumb|Pounding of fufu in Ghana]]
Although people from  Eastern Africa and Southern Africa use the term ''fufu'' (or ''fufuo'') for their type of corn or maize dough dish called ''[[ugali]]'' or ''[[nshima]]'', in Ghana, these are not the same. Rather, ''ugali'' or ''nshima'' can be found in Ghana, where it is called ''akple'', ''nsihoo'' (white ''etsew'' without the corn bran), or ''tuo zaafi'', which are made from unfermented corn flour, unlike the other fermented corn dough foods such as ''etsew'', ''dokuno'' (''kenkey''), ''banku'', ''fonfom'', among others in Ghanaian cuisine.
It is believed to originate in what is now modern-day [[Ghana]],<ref name="BFF">{{cite web |last1=Siciliano-Rosen |first1=L. |title="Fufu" African, West African, Staple Food, Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/fufu|website=Britannica |language=en |date=28 June 2025}}</ref> by the [[Ashanti people|Asante]], the [[Akuapem people|Akuapem]], the [[Akyem]], the [[Bono people|Bono]], and the [[Fante people|Fante]] people of the [[Akan people|Akan]] [[Demographics of Ghana|ethnic group]] of Ghana and now generally accepted across the country.{{Citation needed|date=January 2024}}<ref>{{Cite web |date=April 22, 2024 |title=The Akan People|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Akan |website=Britannica}}</ref> According to historian Miller, "the word Fufu literally means white in Twi."<ref>{{harvp|Miller|2022|p=89}}</ref> and is likely derived from the whitish colour of the cassava component in Ghanaian fufu. In Ghana, it is made out of pieces of boiled [[cassava]] and/or other tubers such as [[Cooking banana|plantain]] or [[cocoyam]]. It is mostly pounded together in a locally made wooden [[Mortar and pestle|mortar]] (woduro) using a wooden [[pestle]]<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-11-26|title=Top 5 healthy meals to enjoy when in Ghana - MyJoyOnline.com|url=https://www.myjoyonline.com/top-5-healthy-meals-to-enjoy-when-in-ghana/|access-date=2022-01-22|website=www.myjoyonline.com|language=en-US}}</ref> (woma). In between blows from the pestle, the mixture is turned by hand, and water is gradually added until it becomes a soft, sticky dough. The [[mixture]] is then formed into a rounded slab and served. With the invention of the [[fufu machine]], preparation has become much less labour-intensive. The resulting food is eaten with liquid soups (nkwan) such as light soup (nkrakra nkwan), [[abenkwan]] (palm nut soup), [[nkatenkwan]] (peanut butter soup), and abunubunu soup. Today, it also features in [[Beninese cuisine]], [[Cameroonian cuisine]], [[Guinean cuisine]], [[Congolese cuisine]], [[Nigerian cuisine]],<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3tGx1AFv2E4C&q=fufu+del+caribe+y+africa&pg=PA17 | title=Metodos para agregar valor a raices y tuberculos alimenticios: manual para el desarrollo de productos | publisher=CIAT | author=Wheatley, Christopher | year=1997 | pages=17 | isbn=9589439896}}</ref> and [[Togolese cuisine]], where it is eaten with hot pepper soup, [[okra]], or other kinds of stew. Fufu was a major cuisine of the [[Ashanti Empire]].<ref>{{harvp|Miller|2022|p=111}}</ref> In Ghana, fufu, also known as fufuo, is white and sticky, if plantain is not mixed with the cassava when pounding.

===In Nigeria <span class="anchor" id="Fufu or Akpu made in Nigeria"></span> ===
In [[Nigeria]], ''fufu'' or ''akpu'' is a popular food made from fresh or fermented [[cassava]]. The Nigerian version of Fufu differs from that of Ghana's; however, it remains a staple food in both countries.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/y5548e/y5548e08.htm|title=cassava}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-07-14 |title=HOW TO MAKE WATER FUFU FROM SCRATCH - CASSAVA FUFU |url=https://www.preciouscore.com/water-fufu-cassava-fufu/ |access-date=2022-05-12 |website=Precious Core |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-02-17 |title=How To Make Fufu From Scratch (Nigerian Fufu) |url=https://www.myactivekitchen.com/how-to-cook-fufu-from-scratch-nigerian-fufu/ |access-date=2022-05-12 |website=My Active Kitchen |language=en-GB}}</ref> In Nigeria, cassava-based fufu, commonly referred to as akpu, originated primarily among the Igbo people of southeastern Nigeria and various ethnic groups in the South-South region. Its preparation and consumption are deeply embedded in the cultural and culinary practices of these communities. However, over time, fufu has been adopted by numerous other Nigerian ethnic groups, each incorporating it into their diets with localized variations in preparation and accompanying soups. The preparation of Yoruba fufu differs slightly from other ethnic groups. It is made from fermented cassava of which the soft pieces are sieved. The starchy remains are boiled and stirred with a wooden rod until it turns into dough.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Etejere |first1=Emmanuel O. |last2=Bhat |first2=Ramakrishna B. |date=1985 |title=Traditional Preparation and Uses of Cassava in Nigeria |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4254732 |journal=Economic Botany |volume=39 |issue=2 |page=161|doi=10.1007/BF02907839 |jstor=4254732 |issn=0013-0001|url-access=subscription }}</ref> Akpu, properly punctuated as '''akpụ''' in Igbo, is the Igbo word for cassava. Requiring several days to make, akpu is often eaten with [[egusi soup]]. Akpu is traditionally made by peeling and washing raw cassava until it is white. The cassava is soaked in water for 3–4 days to [[ferment]] and become soft.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Accelerate Tv - Under Maintenance |url=https://acceleratetv.com/how-to-make-cassava-fufu-akpu/ |access-date=2022-05-12 |website=acceleratetv.com }}{{Dead link|date=May 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Processing of akpu/fufu Recipe by Emryson's Kitchen |url=https://cookpad.com/ng/recipes/6663357-processing-of-akpufufu |access-date=2022-05-12 |website=Cookpad |date=9 January 2019 |language=en}}</ref> It is then filtered with a porous [[calabash]] or sieve. Excess water is quickly drained by pouring the wet paste into a sack, upon which is placed a heavy and flat item (e.g., a plank and brick). The paste is then pounded and molded into large balls and simmered for 30–60 seconds, after which it is thoroughly pounded to remove lumps, molded again into smaller balls, boiled for 15–20 minutes, and then pounded until smooth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nigeriagalleria.com/Health_Lifestyle/Recipe/Fufu/Akpu.html|title=Akpu Cassava Fufu Recipe:: Nigerian Dishes :: Galleria Health and Lifestyle, Nigeria|website=www.nigeriagalleria.com|language=en-NG|access-date=2018-05-05}}</ref> It is popular throughout Nigeria, particularly in the South-East and South-South.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/y5548e/y5548e08.htm|title=cassava}}</ref>

==In the Caribbean <span class="anchor" id="Caribbean fufu"></span>==
In [[Caribbean]] nations with substantial populations of West African origin (such as [[Cuba]], [[Jamaica]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Haiti]] and [[Puerto Rico]]), [[Cooking banana|plantains]], cassava or yams are mashed with other ingredients.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

===Cuba===
In [[Cuba]], the dish retains its original African stem name, termed simply as ''fufú'' or with added descriptive extensions like ''fufú de plátano'' or ''fufú de plátano pintón.''<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c1EztLtky10C&q=Cuban+Plantain+Fufu+The+Cuban+Kitchen++By+Raquel+Rabade+Roque&pg=PA151 | title=The Cuban Kitchen | publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group | author=Rabade Roque, Raquel | year=2011 | location=NY | pages=151 | isbn=978-0307595430}}</ref>

===Dominican Republic===
In the [[Dominican Republic]], a beloved dish, [[mangú]], is very similar to ''fufú.'' Mangú is made from mashed, boiled green plantains, typically topped with sautéed red onions cooked in vinegar.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tRuZAAAAQBAJ&q=Daisy+Martinez+Green+Plantain+and+Salt+Pork+Mash&pg=PT183 | title=Daisy Cooks!: Latin Flavors That Will Rock Your World | publisher=Hachette Books | author=Martinez, Daisy | year=2013| isbn=9781401306120 }}</ref>

===Haiti ===
In [[Haiti]], it is called ''tonm tonm'' and ''foofoo''. It is mostly made of [[breadfruit]] but can be made of plantain or yams and is usually served with an [[okra]] based stew or soup. It is primarily consumed in the southernmost regions of Haiti namely the [[Grand'Anse (department)|Grand'Anse]] and [[Sud (department)|Sud]] departments. The city of [[Jérémie]] is regarded as the tonmtonm capital of Haiti.

===Puerto Rican=== 
Puerto Rican [[mofongo]], in keeping with the creolized cuisine traditions of the Caribbean, tends toward a ''fufú'' of much higher density and robust seasoning. While keeping a conspicuous African character, mofongo has borrowed from the island's [[Hispanic|Iberian]] culinary tradition, to create a dish made of fried green and yellow plantains, cassava or [[breadfruit]]. Unlike the mushier Caribbean and West African ''fufús'', mofongo is generally firmer and crustier. To prepare mofongo, green plantains are deep-fried once unlike twice fried [[tostones]]. Next, they are mashed in a 'pilon' ([[mortar and pestle|mortar]]) with chopped garlic, salt, black pepper and olive oil. The resulting mash is then pressed and rounded into a hollowed crusty orb. Meat, traditionally ''[[chicharrón]]'', is then stuffed into the chunky ball of fried green plantains. Some recipes call for a meat or vegetable ''salsa criolla''" (related to American Creole sauce) poured atop the hot sphere. In the trendier "mofongo relleno", typical of western Puerto Rico, seafood is all over, inside and outside. Traditional mofongo, as previously cited, comes seasoned and stuffed with meat and bathed in a chicken broth soup.<ref>Food and Identity in the Caribbean, Hanna Garth, Ed. 2013 Bloomsbury Press.</ref> Because of its elaborate process of preparation and its sundry ingredients, poet and blogger Arose N Daghetto called the mofongo a type of "fufú paella" and branded it as "the big daddy of fufús".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://literaturevoodoo.wordpress.com/say-whaaat-fufu-and-mofungo-arosendaghetto/ | title=Say Whaaat??– Fufu and Mofongo! | publisher=Literature Voodoo-- Quite Storm Enterprises | work=Article | date=2011 | access-date=December 17, 2015 | author=Daghetto, Arose N.}}</ref> Although mofongo is associated with being fried, boiled and roasting plantain mofongo predate fried mofongo and is still excited but a rare find in Puerto Rico. A dish called ''funche'' made with taro, green and yellow plantains boiled and mashed with butter, garlic, and pork fat was once popular in Puerto Rico. Once mashed it was formed into balls and eaten with broth made from sesame seeds. Funche is written in early Puerto Rican cookbooks around the 1800s, but can probably be traced back to African slaves on the island. Funche today in Puerto Rico is cornmeal cooked in coconut milk and milk.

===Anglo-Caribbean===
The vegetable or fufú sauce in the [[Anglo-Caribbean]] is not fried first. [[Cooking banana|Plantain]] is not used as much, as it is used in so many dishes. Fufu is usually part of, or added to, a soupy sauce or on the side with a soupy dish. Similarly to Angola, [[Barbados]] serves it as part of the national dish and is called ''[[cou-cou]]'' and uses cornmeal or, less commonly, split peas, green bananas, or [[breadfruit]] instead, like several other English Caribbean islands.
