==Preparation==
The fish traditionally used in ''mas huni'' was the cured tuna ''[[Maldives fish|valhoamas]]'', but many Maldivians currently use [[canned tuna]].{{fact|date=June 2025}}

Traditionally, when fish was scarce, chopped leaves were added to the ''mas huni'' mixture. The green leaves of certain local plants and trees such as ''diguthiyara'' ''([[Senna occidentalis]])'', ''kuḷhafilaa'' or ''gōramfau'' (''[[Launaea sarmentosa]]''), ''mābulhā'' (''[[Abutilon theophrasti]]''), ''muranga'' (''[[Moringa oleifera]]''), ''massāgu'' (''[[Amaranthus spinosus]]'' or ''[[Amaranthus viridis]]'') sweet potato (''[[Ipomoea batatas]]'') and ''ḷos'' (''[[Pisonia grandis]]''), among others, replaced the fish in ''mas huni'' in a smaller or greater proportion.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>{{Failed verification|date=January 2024}}

''Mas huni'' may be made with ''kopee'' ([[collard greens]]) leaves.{{fact|date=June 2025}}

Another variant of ''mas huni'' is made with muranga pods (''[[Moringa oleifera]]'') instead of leaves. First the pods are boiled; then the flesh with the seeds is scooped out. This is mixed  with the rest of the ingredients. This same type of thicker ''mas huni'' can be also made with tora (''[[Luffa aegyptiaca]]''), boiled [[butternut squash]] or [[pumpkin]].<ref>Himāl Southasian - ''Eating on the Islands''</ref>
