'''Rice and peas''' or '''peas and rice''' is a [[traditional food|traditional rice dish]] in some [[Caribbean]] and [[Latin American]] countries. Sometimes, the dish is made with [[pigeon peas]], otherwise called 'gungo peas' by Jamaicans.<ref name=":jgp">{{cite news|url=https://jamaica.loopnews.com/content/botanical-roots-why-you-should-eat-gungo-peas | title=Botanical Roots: Why you should eat gungo peas &#124; Loop Jamaica }}</ref> [[Kidney beans]] ('red peas'/beans) and other similar varieties are typically used in the [[Greater Antilles]] and coastal [[Latin America]]. Rice and peas recipes vary throughout the region, with each country having its own way(s) of making them and name(s)—with the two main ingredients being [[legumes]] (peas/beans) and rice, combined with [[herbs]], [[spices]] and/or [[coconut milk]].

Rice and peas, a one-pot [[Creole cuisine|Creole]] dish that originated in the Caribbean during the colonial era, includes a mixture of ingredients, cooking techniques and spices influenced by various [[ethnic]] groups in the region. 

The  [[Spaniards|Spanish]], the first [[Demographics of Europe|European]] arrivals to the [[Americas]], contributed many peas/bean dishes and rice dishes. They also introduced [[Asian rice]] to the Caribbean and Latin America, as well as herbs and spices like garlic, thyme, onion, and oregano.<ref name=":colex">{{cite web |last=Crosby |first=Alfred W.|title=The Columbian Exchange: Plants, Animals, and Disease between the Old and New Worlds |publisher=[[National Humanities Center]] |date=December 2001 |url=https://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/tserve/nattrans/ntecoindian/essays/columbianb.htm}}</ref><ref name="slavery">West, Jean M.{{cite web |title=Rice and Slavery |url=http://slaveryinamerica.org/history/hs_es_rice.htm |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101092714/http://slaveryinamerica.org/history/hs_es_rice.htm |archive-date=January 1, 2007 |access-date=December 10, 2024}}</ref> [[Kidney beans]], another key ingredient, are thought to have originated in [[Peru]] around 8,000 B.C.,<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1108973109 | volume=109 | title=Mesoamerican origin of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is revealed by sequence data | year=2012 | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | pages=E788–E796 | issue=14 | pmid=22393017 | pmc=3325731 | doi-access=free | last1=Bitocchi | first1=Elena | last2=Nanni | first2=Laura | last3=Bellucci | first3=Elisa | last4=Rossi | first4=Monica | last5=Giardini | first5=Alessandro | last6=Zeuli | first6=Pierluigi Spagnoletti | last7=Logozzo | first7=Giuseppina | last8=Stougaard | first8=Jens | last9=McClean | first9=Phillip | last10=Attene | first10=Giovanna | last11=Papa | first11=Roberto }}</ref><ref name=":peru">{{cite web |url=https://www.camelliabrand.com/about-the-bean/about-red-kidney-beans/#:~:text=Red%20kidney%20beans%20are%20thought,the%20Indians%20of%20the%20Americas.| title=The Red Kidney Bean Story| date=28 August 2012|access-date=2024-12-10 }}</ref> and [[cultivars]] were dispersed throughout the Americas by indigenous [[Amerindian]] tribes by 500 B.C.,<ref name="sanderson">{{cite book |last1=Pearman |first1=Georgina |title=The Cultural History of Plants |date=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-92746-3 |editor1-last=Prance |editor1-first=Ghillean |pages=143–144 |editor2-last=Nesbitt |editor2-first=Mark}}</ref> then later the Spanish and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], who introduced them to other parts of the world.<ref name=":colex"/>

==Variations and similar dishes==
===Caribbean===

'''Jamaica'''

Rice and peas from [[Jamaica]] is one of the most popular variations from the region. It is typically eaten as a [[side dish]], often accompanied with [[meats]] or [[seafood]]. Jamaican rice and peas has been introduced to other parts of the world by the [[diaspora]], and is eaten in other countries outside of the Caribbean. In Jamaica, the dish is especially prepared on Sundays for dinner.  [[Kidney beans]] and other similar cultivars are normally used to prepare the dish; however, [[pigeon peas]] (gungo peas) and Jerusalem peas (''[[Phaseolus trinervius]]'') are traditionally cooked during the [[Christmas]] season.<ref>{{Cite web |title= 7 Reasons Jamaican Christmas Is the Best |date=8 December 2015 |url=https://epicjamaica.net/7-things-that-make-a-jamaican-christmas-the-best-in-the-world/|access-date=2024-12-10|language=en}}</ref>
