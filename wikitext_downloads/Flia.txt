'''Flia''', '''fli''', '''fliya''' or '''flija''' ([[Albanian language|Albanian]] [[Definiteness|indefinite form]]: '''fli''') is an [[Albanian cuisine|Albanian]] [[Dish (food)|dish]] typical of northern Albania and of the [[cuisine of Kosovo]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/Flija|title=Facebook |website=[[Facebook]] }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kosovoguide.com/?cid=2,227,878 |title=Kosovo Guide |access-date=2013-03-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321053519/http://kosovoguide.com/?cid=2,227,878 |archive-date=2016-03-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.podravka.com/company/markets/kosovo/tab-cuisine-of-kosovo|title=Kosovo Pastry dishes|access-date=2013-06-06|archive-date=2013-05-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528131108/http://www.podravka.com/company/markets/kosovo/tab-cuisine-of-kosovo|url-status=dead}}</ref> It consists of multiple [[crêpe]]-like layers brushed with cream and served with [[sour cream]] and [[butter]].  The name translates to "sacrifice" (see ''[[:wikt:fli#Albanian|fli]]''). Flia is prepared in the shape of the Sun (Albanian [[Dielli (Albanian paganism)|Dielli]]) also featuring  sunbeams.<ref name=KultPlus>{{cite web|title=Flija, mbretëresha e kuzhinës shqiptare që simbolizon diellin në Ditën e Verës|trans-title=Flija, the Queen of Albanian Cuisine that Symbolizes the Sun on Summer's Day|website=KultPlus|language=sq|access-date=6 December 2024|url=https://www.kultplus.com/lajme/flija-mbreteresha-e-kuzhines-shqiptare-qe-simbolizon-diellin-ne-diten-e-veres/}}</ref>

==Tradition==
March 17, which falls within the [[Albanian paganism|traditional Albanian festivities]] of [[Verëza]] ([[march equinox|spring equinox]]), is recognized as "Flia Day" in which families invite their relatives for preparing and eating flia.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Albanian Flija {{!}} Albanian Pancake|url=https://www.myalbanianfood.com/recipe/albanian-flija-pancake/|access-date=2020-09-17|website=My Albanian Food|date=26 February 2017 |language=en-GB}}</ref> It is assumed that flia began to be prepared by Albanians for Verëza as a sacrifice to the [[Dielli (Albanian paganism)|Sun-god]].<ref name=KultPlus/>

==Preparation==
Flia requires very simple ingredients, although it takes a rather long time to prepare. The ingredients are [[flour]], water, [[butter]], [[yogurt]], [[eggs as food|eggs]], oil and salt. Some variations use [[kaymak]] as the filling instead.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Albanian Flija {{!}} Albanian Pancake |url=https://www.myalbanianfood.com/recipe/albanian-flija-pancake/ |access-date=2022-09-23 |website=My Albanian Food |date=26 February 2017 |language=en-GB}}</ref> The main ingredients (flour, water and salt) are mixed together until they become like pancake batter. Flija is not a sweet dish, and is instead a savory main course dish eaten usually during lunch or dinner. Layers of batter are baked using a ''[[Sač|saq]]'', a spherical metal lid used for baking.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tasteatlas.com/flija|title=Flija &#124; Traditional Pancake From Albania &#124; TasteAtlas|website=www.tasteatlas.com}}</ref>
