It is also known as ''[[Naryn (dish)|naryn]]'' in [[Xinjiang]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Kazakhstan]], as '''''turama''''' in [[Karakalpakstan]] and [[Nogaysky District, Dagestan|Dagestan]], as '''''dograma''''' in  [[Turkmenistan]], and as '''''kullama''''' in [[Bashkortostan]] and [[Tatarstan]]. 

Beshbarmak, which means "five fingers" in Turkic languages, refers to the traditional practice of eating the dish with one's hands. This name is believed to have emerged later, especially after Russian cultural and ethnographic observations of the nomadic peoples of Central Asia. Another name for beshbarmak in Kyrgyz is ''tuuralgan et'', which means crumbled or chopped meat. Beshbarmak is usually made from finely chopped boiled [[meat]], mixed with [[dough]] (typically egg noodles) and ''chyk'', an onion sauce. It is typically served on large communal platters, shared between several people,<ref name="NG">{{cite web |title=Understanding Identity and Kyrgyz Cultural Values Through Food |url=https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2017/12/06/understanding-identity-and-kyrgyz-cultural-values-through-food/ |website=National Geographic}}</ref> after [[Chorba|shorpo]], a first course of mutton broth served in bowls called [[kese]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Teorii de istorie culinară care ne dezamăgesc: borşul şi mujdeiul, singurele alimente cu adevărat româneşti.

==Historical background==
The cuisine of Central Asia developed within the constraints of a nomadic life, when people were completely reliant on their animals. This is reflected in Central Asian dishes, which are rich in meat and dairy products.<ref name="Edge">{{Cite web |date=2015-05-26 |title=Beshbarmak: Five Finger Food |url=https://www.edgekz.com/beshbarmak-five-finger-food/ |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220408132826/https://www.edgekz.com/beshbarmak-five-finger-food/ |archive-date=2022-04-08 |access-date=2020-01-22 |website=Edge : Kazakhstan |language=en}}</ref>

The construction of beshbarmak as a national dish dates to the [[Soviet literature]] having inherited the [[nomadic]] and "settler" dichotomy from the [[Russian Empire]]. Two books were foundational in the formation of the national cuisines of Central Asian peoples: ''Kniga o vkusnoi i zdorovoi pishche'' ([[The Book of Tasty and Healthy Food]]) and ''Natsional’nyie kukhni nashikh narodov'' ([[National cuisines of our peoples]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Alymbaeva |first1=Aida Aaly |title=Nations of Plov and Beshbarmak: Central Asian Food and National Identity on the Internet |journal=The Muslim World |date=18 December 2019 |volume=110 |issue=1 |pages=107–125 |doi=10.1111/muwo.12321 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

==The serving ritual==
The serving of beshbarmak is steeped in ritual. If an animal, such as a sheep, was slaughtered in a guest's honor, then the host serves ''ustukan'', different cuts of meat, to different people, depending on their gender, age, and rank in the social structure. As a sign of respect, the oldest people and honored guests are always presented the prime cuts of the meat.

On special occasions, the guest of honor, the eldest male, or the youngest male, receives the ''bash'', the head of the animal, and cuts pieces from it to distribute to other people. The oldest men or [[aksakal]] receives the ''jambash'',<ref name="Edge" /> the thigh bone. The oldest and most respected women receive the ''kuiruk'' or ''kuymulchak'', the tailbone. The legs and shoulders are presented to the younger adults, and the smaller bones are reserved for the [[daughter-in-law]] of the house. The ''omurtka'', the spine, is given to the children.

Other ''ustukans'' include the ''joto jïlïk,'' tibia or shin bone, the ''kashka jïlïk,'' thigh or femur bone, the bone from rib to thigh called the ''karchiga'', a rib without fat called the ''kara kabirga'', the ''kar jïlïk'' or radius bone, ''dalii'' or shoulder blade, the ''toshi,'' breast or brisket, and the ''kung jïlïk,'' bone from the leg to the shoulder blade.

==Preparation==
[[File:shorpo.jpg|thumb|''Shorpo'', mutton broth served before beshbarmak]]
In the classic variant of beshbarmak, as it is now prepared in northern Kyrgyzstan (especially in the [[Naryn Region|Naryn region]]), a sharp knife called a ''maki'' ({{langx|ky|маки}}) is required to thinly dice all the ingredients before they are put on the [[dastarkhan]]. The dish also requires a pot to boil the meat and noodles in, and a rolling pin to roll out the noodles.

Beshbarmak is prepared by first boiling a piece of meat, such as the rump of a horse, or a rack of lamb, or ''qazı'' or ''chuchuk'' horsemeat sausage. In warm seasons, beshbarmak is usually made with [[mutton]].

The noodle dough is made from flour, water, eggs, and salt, and rested for 40 minutes. Then the dough is rolled out very thinly, and cut into noodles.<ref name="Edge" />
