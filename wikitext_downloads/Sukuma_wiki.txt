'''Sukuma wiki''' is an [[African cuisine|East African dish]] made with [[collard greens]], known as {{lang|sw|sukuma}}, cooked with [[onion]]s and [[spice]]s.<ref name="Hobbs 2017">{{cite news |last=Hobbs |first=Jane-Anne |title=15 of Africa's favorite dishes |url=https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/africa-food-dishes/index.html |accessdate=18 December 2018 |publisher=[[CNN Travel]] |date=12 July 2017 |language=en}}</ref> It is often served and eaten with [[ugali]] (made from maize flour).<ref name="Hobbs 2017" />

In  [[Tanzania]], [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]] and other parts of [[East Africa]], [[colewort]] are more commonly known by their Swahili name, ''sukuma'', and are often referred to as [[collard greens]]. It is also commonly mistaken for [[kale]].

The literal translation of the phrase 'sukuma wiki' is to "push the week" or "stretch the week". It is a vegetable that is generally affordable and available all-year round in this region. It forms part of the staple dish in this region together with ugali or [[Sadza|sima]]. Sakuma is also known as "agaar" in the Somali language and is part of Somali culture.

==Description==
The cultivar group name ''Acephala'' ("without a head" in [[Greek language|Greek]]) refers to the fact that this variety of ''B.&nbsp;oleracea'' does not have the usual close-knit core of leaves (a "head") like [[cabbage]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.floridata.com/ref/b/bras_ole_kale.cfm |title=Brassica oleracea var. acephala |publisher=Floridata |date=2007-02-06 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}</ref> The plant is a [[Biennial plant|biennial]] where winter frost occurs, and [[Perennial plant|perennial]] in even colder regions. It is also moderately sensitive to salinity. It has an upright stalk, often growing up to two feet tall. The plant is very similar and closely related to [[kale]]. The preparation is different from traditional preparation of collard greens in the United States.

==Cultivation and storage==
The plant is commercially cultivated for its thick, slightly bitter, edible leaves. For best [[Texture (food)|texture]], the leaves should be picked before they reach their maximum size, at which stage the leaves will be thicker and should be cooked differently from the new leaves. Age will not affect flavor. Flavor and texture also depend on the [[cultivar]]; the ''couve-manteiga'' and ''couve tronchuda'' are especially appreciated in [[Brazil]] and [[Portugal]].

==Culinary use==
Sukuma wiki has been eaten for at least 2,000 years, with evidence showing that the [[Ancient Greeks]] cultivated several forms of both colewort and kale.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Greeks and Romans Grew Kale and Collards |url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/archives/parsons/publications/vegetabletravelers/kale.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824071419/http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/archives/parsons/publications/vegetabletravelers/kale.html |archive-date=24 August 2010 |work=Our Vegetable Travelers |accessdate=7 August 2025}}</ref>

In the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Kenya]] (East Africa), thinly sliced colewort are the main accompaniments of a popular dish known as [[ugali]] (also sometimes called sima, sembe or posho), a corn flour cake.

Sukuma wiki is mainly lightly sauteed in oil until tender, flavored with onions and seasoned with salt, which can be served either as the main accompaniment or as a side dish with preferred meat (fish, chicken, beef, pork).

Fresh sukuma wiki leaves can be stored for up to 10 days if refrigerated to just above freezing (1&nbsp;°C) at high humidity (>95%). In domestic refrigerators, fresh colewort can be stored for about three days. Once cooked, they can be frozen and stored for greater lengths of time.
