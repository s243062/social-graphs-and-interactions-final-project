'''Karađorđeva šnicla''' ({{langx|en|Karađorđe's schnitzel}}, {{langx|sr|Карађорђева шницла}}) is a [[breaded cutlet]] dish named after the Serbian revolutionary [[Karađorđe]]. The dish consists of a rolled veal, pork, or chicken [[steak]], stuffed with [[kaymak]], which is then [[breaded]] and fried. It is served with [[tartar sauce]] and a slice of lemon on the side, and sometimes [[french fries]] or steamed vegetables. Created by [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s chef {{ill|Mića Stojanović|sr|Milovan Mića Stojanović|v=sup}} in 1956 or 1957 as an improvisation of [[chicken Kiev]], it has become a regular staple in [[Serbian cuisine]]. Stojanović unsuccessfully tried to patent his original recipe, which has since been adapted to several variations.

== History ==
Karađorđeva šnicla was created by {{ill|Mića Stojanović|sr|Milovan Mića Stojanović|v=sup}}, a retired cooking professor, former head chef at [[InterContinental Belgrade]], and personal chef for Yugoslav president [[Josip Broz Tito]]. Born in a village in the central Serbian region of [[Gruža (region)|Gruža]] in 1935, Stojanović lost both of his parents in the [[Kragujevac massacre]] of October 1941, and was later moved to an [[orphanage]]. As a teenager, he enrolled in a culinary school. He has come up with around 200 recipes over the course of his career, many of which were named after figures and locations from Serbian history. According to Stojanović, he first prepared Karađorđeva šnicla in 1956 or 1957, after receiving an order for [[Chicken Kiev]] while working at the Golf Restaurant in the Belgrade suburb of [[Košutnjak]]. Lacking butter and chicken, Stojanović decided to make a cutlet from [[veal]] and [[kaymak]], a creamy [[dairy product]] similar to [[clotted cream]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |last=Kalaba |first=Ana |date=9 March 2020 |title="Kako sam skuvao istoriju": Životna priča Titovog kuvara |trans-title="How I Cooked History": The Life Story of Tito's Chef |url=https://nova.rs/magazin/lifestyle/originalna-karadordeva-snicla-kuvar-tvorac/ |access-date=13 September 2024 |work=[[NOVA portal]] |language=sr |archive-date=10 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231210202725/https://nova.rs/magazin/lifestyle/originalna-karadordeva-snicla-kuvar-tvorac/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite news |last=Mitrović |first=Nemanja |date=19 February 2023 |title=Jugoslavija i hrana: Kako je Titov kuvar stvorio Karađorđevu šniclu |trans-title=Yugoslavia and food: How Tito's chef created Karađorđe's schnitzel |url=https://www.bbc.com/serbian/lat/balkan-64684198 |access-date=13 September 2024 |work=[[BBC News]] |language=sr |archive-date=17 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230317190630/https://www.bbc.com/serbian/lat/balkan-64684198 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Jaksic |first=Julia |last2=Moskin |first2=Julia |title=Kajmak With Herbs |url=https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013012-kajmak-with-herbs |access-date=18 September 2024 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> He finished by pouring [[tartar sauce]] over it and garnishing it with a lemon slice.<ref>{{Cite news |date=8 May 2010 |title=I car Dušan je voleo čorbe |trans-title=Emperor Dušan also loved soups |url=https://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/133715/%D0%98-%D1%86%D0%B0%D1%80-%D0%94%D1%83%D1%88%D0%B0%D0%BD-%D1%98%D0%B5-%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BE-%D1%87%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B5 |access-date=14 September 2024 |work=[[Politika]] |language=sr |archive-date=13 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240913233735/https://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/133715/%D0%98-%D1%86%D0%B0%D1%80-%D0%94%D1%83%D1%88%D0%B0%D0%BD-%D1%98%D0%B5-%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BE-%D1%87%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B5 |url-status=live }}</ref> He later discovered that the guest was Tito's sister-in-law Tamara Broz, who was pleased with the result.

== Preparation ==
The primary ingredients of Karađorđeva šnicla include [[steak]], [[breadcrumbs]], flour, oil, and eggs, while stuffing often includes kaymak.<ref name=":5" /><ref>{{Cite news |last=Krdžić |first=Iris |date=17 October 2022 |title=Uživajte u pravom srpskom ručku!

The Swiss [[Cordon bleu (dish)|cordon bleu]] has been compared as having similar preparation to Karađorđeva šnicla.<ref name=":1" /> In response to [[Voki Kostić]]'s claim that Karađorđeva šnicla is a copy of cordon bleu, the {{Ill|Belgrade Hospitality and Tourism School|sr|Ugostiteljsko-turistička škola Beograd|v=sup}} disputed his claim, citing differences in stuffing.<ref name=":5" /> Bojana Kalenjuk Pivarski, a professor at the Department of Gastronomy at the Faculty of Sciences of the [[University of Novi Sad]], similarly criticised the comparison of Karađorđeva šnicla to other dishes that are similar in preparation, such as chicken Kiev, due to its specific shape and stuffing characteristics, such as the use of kaymak.<ref name=":1" />

=== Variations ===
A ''[[Kurir]]'' recipe additionally lists onions as an ingredient and black pepper and [[Vegeta (condiment)|Vegeta]] as condiments. According to them, breadcrumbs are first mixed with meat and other ingredients, excluding flour and oil, then shaped into a rectangle. Cheese, [[prosciutto]], and kaymak are then added as a filling to the mixture, which is subsequently fried in oil.<ref name="Kurir" /> Another variation includes potatoes as a replacement for a steak. In this variation, potatoes are blended with eggs, flour, breadcrumbs, and stewed onions before being spread in the shape of a [[patty]]. Kaymak is then applied to the mixture and rolled, before being combined with breadcrumbs and eggs and fried.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Karađorđeva šnicla od krompira |trans-title=Karađorđe's potato schnitzel |url=https://recepti.zena.blic.rs/33900 |access-date=13 September 2024 |work=[[Blic Žena]] |language=sr |archive-date=15 April 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240415021913/https://recepti.zena.blic.rs/33900 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Stojanović's son has claimed that the Zagreb steak (''Zagrebački odrezak''), made in Croatia, and the Ljubljana schnitzel, made in Slovenia, are variations of Karađorđeva šnicla.<ref name=":7" /> The Zagreb steak is more commonly associated with the [[Wiener schnitzel]] and the cordon bleu, as it is filled with ham and cheese rather than kaymak.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Zagrebački odrezak |trans-title=Zagreb steak |url=https://croatia.hr/hr-hr/hrana-i-pice/zagrebacki-odrezak |access-date=13 September 2024 |website=[[Croatian National Tourist Board]] |language=hr |archive-date=13 September 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240913233739/https://croatia.hr/hr-hr/hrana-i-pice/zagrebacki-odrezak |url-status=live }}</ref>
