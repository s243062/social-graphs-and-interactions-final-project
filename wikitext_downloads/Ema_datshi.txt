== Etymology ==
The term "Ema datshi" originates from [[Dzongkha]], the official language of [[Bhutan]]. Ema datshi is written as "ཨེ་མ་དར་ཚིལ་" in [[Dzongkha]]. In the [[wylie transliteration]] system, "Ema datshi" is represented as "e-ma dar-tshil". In Dzongkha, "ema" translates to "chili" and "datshi" means "cheese." Therefore, "ema datshi" directly translates to "chili cheese" in English.<ref name="Geeta2">{{cite news |last=Pandey |first=Geeta |date=2005-03-04 |title=Bhutan's love affair with chillies |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4315155.stm |accessdate=4 October 2011 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref> "Ema" is pronounced similar to "ay-ma," with the emphasis on the first syllable. "Datshi" is pronounced as "da-chee," with a soft "ch" sound and emphasis on the second syllable.

== History ==
Ema datshi has its roots from the [[Tibetan cuisine]], which was gradually adapted and evolved according to their homegrown produce. Ema datshi is seen everywhere in Bhutan from home to restaurants.

Chilli was possibly brought to the country by Indian pilgrims in the later years.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Ramesh |first=Nisha |date=2023-05-08 |title=Ema Datshi |url=https://www.196flavors.com/ema-datshi/ |access-date=2024-03-27 |website=196 flavors |language=en-US}}</ref>
