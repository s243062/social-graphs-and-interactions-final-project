Tempura batter is traditionally mixed in small batches using [[chopsticks]] for only a few seconds, leaving lumps in the mixture that, along with the cold batter temperature, result in a unique fluffy and crisp tempura structure when cooked. The batter is often kept cold by adding ice or placing the bowl inside a larger bowl with ice. Overmixing the batter will activate wheat [[gluten]], which causes the flour mixture to become soft and dough-like when fried.

Specially formulated tempura flour is available in supermarkets. This is generally light (low-gluten) flour and occasionally contains leaveners such as baking powder.<ref name="STFCJ2015_flourTempura">{{Cite web |date=2017-12-20 |title=Standard tables of food composition in Japan 2015 (Seventh Revised Edition) |url=https://www.mext.go.jp/component/english/__icsFiles/afieldfile/2017/12/20/1385123_Notes-on-food_r11.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200219083450/https://www.mext.go.jp/component/english/__icsFiles/afieldfile/2017/12/20/1385123_Notes-on-food_r11.pdf |archive-date=2020-02-19 |access-date=2021-08-21 |website=[[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] of Japan |at=Chapter 3.1 Notes on Foods: PDF p 4/276 |language=en |quote="Premixed flour for Tempura" is a product made from soft flour, starch, baking powder, ... |orig-year=2015}}

The bits of batter (known as ''[[tenkasu]]'') are scooped out between batches of tempura so they do not burn and leave a bad flavor in the oil.<ref name="Kobayashi2000" /> A small mesh scoop (''[[ami jakushi]]'') is used for this purpose. ''Tenkasu'' are often reserved as ingredients in other dishes or as a topping.

===Serving and presentation===

[[File:Tempura and tentsuyu by cathykid in Taipei.jpg|thumb|[[Tentsuyu]] is the most common sauce consumed with tempura.]]

Cooked pieces of tempura are either eaten with dipping sauce, salted without sauce, or used to assemble other dishes. Tempura is commonly served with grated [[daikon]] and eaten hot immediately after frying. In Japan, it is often found in bowls of soba or udon soup in the form of shrimp, shiso leaf, or fritter.  The most common sauce is [[tentsuyu]] sauce (roughly three parts ''[[dashi]]'', one part ''[[mirin]]'', and one part [[soy sauce|''shōyu'']]). Alternatively, skim tempura may be sprinkled with [[sea salt]] before eating. Mixtures of [[Matcha|powdered green tea]] and salt or ''[[yuzu]]'' and salt are also used.<ref name="Japanese Soul Cooking">{{cite book |last1=Ono |first1=Tadashi |last2=Salat |first2=Harris |title=Japanese Soul Cooking: Ramen, Tonkatsu, Tempura, and More from the Streets and Kitchens of Tokyo and Beyond |date=2013 |publisher=Potter/Ten Speed/Harmony/Rodale |isbn=9781607743538 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mF4me5AKc-wC&q=tonkatsu&pg=PT306 |access-date=21 July 2020}}</ref>
''{{visible anchor|[[Kakiage]]}}'' is a type of tempura made with mixed vegetable strips, such as onion, carrot, and burdock, and sometimes including [[Shrimp and prawn as food|shrimp]] or [[Squid as food|squid]], which are deep fried as small round [[fritter]]s.

[[File:大洗マリンタワーかき揚げ丼.jpg|thumb|A tower-shaped kakiage bowl (temdon), a specialty of [[Ōarai, Ibaraki]]]]Tempura is also used in combination with other foods. When served over ''[[soba]]'' (buckwheat noodles), it is called ''tempura soba''<ref>{{cite news|title=Tempura Soba|url=https://asianinspirations.com.au/recipe/tempura-soba/|access-date=6 November 2015|agency=Asian Inspiretion|publisher=Authentic Recipe List}}</ref> or ''[[tensoba]]''. Tempura is also served as a ''[[donburi]]'' dish where tempura shrimp and vegetables are served over [[steamed rice]] in a bowl (''tendon'') and on top of ''[[udon]]'' soup (''tempura udon'').

===Origins===
Earlier Japanese deep-fried food was either simply fried without breading or batter or fried with rice flour.{{Citation needed|date=May 2024}}  However, toward the end of the 16th century, the technique of fritter-cooking with a batter of flour and eggs was acquired in [[Nagasaki]] by Portuguese missionaries.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nagasaki Tempura ｜ Our Regional Cuisines : MAFF |url=https://www.maff.go.jp/e/policies/market/k_ryouri/search_menu/4260/index.html |access-date=2024-05-10 |website=www.maff.go.jp}}</ref> [[Peixinhos da horta]] was a dish often eaten during [[Lent]] or [[Ember days]] to fulfill the [[Fasting and abstinence in the Catholic Church|fasting and abstinence rules for Catholics]].

As the batter already contained seasoning, it was eaten without dipping sauce.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The History of Tempura |url=https://guide.michelin.com/hk/en/article/features/tempura_en |access-date=2024-05-10 |website=MICHELIN Guide |language=en-HK}}</ref>

In the early 17th century, around the [[Tokyo Bay]] area, tempura ingredients and preparation changed as the ''[[Yatai (food cart)|yatai]]'' (food cart) culture gained popularity. Making the best use of fresh seafood while preserving its delicate taste, tempura used only flour, eggs, and water as ingredients, and the batter was not flavored.  As the batter was mixed minimally in cold water, it avoided the dough-like stickiness caused by the activation of wheat gluten, resulting in the crispy texture now characteristic of tempura. It became customary to dip tempura quickly in a sauce mixed with grated daikon just before eating it.

Today in Japan, mainstream tempura recipes originate from "Tokyo-style" (also known as “Edo-style“) tempura, invented at the food stalls along the riverside fish market in the Edo period.  Tempura became popular largely due to the abundance of seafood. In addition, as oil extraction techniques advanced, cooking oil became cheaper. Serving deep-fried food indoors was prohibited during Edo because tempura oil was a fire hazard in Japanese buildings, which were made of paper and wood. Therefore, tempura gained popularity as fast food eaten at outdoor food stalls. It was skewered and eaten with a dipping sauce.  Tempura is considered one of "the Edo Delicacies" along with [[soba]] (buckwheat noodles) and [[sushi]], which were also food stall take-outs.

The modern tempura recipe was first published in 1671 in the cookbook called "料理献立抄". After the Meiji period, tempura was no longer considered a fast-food item but developed as a high-class cuisine.

===Etymology===
{{Wiktionary}}
The word "tempura", or the technique of dipping fish and vegetables into a batter and frying them, comes from the word {{Lang|la|tempora}}, a Latin word meaning "times", "time period" used by Portuguese missionaries to refer to the [[Lent]]en period or [[Ember Days]] (''ad tempora quadragesima''), Fridays, and other Christian holy days. Ember Days, or ''{{Lang|la|quatuor anni tempora}}'' in Latin, refer to holy days when Catholics avoid meat and eat fish or vegetables instead.<ref>{{cite book|last=Narloch|first=Leandro|title=Guia Politicamente Incorreto da História do Mundo|year=2013|publisher=[[Editora Leya]]|location=São Paulo|isbn=9788580448405|page=163|edition=1|language=pt|chapter=Samurais}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author1=LUIS SÁNCHEZ-MOLINÍ |title="El haiku es muy parecido a la seguidilla, algo breve e impactante" |url=https://www.diariodesevilla.es/sevilla/haiku-parecido-seguidilla-breve-impactante_0_688431587.html |access-date=18 September 2021 |work=[[Diario de Sevilla]] |date=14 April 2013 |language=es |quote=Témporas are the Christian liturgical cycles corresponding to the end and beginning of the four seasons of the year, consecrated especially to prayer and penance.

The term "tempura" is thought to have gained popularity in southern Japan; it became widely used to refer to any food prepared using hot oil, including some already existing Japanese foods.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Today, particularly in western Japan, the word "tempura" is also commonly used to refer to ''[[satsuma-age]]'', fried surimi fish cake which is made without batter.<ref name="Ishige 2014 p246">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H0nXAwAAQBAJ&q=Tempura+Satsuma-age&pg=PA246|page=246|title=The History and Culture of Japanese Food|first=Naomichi |last=Ishige |author-link=:ja:石毛直道 |publisher= Routledge|year= 2014 | isbn=978-1136602559}}</ref><ref name = "Satsuma-age 2017 Names">{{cite web|url=https://news.livedoor.com/article/detail/13209051/|title=「さつま揚げ」の各都道府県での呼び名を調査 関西は「天ぷら」 |publisher=J-TOWN.NET |date=June 16, 2017 |access-date=March 23, 2020}}</ref>

==Variations==

===Japan===
In Japan, [[restaurant]]s specializing in tempura are called ''tenpura-ya''. Many restaurants offer tempura as part of a set meal or a ''[[bento]]'' (lunch box), and it is also a popular ingredient in take-out or convenience store ''bento'' boxes.  The ingredients and styles of cooking and serving tempura vary greatly throughout the country, with importance placed on using fresh, seasonal ingredients.

===Outside Japan===

Outside Japan (as well as recently in Japan), there are many nontraditional and [[fusion cuisine|fusion]] uses of tempura. Chefs all over the world include tempura dishes on their menus, and a wide variety of different batters and ingredients are used, including nontraditional [[broccoli]], [[zucchini]], [[asparagus]] and [[chayote|chuchu]]. More unusual ingredients may include [[nori]] slices, dry fruit such as [[banana]]s, and [[ice cream]] (''tempura''-based [[fried ice cream]]). [[United States|American]] restaurants are known to serve tempura in the form of various types of meat, particularly chicken and cheeses, usually [[mozzarella]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}} A variation is to use [[panko]] (breadcrumbs), which results in a crisper consistency than tempura batter, although in Japan this would be classified as a ''furai'' dish. Tempura (particularly shrimp) is often used as a filling in ''[[sushi|makizushi]]''. A more recent variation of tempura sushi has entire pieces of sushi dipped in batter and tempura-fried.

In [[Bangladesh]], the blossoms of pumpkins or [[Marrow (vegetable)|marrows]] are often deep-fried with a gram of rice flour spice mix, creating a Bengali-style tempura known as kumro ful bhaja.

====Taiwan====
In [[Taiwan]], tempura, as described in the preceding, is known as ''tiānfùluó'' ({{lang|zh-hant|天婦羅}}) and can commonly be found on the menu in Japanese restaurants all over the island. A similar-sounding dish, ''tianbula'' ({{lang-zh|c=甜不辣|p=tiánbùlà|l=sweet, not spicy}}) is usually sold at [[Night markets in Taiwan|night markets]]. Tianbula is Japanese [[satsuma-age]] and was introduced to [[Taiwan under Japanese rule]] by people from Kyushu, where satsuma-age is commonly known as ''tempura''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.koryu.or.jp/Portals/0/images/publications/magazine/2016/1/201601_04.pdf|title=片倉佳史の台湾歴史紀行 第一回 港湾都市・基隆を訪ねる|first=Yoshifumi |last=Katakura |author-link=:ja:片倉佳史 |publisher=[[Japan–Taiwan Exchange Association]] |date=2016 |access-date=March 23, 2020 |page=9}}</ref><ref name="Ishige 2014 p246" /><ref name = "Satsuma-age 2017 Names" />
