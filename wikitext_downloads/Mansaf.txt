==History==
Ancient [[Canaan]]ites used to make this food to celebrate the beginning of the season of spring, they mixed lamb meat with milk which was mentioned in the [[Torah]] and became forbidden in Judaism. The original pastoralist Bedouin mansaf underwent significant changes in the 20th century. The dish is said to originally have been made with simply meat (camel or lamb), meat broth or [[ghee]] (clarified butter) and bread.<ref name="Massad1998">{{cite book|author=Joseph Andoni Massad|author-link=Joseph Andoni Massad|title=Identifying the nation: the juridical and military bases of Jordanian national identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hsQwAQAAIAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Columbia University|page=233}}</ref> Following the popularization of rice in northern Transjordan in the 1920s, rice gradually was introduced into the dish, at first mixed with bulgur, and later on its own, until the dish reached its modern incarnation of being based on white rice. Similarly, the [[jameed]] sauce is a recent development, as the Bedouins did not historically feature jameed in their cooked dishes until their modern sedentarization.<ref name="Massad1"/>

==Preparation==
===Jameed===
[[File:Jameed.JPG|thumb|right|[[Al-Karak]] in Jordan is known to produce the highest quality of jameed.]]
{{See also|Jameed}}

[[Jameed]] is a hard dry [[yogurt]] that is prepared by the boiling of sheep or [[goat's milk]], which is then left to dry and ferment.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zG1H75z0EYYC|title=Food Cultures of the World Encyclopedia [4 volumes]: [Four Volumes]|last=Albala|first=Ken|date=2011-05-25|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313376276|language=en}}</ref> The mixture is later kept in a fine woven [[cheesecloth]] to make a thick yogurt. Salt is added daily to thicken the yogurt even more for a few days, which then becomes very dense and is shaped into round balls. The city of [[Al-Karak]] in Jordan has a reputation for producing the highest quality of jameed.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sonia Uvezian|title=Recipes and remembrances from an Eastern Mediterranean kitchen: a culinary journey through Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E2sgAQAAMAAJ|access-date=23 July 2012|year=2001|publisher=Siamanto Press|isbn=978-0-9709716-8-5}}</ref>

===Cooking===
A jameed broth is prepared and the pieces of lamb are cooked in it. The dish is served on a large platter with a layer of [[flatbread]] ([[Markook shrek|markook]] or [[saj bread|shrak]]) topped with rice and then meat, garnished with [[almonds]] and [[pine nuts]], and then the creamy jameed sauce is poured on top of the dish.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://addustour.com/15373/%C2%AB%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%AF+%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A%C2%BB+..+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%A9+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9+%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1+%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A9+%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%B3%D9%81+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%86%D9%8A.html|language=ar|access-date=2016-04-19|date=2009-04-28|work=Ad Dustour|title="الجميد الكركي" .. الخلطة السرية لانتشار شهرة المنسف الأردني|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007120819/https://addustour.com/15373/%C2%AB%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%AF+%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A%C2%BB+..+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%A9+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9+%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1+%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A9+%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%B3%D9%81+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%86%D9%8A.html|archive-date=2016-10-07|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Abu-Jaber |first1=Diana |title=For Many Members of the Arab American Diaspora, Mansaf Offers a Taste of Home (Published 2021) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/11/t-magazine/mansaf-bedouin-rice.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=17 April 2025 |language=en |date=11 November 2021}}</ref> Jordanian mansaf typically includes a blend of spices and wild herbs called ''hwajeh'' ({{langx|ar|حواجة}}).<ref>{{cite news |title="المنسف".. طبق أردني وتراث عالمي |url=https://www.aa.com.tr/ar/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%86/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%B3%D9%81-%D8%B7%D8%A8%D9%82-%D8%A3%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%86%D9%8A-%D9%88%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AB-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A-%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1/2770831 |access-date=26 November 2025 |work=Anadolu Agency |language=ar |trans-title="Mansaf"... a Jordanian dish and a global heritage}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Hwajet - Arca del Gusto |url=https://www.fondazioneslowfood.com/en/ark-of-taste-slow-food/hwajeh-arab/ |website=[[Slow Food Foundation]] |access-date=26 November 2025}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Samneh Baladieh Balqawieh - Arca del Gusto |url=https://www.fondazioneslowfood.com/en/ark-of-taste-slow-food/samen-baladi/ |website=Slow Food Foundation |access-date=26 November 2025}}</ref>

==Culture and tradition==
[[File:Préparation du mansaf-Jordanie (6).jpg|right|thumb|Woman in Petra preparing mansaf with lamb and chicken]]

Mansaf is associated with a traditional Jordanian culture based on an agro-pastoral lifestyle in which meat and yogurt are readily available. Mansaf is served on special occasions such as weddings, births and graduations, or to honor a guest, and on major holidays such as [[Eid ul-Fitr]], [[Eid ul-Adha]], [[Christmas]], [[Easter]] and [[Independence Day (Jordan)|Jordan's Independence Day]]. It is traditionally eaten collectively from a large platter in the [[Bedouin]] and rural style, standing around the platter with the left hand behind the back and using the right hand instead of utensils.<ref>''The cultural history of Jordan during the Mamluk period 1250–1517'', [[Yousef Ghawanmeh]]</ref> Mansaf plays an active role in settling tribal disputes in Jordan in what is known as an ''Atwa'' (truce) and a ''Ja'ha'' (peacemaking process).<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Furr|first1=Ann|last2=Al-Serhan|date=2008|title=Tribal Customary Law in Jordan|url=https://scholarcommons.sc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1055&context=scjilb|journal=South Carolina Journal of International Law and Business|volume=4|pages=17–34|via=Scholar Commons}}</ref>  It is thought to signal the end of a conflict when the heads of conflicting tribes visit each other and the host sacrifices a sheep or a goat for a shared mansaf, taken to be a sign of reconciliation.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Mansaf|url=https://www.tasteatlas.com/mansaf|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=Taste Atlas}}</ref>

Since mansaf was originally popular among Bedouins, much of the traditions that they used with the dish still exist today. The tray containing mansaf is placed on a table where people gather around it while standing. Mansaf should be eaten with the use of a person's right hand only while the left is behind the person's back. The hand is used to create balls of rice and then the ball is placed in the mouth through the use of three fingers. It is frowned upon to blow on the ball of rice, no matter how hot. Many of these traditions are still used; however, it can also be eaten with spoons and plates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.alaraby.co.uk/miscellaneous/2016/2/13/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%B3%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%B6%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B3-%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%A1|title=المنسف الأردني.. حاضر في الأعراس وسرادق العزاء|access-date=2016-04-19|date=2016-02-13|work=Al Araby|language=ar}}</ref>

===Jordan's national dish===
Though mansaf is frequently referred to as Jordan's "national dish", Palestinian Professor of Modern Arab Politics and Intellectual History at Columbia University [[Joseph Massad]] states that mansaf is not a truly "traditional" dish, but is rather a more recent dish which was developed during the [[Emirate of Transjordan|Hashemite-Mandatory]] era of the early 20th century, and then promulgated as a national dish following [[Independence of Jordan|independence]]. Massad notes that the current form of mansaf differs from the independence-era and Mandate-era recipes but is portrayed by the state as a dish that is both national and a Bedouin tradition,<ref name="Massad1">{{cite book|author=Joseph Andoni Massad |title=Colonial Effects: The Making of National Identity in Jordan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZiZFx42ZylAC&pg=PA316 |access-date=23 July 2012 |year=2001 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-12323-5 |pages=316–}}</ref> despite it also historically being a dish of the peasants and Bedouins of the neighboring regions of southern Palestine and Syria.<ref name="Massad">{{cite book|author=Joseph Massad|title=Identifying the nation: the juridical and military bases of Jordanian national identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hsQwAQAAIAAJ| access-date=23 July 2012|year=1998|publisher=Columbia University|page=233}}</ref><ref name="Heacock2008">{{cite book|author=Roger Heacock|title=Temps et espaces en Palestine: flux et résistances identitaires|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F6UvAQAAIAAJ|year=2008|publisher=Institut français du Proche-Orient|isbn=978-2-35159-074-4|page=289}}</ref>

==Regions and variants==
[[File:Préparation du mansaf-Jordanie (8).jpg|thumb|right|A variant of mansaf topped with parsley]] 
The inhabitants of [[Al-Salt]] and [[Al-Karak]] are reputed to make the best mansaf in Jordan. In Palestine, Mansaf is the main dish of the central and southern areas of the [[West Bank]] and the [[Negev Bedouin|Negev]] desert.  Other variants of the dish also exist and are adapted to the regional tastes and circumstances. These include fish mansaf, found in the south around the port city of [[Aqaba]]. An urban, less ceremonial adaptation of mansaf using non-dried yogurt is called ''shakreyyeh'' or ''laban emmo''. It is sometimes cooked with poultry instead of lamb and is common in Palestine, Lebanon, Syria and the northern part of Jordan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.addustour.com/16335/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%B3%D9%81..%20%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%AF%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%85%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A.html|language=ar|title=المنسف.. سيد الطعام العربي|access-date=2016-04-20|date=2011-12-16|work=Ad Dustour|archive-date=2016-10-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007144248/http://www.addustour.com/16335/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%B3%D9%81..%20%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%AF%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%85%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the 2020s, a restaurateur in [[Amman]] began selling single servings of mansaf in cups.

== Evolution ==

=== Evolution in the dish ===
Prior to 1945, mansaf was made up of three main components: the bread, the meat and the clarified butter. The bread that was used is called [[Shrak bread|khobz al-shrak]]. It is a whole wheat bread that is described as "thick", "flat", "paper-thin" and "crumb-less".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Dursteler |first=Eric R. |date=2014 |title=Bad Bread and the 'Outrageous Drunkenness of the Turks': Food and Identity in the Accounts of Early Modern European Travelers to the Ottoman Empire |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/jwh.2014.0023 |journal=Journal of World History |volume=25 |issue=2–3 |pages=203–228 |doi=10.1353/jwh.2014.0023 |s2cid=143929097 |issn=1527-8050|url-access=subscription }}</ref> Mansaf was made using whole wheat flour because wheat was an easily accessible crop at the time. The specific type of bread varied based on local regions.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Wojnarowski |first1=Frederick |last2=Williams |first2=Jennifer |date=2020-07-02 |title=Making mansaf: the interplay of identity and political economy in Jordan's 'national dish' |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/20581831.2020.1767325 |journal=Contemporary Levant |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=161–177 |doi=10.1080/20581831.2020.1767325 |s2cid=219738803 |issn=2058-1831|url-access=subscription }}</ref> The next main component of mansaf was the meat. It was boiled in water in order to clean it from dirt and film that developed on its surface. After the meat was fully cooked, it was added on top of the bread, and the meat broth was poured over the bread. The final step was pouring the clarified butter, called samin beladee, on top.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Alobiedat |first=Ammar |date=2016-04-21 |title=The Sociocultural and Economic Evolution of Mansaf in Hartha, Northern Jordan |journal=Humanities |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=22 |doi=10.3390/h5020022 |issn=2076-0787|doi-access=free }}</ref>

The first evolutions to change this initial recipe were a decrease in the amount of broth added to the base, and adding [[bulgur]] wheat to the meal. This is because bulgur became a widely grown crop around 1945. The wheat was cleaned, boiled, then spread on a clean surface and left to dry in the sun for a few days. Once the drying process was complete, the wheat was ground up, which is what turns it into bulgur wheat. Finally, the bulgur wheat was cooked similar to how rice is cooked today.<ref name=":0" />

Around the 1950s, replacing bulgur wheat with rice started to rise in popularity when making mansaf, due to the proximity of a city in Jordan called Hartha to Syrian and Palestinian borders. This resulted in better access to trade networks.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Howell |first=Sally |date=2003-10-01 |title=Modernizing Mansaf: The Consuming Contexts of Jordan's National Dish |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/713926376 |journal=Food and Foodways |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=215–243 |doi=10.1080/713926376 |s2cid=144898777 |issn=0740-9710|url-access=subscription }}</ref>

In the early 1960s, new toppings were introduced to the recipe of mansaf. Those include roasted almonds and pine nuts. A few years after that, the clarified butter and the broth were replaced with [[jameed]], which is a yogurt sauce. People also started cooking the meat in this yogurt sauce, which resulted in a more "robust flavor" which marinated the meat during the cooking process.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Hilali |first1=M. |last2=El-Mayda |first2=E. |last3=Rischkowsky |first3=B. |date=2011-11-01 |title=Characteristics and utilization of sheep and goat milk in the Middle East |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921448811003786 |journal=Small Ruminant Research |language=en |volume=101 |issue=1: Special Issue: Products from Small Ruminants |pages=92–101 |doi=10.1016/j.smallrumres.2011.09.029 |issn=0921-4488|url-access=subscription }}</ref>

=== Evolution in the preparation process ===
[[File:Family_mansaf.jpg|thumb|A Jordanian family enjoying mansaf for lunch.]]
Prior to the 1970s, mansaf was cooked in a large copper cauldron that was placed over a fire in the courtyards of one's home. The cauldron was so large that people had no choice but to cook the dish outdoors. Once the ingredients were fully cooked, they would be placed on a large copper platter and carried indoors.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Shunnaq |first1=Mohammed |last2=Ramadan |first2=Susanne |last3=Young |first3=William C. |date=2021-07-13 |title=National meal or tribal feasting dish?

After the 1970s, many changes occurred to the original recipe and preparation of mansaf. The bread was replaced with rice, and the platter used for the mansaf changed from traditional copper to a florally decorated enamelware or aluminum platter.<ref name=":0" /> These changes happened due to advancements in technology, which made it possible for mansaf to be cooked indoors, in smaller amounts for smaller groups of people like families.<ref name=":0"/>
