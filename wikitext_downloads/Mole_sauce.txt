'''Mole''' ({{IPA|es|ˈmole|lang}}; from [[Nahuatl]] ''mōlli'', {{IPA|nah|ˈmoːlːi|pron}}; {{literally|sauce}}) is a traditional sauce and marinade originally used in [[Mexican cuisine]]. In contemporary Mexico the term is used for a number of sauces, some quite dissimilar, including ''mole amarillo'' or ''amarillito'' (yellow mole), ''mole chichilo'', ''mole colorado'' or ''coloradito'' (reddish mole), ''mole manchamantel'' or ''manchamanteles'' (tablecloth stainer), ''mole negro'' (black mole), ''mole rojo'' (red mole), ''mole verde'' (green mole), ''[[Mole_(sauce)#Puebla|mole poblano]]'', ''mole almendrado'' (mole with [[almond]]), ''mole michoacano'', ''mole prieto'', ''mole ranchero'', ''mole tamaulipeco'', ''mole xiqueno'', ''[[Pipián (sauce)|pipián]]'' (mole with [[squash seed]]), ''mole rosa'' (pink mole), ''mole blanco'' (white mole), ''mole estofado'', ''tezmole'', ''clemole'', ''mole de'' olla, chimole, [[guacamole]] (mole with [[avocado]]) and ''huaxmole'' (mole with [[Leucaena leucocephala|huaje]]).

The spelling {{Typo|''molé''}}, often seen on English-language menus, is a [[hyperforeignism]] and not used in Spanish, but likely intended to distinguish the sauce from the English word for the animal [[Mole (animal)|mole]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mole Sauce -- Mexican Sauces |url=https://www.scienceofcooking.com/food-encyclopedia/mole_sauce.htm#:~:text=The%20accented%20form%20mol%C3%A9,%20occasionally,known%20burrowing%20mammal,%20the%20mole. |access-date=2025-05-20 |website=www.scienceofcooking.com}}</ref>

Generally, a mole sauce contains fruits, nuts, chili peppers, and spices like [[black pepper]], [[cinnamon]], or [[cumin]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=What Is Mole? |url=https://www.foodnetwork.com/how-to/packages/food-network-essentials/what-is-mole |access-date=2023-07-26 |website=Food Network |language=en}}</ref> 

Pre-Hispanic Mexico showcases chocolate's complex role, primarily as a beverage rather than a confection. Although modern culinary practices emphasize its versatility, historical evidence indicates chocolate's earlier use in sacred rituals and as currency. It was much later that chocolate was added to mole.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Nosowitz |first=Dan |date=December 3, 2024 |title=Everything You Know About Mole Sauce Is A Lie: If what you know is that mole’s most important ingredient is chocolate. |url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/everything-you-know-about-mole-sauce-is-a-lie |website=Atlas Obscura}}</ref>

While not moles in the classic sense, there are some dishes that use the term in their name.

Moles come in various flavors and ingredients, with chili peppers as the common ingredient. The classic mole version is the variety called mole poblano, which is a dark red or brown sauce served over meat. The dish has become a culinary symbol of Mexico's [[mestizaje]], or mixed indigenous and European heritage, both for the types of ingredients it contains and because of the legends surrounding its origin.

A common legend of its creation takes place at the Convent of Santa Clara in Puebla early in the colonial period. Upon hearing that the archbishop was going to visit, the convent nuns panicked because they were poor and had almost nothing to prepare. The nuns prayed and brought together the little bits of what they did have, including nuts, chili peppers, spices, day-old bread and a little [[chocolate]]. They killed an old [[turkey (bird)|turkey]], cooked it and put the sauce on top; the archbishop loved it. When one of the nuns was asked the name of the dish, she replied, "I made a mole." Mole is an archaic word for mix; now this word mostly refers to the dish, and is rarely used to signify other kinds of mixes in Spanish.<ref name="holymole">{{cite news |title= Holy Mole |url= https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2008/mar/19/holymole |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=March 19, 2008 |access-date=August 20, 2010 | first=Phil | last=Hall}}</ref>

A similar version of the story says that monk Fray Pascual invented the dish, again to serve the archbishop of Puebla. In this version, spice containers were knocked or blown over so that their contents spilled into pots in which chicken was cooking.<ref name="mexonline">{{cite web |url=http://www.mexonline.com/molepoblano.htm |title= Mole Poblano: Mexico's National Food Dish |publisher=MexOnline |access-date=August 20, 2010 }}</ref> Other versions of the story substitute the [[viceroy]] of [[New Spain]], such as [[Juan de Palafox y Mendoza]] in place of the archbishop.<ref name="kbautista">{{cite news |first=Karla |last=Bautista S. |title=Mole de San Pedro Atocpan tradición ancestral de México |url=http://www.oem.com.mx/elsoldecuautla/notas/n625711.htm |publisher=El Sol de Cuautla |location=Cuautla, Morelos |date=2008-03-12 |access-date=May 30, 2009 |language=es |archive-date=2011-11-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125191627/http://www.oem.com.mx/elsoldecuautla/notas/n625711.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The resulting powder or paste is mixed with water, or more often broth, and simmered until it is pungent and very thick. It is most often prepared in a [[cazuela]] ({{IPA|es|kaˈswela}}) or a thick heavy clay cauldron and stirred almost constantly to prevent burning. The thickness of the sauce has prompted some, such as Mexican-food authority [[Patricia Quintana]], to claim it is too substantial to be called a sauce. However, like a sauce, it is always served over something and never eaten alone. Mole poblano is most traditionally served with turkey, but it and many others are also served with chicken, [[pork]], or other meat (such as [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]]).

A number of mole powders and pastes can be prepared ahead of time and sold, such as mole poblano, mole negro, and mole colorado. Many markets in Mexico, as well as grocery stores, supermarkets, and online retailers internationally, sell mole pastes and powders in packages or by the kilogram.<ref name="theculturetrip.com">{{cite web |url=https://theculturetrip.com/north-america/mexico/articles/a-mole-tour-of-mexico-city-buying-cooking-eating/ |title=A Mole Tour of Mexico City: Buying, Cooking, Eating |date=26 August 2017 }}</ref><ref name="latimes.com">{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/food/story/2020-01-10/mole-paste-tips |title=LA Times Editorial: There's no shame in making mole from premade pastes.

Prepared mole sauce will keep for about three days in the refrigerator and it freezes well. The paste will keep six months in the refrigerator and about a year in the freezer. Leftover sauce is often used for the making of [[tamale]] and [[enchilada]] (often called enmolada) or over egg at brunch.

== Varieties ==

=== Mole verde (green mole) ===
[[File:Mole verde.jpg|thumb|A rich [[mole verde|green mole]] with [[Mexican rice|arroz rojo]]]]

====San Pedro Atocpan, Mexico City====
[[San Pedro Atocpan]] is an agricultural community in the mountains south of [[Mexico City]]. Until the mid-20th century it was similar to those surrounding it, growing [[corn]], [[Vicia faba|fava bean]] and [[nopal]] (prickly pear cactus). Electricity and other modern conveniences were slow to arrive, allowing the community to retain more of its traditions longer.
In 1940, Father Damian Sartes San Roman came to the parish of San Pedro Atocpan and saw the potential in marketing mole to raise living standards in the area. At that time, only four neighborhoods prepared mole for town festivals: Panchimalco, Ocotitla, Nuztla and Tula, but those who prepared it were generally prominent women in their communities. In the 1940s, one family made the long trek to Mexico City proper to sell some of their mole at the [[La Merced Market, Mexico City|La Merced Market]]. It was successful, but they brought with them only two kilograms since it was made by hand grinding the ingredients on a [[metate]].<ref name="32aniv">{{cite web |title=Mole almendrado un platillo que transformó la vida de un pueblo. |url=http://www.feriadelmole.com/atocpan.htm |access-date=May 30, 2009 |language=es |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008121748/http://www.feriadelmole.com/atocpan.htm |archive-date=October 8, 2009 }}</ref> The arrival of electricity in the late 1940s made the use of a powered mill possible, and better roads made the trek to the city easier. Some of these mills were bought or financed by Father Sartes, but the mole was still cooked in a clay pot over a wood fire. In the 1970s, he was part of a small group which became a cooperative, which constructed the Las Cazuelas restaurant. This is where the first Mole Exhibition was held in 1978.

The care and tradition that went into the moles from there made them popular and made the town famous in the Mexico City area. Today, San Pedro Atocpan produces 60% of the moles consumed in Mexico and 89% of the moles consumed in Mexico City, with a total estimated production of between 28,000 and 30,000 tons each year. Ninety-two percent of the town's population makes a living preparing mole powders and pastes, all in family businesses. Prices for mole run between 80 and 160 pesos per kilogram, depending on the maker and the type. A number of moles are made in the town, but mole almendrado is signature to the area. Producers in Atocpan have their own versions of the various types of mole, often keeping recipes strictly secret. The production in the town has become very competitive, especially in quality. Twenty-two brands are permitted to print "Made in San Pedro Atocpan" on their labels.

The consumption of mole is strongly associated with celebrations. In Mexico, to say "to go to a mole" ({{lang|es|ir a un mole}}) means to go to a wedding. Mole has a strong flavor, especially the dark ones and is considered to be an acquired taste for most. This has spawned another saying, "(estar) en su mero mole", which means something like "one's cup of tea" or “to be in one’s element”.

To promote their regional versions of the sauce, a number of places host festivals dedicated to it. The Feria Nacional del Mole (National Festival of Mole) was begun in 1977 in San Pedro Atocpan, and is held each year in October. It began outside the town, in the small community of Yenhuitlalpan, in May. The four restaurants there decided to take advantage of the festival of the Señor de las Misericordias (Lord of the Mercies) to promote their moles. Despite their success, a number in the village did not like that they were using a religious festival for commercial ends, so a separate mole festival was created for October.  Today, 37 restaurants and mole producers participate in the event. The most popular variety is the mole almendrado. Originally, the October version of the fair was held in the town proper, but after it became too big, it was moved to prepared fairgrounds outside along the highway.

The city of Puebla also holds an annual mole festival, whose proceeds are shared among the Santa Rosa, Santa Inés and Santa Catarina convents. The world's record for the largest pot of mole was broken at the city's 2005 festival. The pot was 1.4 meters in diameter at the base, 1.9 meters high, with a diameter of 2.5 meters at the top. Four hundred people participated in its preparation, using 800 kilos of mole paste, 2,500 kilos of chicken, 500 kilos of tortilla and 1,600 kilos of broth. The resulting food fed 11,000 people.

The women of Santa María Magdalena in [[Querétaro]] have been locally known for their mole for about 100 years. In 1993, they decided to hold a contest for the best mole.  This was the beginning of the Feria del Mole y Tortilla (Mole and Tortilla Festival), which has been held every year since then. It still features a mole cook-off and attracts hundreds of visitors from the state. The community of Coatepec de Morelos in the municipality of [[Zitácuaro]], [[Michoacán]], holds an annual Feria de Mole in April.<ref name="sanpancho">{{cite web |url= http://www.turismomichoacan.gob.mx/d_evento.php?id_evento=424 |title=11va.
