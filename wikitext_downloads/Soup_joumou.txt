'''Soup Joumou''' ({{IPAc-en|dʒ|uː|m|uː}}; {{langx|fr|soupe au giraumon}}, lit. ‘pumpkin soup’) is a [[soup]] native to [[Haitian cuisine]] made from squash, beef, and a mix of vegetables and spices. This hearty soup is not only a culinary delight but also a symbol of Haitian independence, traditionally consumed on January 1st to celebrate the country's liberation from French colonial rule in 1804. The dish is renowned for its rich, comforting flavor and vibrant color, making it a beloved staple in Haitian cuisine. While the main ingredients typically include squash, beef, and vegetables like carrots, potatoes, and turnips, variations exist, adding to its widespread appeal and regional adaptations.

== Background and historical significance ==
The dish gets its name ‘pumpkin soup’ from the main ingredient squash. When Haiti was colonized by France in the 1600s and 1700s, enslaved Africans were forced to cultivate the squash that forms the base of the beef soup known as joumou, which means squash or pumpkin in Creole.  Due to trade practices, pumpkin was shipped abroad or consumed by the property owning landed class, the African and Indigenous Haitian population toiling on plantations were forbidden from eating it themselves.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Chrisphonte |first=Jenna |title=Soupe joumou, a symbol of freedom and hope, is a New Year's Day tradition for Haitians everywhere |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2020/12/22/haitian-soupe-joumou-recipe/ |access-date=2020-12-30 |newspaper=Washington Post |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Trouillot |first=Lyonel |date=2022-01-01 |title=Haiti's New Year's Day soup has made headlines.

== Preparation ==
The soup is traditionally cooked with [[Winter squash|winter squashes]] such as the [[turban squash]]. The meat is marinated and simmered in a saucepan until tender while the squash is cooked, and pureed, often using a blender or food processor, to create a smooth, thick consistency. This pureed squash is then added to the simmering broth and meat mixture along with pieces of [[beef]] and soup bones, [[potato]], and [[Vegetable|vegetables]] such as [[Xanthosoma sagittifolium|malanga]], [[Leek|leeks]], [[celery]], [[Radish|radishes]], [[Carrot|carrots]], [[Cabbage|green cabbage]], [[Habanero|habanero pepper]] and [[Onion|onions]]. [[Epis]], [[salt]], and [[seasoning]] along with lime juice, [[garlic]], [[parsley]] and other [[Herb|herbs]] and [[Spice|spices]] are then added. Some Haitians add thin [[pasta]] such as [[vermicelli]] and [[macaroni]] and a small amount of [[butter]] or oil. The soup is always served hot and is usually accompanied by sliced French bread which is dipped in the soup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.food.com/recipe/soupe-joumou-haitian-pumpkin-soup-soupe-au-giramoun-204430 |title=Soupe Joumou (Haitian Pumpkin Soup) |date= |accessdate=1 January 2014}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://visithaiti.com/featured/soup-joumou/|title=Soup Joumou - the taste of freedom · Visit Haiti|date=2018-12-02|website=Visit Haiti|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.wlrn.org/post/soup-joumou-haitian-new-year-tradition-reminder-slave-led-revolution|title=Soup Joumou: A Haitian New Year Tradition, A Reminder Of A Slave Led Revolution|last=Green|first=Nadege|website=www.wlrn.org|language=en|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref>
