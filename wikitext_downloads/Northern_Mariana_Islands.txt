==History==
The islands were settled around 1500 BCE when various peoples migrated there. Eventually, the islands were claimed by [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] in 1521.<ref name="CIA Factbook"/> In the 18th century, the people of the northern Marianas were forced by Spain to relocate, and when they returned, new peoples migrated there. In 1899 Spain sold the Northern Marianas to [[German colonial empire|Germany]] in the [[German–Spanish Treaty (1899)|Spanish-German Treaty of 1899]], while Guam went to the United States. At the end of World War I, with the defeat of Germany, the islands became a part of the Japanese Mandate under the League of Nations, starting in 1918. The islands were liberated from the Japanese in the [[Battle of Saipan]] in 1944, and after the war, became part of the UN Trust Territory called the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI). Over the decades, integration with Guam was rejected, and eventually, the islands left the TTPI and became a part of the US in 1986. The Northern Marianas then became the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) and its residents are US citizens. In 2009, they elected a non-voting delegate to the US Congress.<ref name="CIA Factbook" />

===Arrival of humans===
{{Main|Mariana Islands#Prehistory}}
[[File:ChugaiCaveTurtles.jpg|thumb|left|Pictograms of sea turtles in Chugai' cave on Rota]]
The Mariana Islands were the first islands settled by humans in [[Remote Oceania]]. Incidentally, their settlement was the first and longest of the ocean-crossing voyages of the [[Austronesian peoples]], separate from the later [[Polynesian people|Polynesian]] settlement of the rest of Remote Oceania. The islands were first settled around 1500 to 1400 BC by people from the [[Philippines]]. This was followed by a second migration from the [[Caroline Islands]] by the first millennium AD, and a third migration from [[Island Southeast Asia]] (likely the Philippines or eastern [[Indonesia]]) by 900 AD.<ref name="Hung">{{cite journal |last1=Hung |first1=Hsiao-chun |last2=Carson |first2=Mike T. |last3=Bellwood |first3=Peter |last4=Campos |first4=Fredeliza Z. |last5=Piper |first5=Philip J. |last6=Dizon |first6=Eusebio |last7=Bolunia |first7=Mary Jane Louise A. |last8=Oxenham |first8=Marc |last9=Chi |first9=Zhang |title=The first settlement of Remote Oceania: the Philippines to the Marianas |journal=Antiquity |date=2015 |volume=85 |issue=329 |pages=909–926 |doi=10.1017/S0003598X00068393|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name="Zotomayor">{{cite journal |last1=Zotomayor |first1=Alexie Villegas |title=Archaeologists say migration to Marianas longest ocean-crossing in human history |journal=Marianas Variety News and Views |date=March 12, 2013 |page=2 |url=https://issuu.com/aleksea/docs/mv_3-12-13/2 |access-date=October 25, 2020 |archive-date=October 21, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221021085833/https://issuu.com/aleksea/docs/mv_3-12-13/2 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

After their first contact with Spaniards, the islanders eventually became known as the [[Chamorro people|Chamorros]], a Spanish word similar to ''Chamori'', the name of the Indigenous caste system's higher division.

The ancient people of the Marianas raised [[colonnade]]s of megalithic-capped pillars called [[latte stone]]s upon which they built their homes. The Spanish reported that by their arrival, the largest of these was already in ruins and that the Chamorros believed the ancestors who had erected the pillars lived in an era when people possessed supernatural abilities.

In 2013 archaeologists posited that the first people to settle in the Marianas may have made what was at that point the longest uninterrupted ocean-crossing voyage in human history. [[archaeology|Archeological evidence]] indicates that [[Tinian]] may have been the first Pacific island to be settled.<ref name=voyage>{{cite news|last1=Zotomayor|first1=Alexie|title=Archaeologist says migration to Marianas longest ocean-crossing in human history|url=http://www.mvariety.com/cnmi/cnmi-news/local/54274-archaeologist-says-migration-to-marianas-longest-ocean-crossing-in-human-history|access-date=December 29, 2014|newspaper=Marianas Variety|date=March 11, 2013}}</ref>

The Portuguese navigator [[Ferdinand Magellan]], sailing under the Spanish flag, arrived in 1521. He and his crew were the first Europeans to arrive in the Mariana Islands. He landed on Guam, the southernmost island of the Marianas, and claimed the archipelago for Spain. The Spanish ships were met offshore by the native Chamorros, who delivered refreshments and then helped themselves to a small boat belonging to Magellan's fleet. This led to a cultural clash: in Chamorro tradition, little property was private, and taking something one needed, such as a boat for fishing, did not count as stealing. The Spanish did not understand this custom and fought the Chamorros until the boat was recovered. Three days after he had been welcomed on his arrival, Magellan fled the archipelago. Spain regarded the islands as annexed and later made them part of the [[Spanish East Indies]] in 1565. In 1734, the Spanish built a royal palace, the [[Plaza de España (Hagåtña)|Plaza de España]], in Guam for the governor of the islands. The palace was largely destroyed during World War II, but portions of it remain.

Guam operated as an important stopover between the Philippines and [[Mexico]] for the [[Manila galleon]], which carried trading between Spanish colonies.

In 1668, Father [[Diego Luis de San Vitores]] renamed the islands ''Las Marianas'' in honor of his patroness, the Spanish regent [[Mariana of Austria]] (1634–1696), widow of [[Philip IV of Spain|Felipe IV]] (reigned 1621–1665).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://governor.gov.mp/about-the-cnmi/|title=About the CNMI|access-date=November 5, 2020|website=Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Office of the Governor|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200817114911/https://governor.gov.mp/about-the-cnmi/|archive-date=August 17, 2020|url-status=live|quote=In 1668, 147 years after Magellan's encounter, Fr. Diego Luis de San Vitores, a Jesuit priest, arrived in The Marianas with the mission of bringing Christianity and converting the Chamorros, thus beginning the colonization of the Marianas by Spain. The islands were named after Queen Maria Ana of Spain.}}</ref>

Most of the islands' native population (90–95%)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.everyculture.com/No-Sa/Commonwealth-of-the-Northern-Mariana-Islands.html/ |title=Culture of Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands |publisher=EveryCulture.com |access-date=September 17, 2007}}</ref> died from European diseases carried by the Spaniards or married non-Chamorro settlers under Spanish rule. New settlers from the Philippines and the Caroline Islands were brought to repopulate the islands. The Chamorro population gradually recovered, and Chamorro, [[Filipino language|Filipino]], and [[Carolinian language|Refaluwasch]] languages and other ethnic groups remain in the Marianas.

During the 17th century, Spanish colonists forcibly moved the Chamorros to Guam, to encourage assimilation and conversion to [[Roman Catholicism]]. By the time they were allowed to return to the Northern Marianas, many Carolinians from present-day eastern [[Yap State]] and western [[Chuuk State]] had settled in the Marianas.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Both languages, as well as English, are now official in the commonwealth.

In 1720 the Spanish moved the remaining islanders, whose population had been decimated by diseases, from the Marianas to Guam.<ref name="Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands">{{Cite web |title=Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) and Guam – Pacific Islands Benthic Habitat Mapping Center |url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/pibhmc/cms/data-by-location/cnmi-guam/ |access-date=October 21, 2023 |language=en-US}}</ref> By 1741, there were about 5000 remaining Chamorros.<ref name="Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands"/>

====Carolinian immigration====
The Northern Marianas experienced an influx of immigration from the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]] (Micronesia region) during the 19th century. Both this Carolinian sub-ethnicity and Carolinians in the Carolines archipelago [[endonym|refer to themselves]] as the [[Refaluwasch]]. The indigenous Chamorro word for the same group of people is ''gu'palao''. They are usually referred to simply as "Carolinians", though, unlike the other two monikers, this can also mean those who live in the Carolines and may have no affiliation with the Marianas.

The conquering Spanish did not focus attempts at cultural suppression against Carolinian immigrants, whose immigration they allowed during a period when the indigenous Chamorro majority was being subjugated with land alienation and forced relocations. Carolinians in the Marianas continue to be fluent in the [[Carolinian language]] and have maintained many of the cultural distinctions and traditions of their ethnicity's land of ancestral origin.<ref name=Cunningham1>

Early in [[World War I]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] declared war on Germany and invaded the Northern Marianas. In 1919 after the war concluded, the [[League of Nations]] (LoN) awarded all of Germany's islands in the Pacific Ocean located north of the [[Equator]], including the Northern Marianas, under [[League of Nations mandate|mandate]] to Japan. Under this arrangement, the Japanese thus administered the Northern Marianas as part of the [[South Seas Mandate]]. During the Japanese period, [[sugar cane]] became the primary industry of the islands. [[Garapan]] on [[Saipan]] was developed as a regional capital, and numerous Japanese (including ethnic Koreans and [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]]n and [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]]) migrated to the islands. In the December 1939 census, the total population of the South Seas Mandate was 129,104, of whom 77,257 were Japanese (including ethnic Taiwanese and Koreans). On Saipan, the pre-war population comprised 29,348 Japanese settlers and 3,926 Chamorro and Caroline Islanders; [[Tinian]] had 15,700 Japanese settlers (including 2,700 ethnic Koreans and 22 ethnic Chamorro). The Japanese built military constructions on the island in the 1930s and, in December 1941, used it as a staging area to invade Guam, which was part of the U.S. at that time.

During the Japanese mandate, the main economic focus was sugar production, and for example, about 98% of Tinian island was used to grow [[sugarcane]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |first=Lawerence |last=Duponcheel |department=Letters to the Editor |date=May 4, 2015 |title=Tinian's 'growing' role in Marianas history |url=https://www.postguam.com/opinion/letters_to_the_editor/tinian-s-growing-role-in-marianas-history/article_acf81646-ca05-52c8-bd2c-4f861d5bb14a.html |access-date=October 24, 2023 |website=The Guam Daily Post |language=en}}</ref>

On December 8, 1941, hours after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], Japanese forces from the Marianas launched an [[Battle of Guam (1941)|invasion of Guam]]. Chamorros from the Northern Marianas, which had been under Japanese rule for more than 20 years, were brought to Guam to assist the Japanese administration. This, combined with the harsh treatment of Guamanian Chamorros during the 31-month occupation, created a rift that would become the main reason Guamanians rejected [[1969 Guamanian unification with the Northern Mariana Islands referendum|the referendum]] on the reunification of Guam with the Northern Marianas that the Northern Marianas approved in the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}

On June 15, 1944, the United States military invaded the Mariana Islands, starting the [[Battle of Saipan]], which ended on July 9. Of the 30,000 Japanese troops defending Saipan, fewer than 1,000 remained alive at the battle's end.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/battle-of-saipan.htm |title=Battle Of Saipan |publisher=Historynet.com |access-date=August 29, 2015}}</ref> Many civilians were also killed, by disease, starvation, enemy fire, or suicide; about 1,000 civilians killed themselves by jumping off cliffs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Trefalt|first=Beatrice|date=November 2009|title=After the Battle for Saipan: the Internment of Japanese Civilians at Camp Susupe, 1944–1946|doi=10.1080/10371390903298037|journal=Japanese Studies|volume=29|issue=3|pages=337–352|s2cid=144676151|via=Taylor & Francis Online}}</ref> U.S. forces then recaptured Guam on July 21, and [[Battle of Tinian|invaded Tinian]] on July 24. A year later, [[Tinian]] was the takeoff point for the ''[[Enola Gay]]'', the plane that dropped the atomic bomb on [[Hiroshima]]. [[Rota (island)|Rota]] was left untouched (and isolated) until the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender in August 1945]], owing to its military insignificance and U.S. forces' strategy of "island hopping" in which they did not invade islands that they did not need. 

The war did not end for everyone with the signing of the armistice. A large group of [[Japanese holdout|Japanese holdouts]] surrendered on Saipan on December 1, 1945. However, a group of about 30 held out until 1951 on [[Anatahan]]; their story was told in the film ''[[Anatahan (film)|The Saga of Anatahan]]''. On a related note, on Guam, Japanese soldier [[Shoichi Yokoi]], unaware that the war had ended, hid in a jungle cave in the [[Talofofo, Guam|Talofofo]] area until 1972.

Japanese nationals were eventually repatriated to the [[Japanese archipelago|Japanese home islands]]. After World War II, the people of Marianas were able to return to the Northern Marianas under the protection of the United Nations Trusteeship administered by the United States. During this time, a series of referendums took place.

After Japan's defeat in World War II, the Northern Marianas were administered by the United States pursuant to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 21|Security Council Resolution 21]] as part of the United Nations [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]], which assigned responsibility for defense and foreign affairs to the United States as trustee.<ref name="Lin"/> Four referendums offering integration with Guam or changes to the islands' status were held in [[1958 Saipan integration referendum|1958]], [[1961 Northern Mariana Islands status referendum|1961]], [[1963 Northern Mariana Islands integration referendum|1963]] and [[1969 Northern Mariana Islands status referendum|1969]]. On each occasion, a majority voted in favor of integration with Guam, but this did not happen: Guam rejected integration in a [[1969 Guamanian Northern Mariana Islands union referendum|1969 referendum]].<ref name="micronesia">Bendure, G. & Friary, N.

The people of the Northern Mariana Islands decided in the 1970s not to seek independence, but instead to forge closer links with the United States. Negotiations for [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|commonwealth status]] began in 1972, and a covenant to establish a commonwealth in political union with the United States<ref>''The Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union With the United States of America'', {{USStatute|94|241|90|263|1976|03|24}}</ref> was approved in a [[1975 Northern Mariana Islands status referendum|1975 referendum]].<ref name="micronesia"/>{{rp|188}} A new government and constitution came into effect in part on January 9, 1978,<ref name="micronesia"/>{{rp|188}} after being approved in a [[1977 Northern Mariana Islands constitutional referendum|1977 referendum]].<ref name="CIA Factbook" /> The United Nations approved this arrangement pursuant to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 683|Security Council Resolution 683]].

In the 1960s and 1970s, agriculture and ranching became an important activity with thousands of beef cattle, dairy cows, hogs, and many crops such as pineapple. The food production became an important source of food supply for the Marianas region.<ref name=":0" />

In December 1986, 20 percent of the homes on Saipan were destroyed by [[Typhoon Kim (1986)|Typhoon Kim]], trees were stripped of foliage, thousands of coconut trees were knocked down, roads were blocked, and there was no electricity or public water supply for weeks.<ref name="micronesia"/>{{rp|186}}

In April 1990, the inhabitants of the western coast of [[Anatahan]] were evacuated after [[earthquake swarm]]s and active [[fumaroles]] indicated that an eruption might be imminent, but no eruption occurred at that time. A further earthquake swarm occurred in May 1992. The first historical eruption of Anatahan occurred in May 2003, when a large explosive eruption with a [[Volcanic Explosivity Index|VEI]] of 4 took place, forming a new crater inside the eastern [[caldera]] and causing an ash plume {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} high which impaired air traffic to Saipan and Guam.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=0804-20=&volpage=var |title=Anatahan: Index of Monthly Reports |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907042319/https://volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=0804-20=&volpage=var |archive-date=September 7, 2006|quote=''Local earthquakes and strong thermal activity; youngest surge deposits appear no more than a few hundred years old.''

The Northern Mariana Islands, together with [[Guam]] to the south, compose the [[Mariana Islands]] archipelago. The southern islands are [[limestone]], with level terraces and fringing [[coral]] reefs. The northern islands are volcanic, with active [[volcano]]es on several islands, including [[Anatahan]], [[Pagan Island|Pagan]], and [[Agrihan]]. The volcano on Agrihan, [[Mount Agrihan]], has the highest elevation at {{convert|3166|ft|m}}.<ref name="volcano.si.edu">{{cite web|url=http://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=284160|title=Global Volcanism Program {{!}} Agrigan|website=volcano.si.edu|language=en|access-date=February 3, 2017}}</ref> An expedition organized by John D.

The islands going from north to south comprise 14 main islands, but some smaller islands are often grouped together. Also, Zealandia Bank can sometimes be an island, depending on the tide. In terms of area, it is smaller than Guam; however, as an island chain, it spans hundreds of kilometers/miles from the northernmost to the southernmost. Many islands have multiple names due to popular nicknames, usually of Spanish, Chamorro, or English origin. Many of the islands have had to be evacuated due to volcanic activity.

The ocean area to the east of the islands and parts of the islands themselves are part of the [[Marianas Trench Marine National Monument]]. This area includes three northernmost islands, the "Arc of Fire" refuge, which includes 21 underwater volcanic sites, and the trench region, which goes to the maximum limit of the [[EEZ]]. The nature preserve aims to protect the unique marine life, which includes seabirds, sea turtles, unique coral reefs, and life around under-sea vents.

Guam is to the south of the CNMI and Rota. To the east is Wake Island, then further east is the island of Midway, and eventually, the start of the Hawaiian island chain. American Samoa is located to the east and south and lies below the Equator. To the north and east, lies Alaska, which is a string of islands known as the [[Aleutians]]. To the west of the CNMI is the Philippines, and to the south and west is Palua, home to [[Chamorro people|Chamorro]] people. To the south and east is Micronesia, which is home to the Carolinian people, many of which also settled on the CNMI centuries ago.

The Northern Mariana Islands have a [[multi-party system|multiparty]] [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] system. They are a commonwealth of the United States. Federal funds to the commonwealth are administered by the [[Office of Insular Affairs]] of the [[U.S. Department of the Interior]].

Replicating the separation of powers elsewhere in the United States, the [[executive power|executive branch]] is headed by the [[List of Northern Mariana Islands Governors|governor of the Northern Mariana Islands]]; [[legislative power]] is vested in the bicameral [[Northern Mariana Islands Commonwealth Legislature]] and the [[judiciary|judicial power]] is vested in the [[Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands|CNMI Supreme Court]] and the trial courts inferior to it.

Some critics, including the author of the political website ''[[Saipan Sucks]]'', say that politics in the Northern Mariana Islands is often "more a function of family relationships and personal loyalties" where the size of one's extended family is more important than a candidate's personal qualifications. They charge that this is [[nepotism]] carried out within the trappings of democracy.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Ellis |first=Jimmie L. |title=Total Resource Sharing among Collegiate and Public Libraries in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands: A Narrative Case Study |date=May 1, 2004 |degree=EdD |publisher=[[University of San Diego]] |url=https://digital.sandiego.edu/dissertations/729/ |doi=10.22371/05.2004.005 |doi-access=free |page=65}}</ref><ref name="Reyes">{{cite web |url=http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?newsID=1594&cat=3 |title=Primitive tribalism |author=Charles P.

[[File:Northern Mariana Islands regions map.png|thumb|Map showing the four municipalities of the Northern Mariana Islands, with Guam shown for context and indicating which islands have airports]]

Administratively, the CNMI is divided into four municipalities:

The Northern Islands (north of Saipan) form the [[Northern Islands Municipality]]. The three main islands of the Southern Islands form the municipalities of [[Saipan]], [[Tinian Municipality|Tinian]], and [[Rota (island)|Rota]], with uninhabited Aguijan forming part of Tinian municipality.

The northern islands have been evacuated because of a volcanic threat. Human habitation was limited to Agrihan, Pagan, and Alamagan, but the population varied due to various economic factors, including children's education. The 2020 census showed only seven residents in the Northern Islands Municipality, and the Northern Islands' mayor's office is located in "exile" on Saipan.

Saipan, Tinian, and Rota have the only ports and harbors and are the only permanently populated islands.

For statistical purposes, the [[United States Census Bureau]] counts the four municipalities of the Northern Mariana Islands as [[county equivalent]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/GARM/Ch4GARM.pdf |title=States, Counties, and Statistically Equivalent Entities (Chapter 4)|publisher=Census.gov|access-date=September 1, 2019}}</ref>

===Political status and autonomy===
{{further|Law of the Northern Mariana Islands}}
In 1947, the Northern Mariana Islands became part of the post–World War II United Nations [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] (TTPI). The United States became the TTPI's administering authority under the terms of a trusteeship agreement. In 1976, Congress approved the mutually negotiated Covenant to establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://cnmilaw.org/cov.php#gsc.tab=0| title = Covenant to establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America}}</ref> The Covenant was codified on March 24, 1976, as [[Public Law]] 94-241.<ref name=covenant>{{cite web|url=https://uscode.house.gov/statutes/pl/94/241.pdf|title=Public Law 94-241|date=March 24, 1976|publisher=uscode.house.gov}}</ref> The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) government adopted its own constitution in 1977, and the new government took office in January 1978. Implementation of the Covenant, which took effect on January 1, 1978, was completed on November 3, 1986, pursuant to Presidential Proclamation no. 5564; which placed into effect the Covenant With the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Compacts of Free Association With the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands.<ref>See
*{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/proclamations/05564.html|title=Proclamation 5564—Placing into full force and effect the Covenant With the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Compacts of Free Association With the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands|work=Codification of Presidential Proclamations and Executive Orders|publisher=[[Federal Register]]|date=November 3, 1986}}

The [[Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008]] ("CNRA"), approved by the [[U.S. Congress]] on May 8, 2008, established a [[United States congressional delegations from the Northern Mariana Islands|CNMI delegate]]'s seat; Democrat [[Gregorio Sablan]] was elected in [[2008 United States House of Representatives elections|November 2008]] as the first CNMI delegate and took office in the [[111th Congress]]. Like the other five delegates in the House, the CNMI delegate participates in debates and committee votes but has no vote on the floor of the House of Representatives and has no role in the U.S. Senate, but is equal to a Senator when serving on a conference committee.

On December 22, 1990, the [[United Nations Trusteeship Council]] terminated the TTPI as it applied to the CNMI and five other of the TTPI's original seven districts (the [[Marshall Islands]] and the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] (Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei and Yap)), this was acknowledged in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 683]] passed on the same day.

[[File:TTPI High Court judges.jpg|thumb|TTPI High Court judges (some time between 1968 and 1978)]]
Under the Covenant, only certain provisions of the U.S. Constitution apply to the Commonwealth, and legislation passed by the U.S. Congress can only apply to the Commonwealth if it applies to all 50 states.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cnmilaw.org/cov.php#gsc.tab=0|title=Covenant|website=Commonwealth Law Revision Commission}}</ref> The CNMI is outside the customs area of the United States and ''bona fide'' residents of the Commonwealth are exempt from U.S. federal income tax, as is the case in the four self-governing territories. According to the Covenant, the federal minimum wage and federal immigration laws "will not apply to the Northern Mariana Islands except in the manner and to the extent made applicable to them by the Congress by law after termination of the Trusteeship Agreement."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.doi.gov/oia/Islandpages/cnmipage.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614104551/http://www.doi.gov/oia/Islandpages/cnmipage.htm|title=Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands|website=US Department of the Interior|archive-date=June 14, 2006}}</ref> Local control of minimum wage was superseded by the United States Congress in 2007; it was slowly raised until in 2015 it reached parity with the 50 states.

Initially, under the Covenant, a separate immigration system existed in the CNMI, and U.S. immigration law did not apply. Still, the Covenant gave the United States power of reservation over immigration law in the Commonwealth. After reports surfaced of abusive practices for immigrant workers, on November 28, 2009, the United States exercised its power of reservation; specifically, CNRA § 702(a) amended the Covenant to state that "the provisions of the 'immigration laws' (as defined in section 101(a)(17) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(17))) shall apply to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands." Further, under CNRA § 702(a), the "immigration laws," as well as the amendments to the Covenant, "shall...supersede and replace all laws, provisions, or programs of the Commonwealth relating to the admission of aliens and the removal of aliens from the Commonwealth."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/eoir/vll/benchbook/tools/CNMI/CNMI%20Memo%20(3-29-10).pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926172413/http://www.justice.gov/eoir/vll/benchbook/tools/CNMI/CNMI%20Memo%20(3-29-10).pdf|title=Memorandum|date=March 29, 2010|publisher=US Department of Justice: Executive Office for Immigration Review|archive-date=September 26, 2011}}</ref> Transition to U.S. immigration laws began November 28, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digital.law.washington.edu/dspace-law/bitstream/handle/1773.1/488/20pacrimlpoly211.pdf |title=A Lesser-Known Immigration Crisis: Federal Immigration Law in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands |author=Robert J.

===Judicial system===
Cases under federal law are heard by the [[District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands]], which was established by [[act of Congress]] in 1977, and began operations in January 1978. The court sits on the island of [[Saipan]] but may sit in other places within the commonwealth. The district court has the same jurisdiction as all other United States district courts, including diversity jurisdiction and bankruptcy jurisdiction. Appeals are taken to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]]. As a [[United States territorial court]] established under Congress's territorial power granted by Article IV of the United States Constitution, judges do not have lifetime appointments, unlike the Article III courts in the 50 states, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.

Cases under territorial law are heard by the [[Superior Court of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands]], with appeals heard by the [[Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands]].

In June 2024, [[Julian Assange]] pleaded guilty in a court in Saipan, the capital of the US territory, before flying home to Australia.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn00720gx5jo | title=Why Northern Mariana Islands hosted Julian Assange hearing }}</ref>

===Citizenship===

[[File:Swimming Hole - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Rota's natural seawater swimming hole]]
The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands benefits from its trading relationship with the federal government of the United States and cheap trained labor from Asia. The CNMI's economy has historically relied on tourism, mostly from Japan, and the garment manufacturing sector. The economy has declined since quotas were lifted in 2005, eventually leading all the garment factories in Saipan to close by February 2009. Tourism also declined after 2005 when [[Japan Airlines]] stopped serving the Marianas.<ref name="Business Law Handbook">{{cite book |title=Northern Mariana Islands Business Law Handbook: Strategic Information and Laws |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wxatDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41 |date=January 1, 2012 |publisher=IBP USA |isbn=978-1-4387-7068-0 |pages=41–48}}</ref>

Agricultural production, primarily of [[tapioca]], cattle, [[coconut]]s, [[breadfruit]], tomatoes, and melons, is relatively unimportant in the economy, representing only 1.7% of CNMI GDP as of 2016.<ref name="CIA Factbook" /> It remains important for the community, and the Marianas, with their thousands of cattle and rich soils, are important for feeding the region, with Tinian being known as the breadbasket of the Marianas.<ref name=":0" /> The cattle herds in the CNMI supply beef not only locally but also to Guam, [[Palau]], and [[Micronesia]].<ref name=":0" /> Some of the cattle breeds on Tinian in the 21st century include [[Senepol]], [[Brangus]] (Brahman X Angus), [[Red Angus]], and [[American Brahman]], and various modern ranching techniques are utilized.<ref name=":0" />

Tourism was strong in 2019, comprising visitors mainly from China and South Korea. Tourism dropped during the pandemic, and has been slow to recover since it ended. Direct flights from Japan have decreased, and the political issues between the US and China have stopped all flights from China (except from Hong Kong) to Saipan.

===Labor controversies===
{{further|Saipan#Labor controversies}}
The Northern Mariana Islands had successfully used its position as a free trade area with the U.S., while at the same time not being subject to the same [[labor laws]]. For example, the Commonwealth's $3.05 per hour minimum wage, which lasted from 1997 to 2007, was lower than in the U.S., and some other worker protections are weaker, leading to lower production costs. That allowed garments to be labeled "Made in USA" without complying with all U.S. labor laws. However, the U.S. minimum wage law signed by [[Presidency of George W. Bush|President George W. Bush]] on May 25, 2007, resulted in stepped increases in the Northern Marianas' minimum wage, which allowed it to reach the U.S. level in 2015.<ref name="Vallejera">{{cite news |author=Jayvee L. Vallejera |title=NMI minimum wage hike OK'd |newspaper=Saipan Tribune |date=May 27, 2007 |url=http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?cat=1&newsID=68875 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003142/http://www.saipantribune.com/newsstory.aspx?cat=1&newsID=68875 |archive-date=September 27, 2007}}</ref> The first step (to $3.55) became effective July 25, 2007, and a yearly increase of $0.50 will take effect every May thereafter until the CNMI minimum wage equals the nationwide minimum wage. However, a law signed by [[Presidency of Barack Obama|President Obama]] in December 2009 delayed the yearly increase from May to September. In 2018, the minimum wage finally reached $7.25, matching the U.S. federal minimum wage.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Perez|first1=Jon|title=$7.25 per hour |url=https://www.saipantribune.com/index.php/7-25-per-hour/|newspaper=Saipan Tribune|access-date=July 22, 2020|date=October 1, 2018}}</ref>

An immigration system mostly outside of federal U.S. control (which ended on November 28, 2009) resulted in many Chinese migrant workers (about 15,000 during the peak years) being employed in the islands' garment trade. However, the lifting of [[World Trade Organization]] restrictions on Chinese imports to the U.S. in 2005 had put the commonwealth-based trade under severe pressure, leading to a number of factory closures. Along with the U.S.-imposed scheduled wage increases, the last factories were closed in early 2009 and the garment industry became extinct.<ref>{{cite news| author=Haidee V.

The official languages on the Northern Mariana Islands include [[English language|English]], [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]], and [[Carolinian language|Carolinian]]. Few people still speak the nearly extinct [[Tanapag language]]. Many [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]], Chinese, and other [[Languages of Oceania|Pacific island languages]] are also spoken. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is still retained in surnames but is no longer commonly used, though it is still familiar to some elders as a third or fourth language.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Solenberger |first=Robert R. |date=1962 |title=The Social Meaning of Language Choice in the Marianas |journal=Anthropological Linguistics |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=59–64 |jstor=30022346}}</ref>

===Religion===
[[File:Saipan Mount Carmel Cathedral.JPG|thumb|Our Lady of Mount Carmel Cathedral, Chalan Kanoa]]
Owing to the Spanish [[missionaries]] in the Marianas, a large majority of Chamorros and Carolinians practice [[Roman Catholicism]]. The Japanese occupation created a sizable [[Buddhist]] community which remained even after their departure. Due to the influence of the United States, diverse denominations of [[Protestantism]] also entered the islands. Many people on the Northern Mariana Islands are Roman Catholic or have traditional beliefs.

According to the [[Pew Research Center]], 2010:<ref>{{cite web |title=Religions in Northern Mariana Islands – PEW-GRF |url=http://www.globalreligiousfutures.org/countries/northern-mariana-islands#/?affiliations_religion_id=0&affiliations_year=2010 |url-status=dead |website=GlobalReligiousFutures.org |access-date=September 12, 2017 |archive-date=April 21, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421091227/http://www.globalreligiousfutures.org/countries/northern-mariana-islands#/?affiliations_religion_id=0&affiliations_year=2010 }}</ref>

===Education===
The [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Public School System]] operates public schools in the commonwealth and there are numerous private schools. [[Northern Marianas College]] is accredited by the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]] and offers a range of programs similar to other small U.S. [[community college]]s.

==Culture==
[[File:Women stick dancing in Tanapag Village, Saipan (2000).webm|thumb|Women performing a folk stick dance in Saipan, 2000]]
[[File:Chamorro performers.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|Chamorro people]]
Much of the Chamorro culture in the Mariana Islands was influenced by Spanish rule; it also displays influence from the Germans and Japanese. Respect is an integral part of Chamorro culture, and one typical display is the tradition of "manngingi'". This tradition has been around for centuries and involves an elder and a young Chamorro child. The child takes the hand of the elder, places it on their nose, and says ''ñot'' to the men and ''ñora'' to the women, with the elders responding ''diosti ayudi'' (from Spanish ''Señor'', ''Señora'', ''Dios Te Ayude''), meaning "God help you".

The [[Carolinian people|Carolinian]] culture is very similar to that of the Chamorros, with respect paramount. Carolinian culture can be traced to [[Yap]] and [[Chuuk Lagoon|Chuuk]], where the population originated. One of the differences between Guam and the Northern Marianas is the significant migration of the Carolinian (modern-day Micronesia) people and culture, in addition to the Chamorros.

===Cuisine===

[[File:Estufao.jpg|thumb|left|''Estufao'', a stewed meat dish similar to ''Kaddon pika'']]
{{main|Cuisine of the Mariana Islands}}
Much of Chamorro cuisine is influenced by various cultures. Popular foods of foreign origin include various types of sweet or savory [[empanada]], initially introduced by Spain, and [[pancit]], a noodle dish from the Philippines.

Archeological evidence reveals that rice has been cultivated in the Marianas since prehistoric times. Red rice made with [[Bixa orellana#Culinary uses|achoti]] is a distinct staple food that strongly distinguishes Chamorro cuisine from that of other Pacific islands. It is commonly served for special events, such as parties (gupot or "fiestas"), novenas, and high school or college graduations. Fruits such as [[breadfruit|lemmai]] (breadfruit), [[mango|mangga]] (mangoes), [[coconut|niyok]] (coconuts), and [[Averrhoa bilimbi|bilimbines]] (bilimbi, a fruit related to [[starfruit]]) are included in various local recipes. Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and American cuisine are also commonly available.

Local specialties include [[kelaguen]], a dish in which meat is cooked in whole or in part by the action of [[citric acid]] rather than heat; ''[[tinaktak]]'', a meat dish made with coconut milk; and kå'du fanihi (flying fox/fruit bat soup). Fruit bats have become scarce in modern times on several islands, primarily due to the overharvesting of the species and loss of habitat; hunting them is now illegal even though poaching still occurs.

The Marianas and the Hawaiian islands are the world's foremost consumers, per capita, of [[Spam (food)|Spam]], with Guam at the top of the list and Hawaii second (details regarding the rest of the Marianas are often absent from statistics). Spam was introduced to the islands by the American military as war rations during World War II.

Spam is considered a "default" meal or snack and is often incorporated into recipes such as Spam sushi, Spam pizza, Spam and eggs, and Spam-fried rice.<ref name="Arin Greenwood">{{Cite web |author=Arin Greenwood |title=Gadfly Online.

===Cinema===
{{Main|Cinema of Northern Mariana Islands}}
A small independent [[cinema of Northern Mariana Islands]], producing mostly documentary films, developed in the 21st century thanks to the efforts of the Commonwealth and of the [[Northern Marianas College]]. Foreign producers had already shot films on the islands in the 20th century.<ref name="Bill">{{cite act|type=Bill|date=2011|legislature=Seventeenth Northern Marianas Commonwealth Legislature|title=Commonwealth Film & Media Amendment Act of 2011|url=http://www.cnmileg.gov.mp/documents/house/hse_bills/17/HB17-157.pdf}}</ref>

In 2002, a new § 2151 of the Commonwealth Code established within the Marianas Visitors Authority (MVA), a Commonwealth Film, Video, and Media Office, also known as the Northern Mariana Islands Film Office, with the purpose of attracting foreign companies to produce movies in the Commonwealth and to develop a local cinema industry.<ref>{{cite act|type=Commonwealth Code|date=2002|article=2151|legislature=Northern Marianas Commonwealth Legislature|title=Commonwealth Film, Video and Media Office Established|url=https://www.cnmilaw.org/pdf/cmc_section/T4/2151.pdf}}</ref>

===Sports===
