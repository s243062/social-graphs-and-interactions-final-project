[[Snail]]s are eaten by humans in many areas such as Africa, [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Mediterranean basin|Mediterranean Europe]], while in other cultures, snails are seen as a [[taboo food]]. In English, edible land snails are commonly called '''escargot''', from the [[French language|French]] word for 'snail'.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Escargot |url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/escargot |access-date=2022-06-22 |website=[[Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary|Cambridge Dictionary]]}}</ref> Snails as a food date back to ancient times, with numerous cultures worldwide having traditions and practices that attest to their consumption. In the modern era<!-- Specify since when --> snails are farmed, an industry known as [[heliciculture]].

The snails are collected after the rains and are put to "purge" (fasting). In the past, the consumption of snails had a marked seasonality, from April to June.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Fundación Española de la Nutrición |date=2019 |title=Caracol de tierra |trans-title=Land snail |url=https://www.mapa.gob.es/es/ministerio/servicios/informacion/caracol%20tierra_tcm30-102855.pdf |journal=Crustáceos y Moluscos |language=es |publisher=[[Ministerio de Agricultura, Pesca y Alimentación]] |pages=527–528 |access-date=2022-02-04}}</ref> Now, snail-breeding techniques make them available all year.

== Etymology of ''escargot'' ==
''Escargot'', {{IPA|fr|ɛskaʁɡo|-|LL-Q150 (fra)-Penegal-escargot.wav}}, comes from the French term for snail. Usage of the French word "escargot" dates back to 1892. The French word, first recorded in the 14th century, derives from ''escaragol'' ([[Provençal dialect|Provençal]]) and then ''escargol'' ([[Old French]]). It ultimately traces back through [[Vulgar Latin]] ''coculium'' and Classical Latin ''conchylium'' to the Ancient Greek ''konchylion (κογχύλιον)'', which meant "edible shellfish, oyster". The ''Online Etymological Dictionary'' notes that the form of the word in Provençal and French seems to have been influenced by words related to the scarab. <ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Escargot |dictionary=[[Online Etymological Dictionary]] |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=escargot |access-date=April 9, 2016 |date=2016 |author=Harper, Douglas}}</ref>

== History ==
Researchers have not been able to pinpoint when humans began consuming snails, although archaeological discoveries point to earlier stages than the invention of [[hunting]]. A lot of broken snail shells have been found in the [[Franchthi Cave]], in the Greek [[Argolis]], from the year 10,700 BCE. In ''Historia de gastronomía'' (2004), [[Felipe Fernández-Armesto|Fernández-Armesto]] points out the possible reasons: snails are easy to handle, and their cultivation "seems like a natural extension of harvesting".{{sfn|Fernández-Armesto|2004|p=99}} 
<blockquote>
It is difficult to go beyond the limits of a developmentalist and progressive model of the history of food, according to which it is unthinkable that no food was cultivated in such early times, but snail farming is so simple, requires so little technical effort and is conceptually so close to harvesting methods, that it seems doctrinaire to the point of stubbornness to exclude such a possibility.
:– Felipe Fernandez-Armesto.{{sfn|Fernández-Armesto|2004|p=99}}
</blockquote>Many sites in the [[Zagros Mountains]] of Iraq and the [[Kermanshah province|Kermanshah]] region of western Iran are from the late Pleistocene and include snail shells that have been interpreted as food debris.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lubell|first=David|date=2004|title=Prehistoric edible land snails in the circum-Mediterranean: the archaeological evidence|url=http://watarts.uwaterloo.ca/~dlubell/Antibes.pdf|series=Petits animaux et sociétés humaines.

=== Ancient Rome ===
The Romans considered escargots an [[Delicacy|elite food]], as noted in the writings of [[Pliny the Elder]]. The Roman breeder [[Quintus Fulvius Lippinus]] is considered the "father" of heliciculture, or at least, the first written reference to snail farms. Lippinus established his study center in the Tuscan city of [[Tarquinia]] to feasibly domesticate various animals, such as dormouse and wild boar, among many others. However, he was best known for his enormous snails, of which he had several species brought from [[Illyria]] to [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]]. With a fatty diet he devised to fatten them, he obtained large quantities of snails, which he then marketed in Rome. His snails set the trend among the Roman upper class, and the practice became popular. Lippinus was an innovator who managed a large company that marketed his snails beyond the [[Mare Nostrum]].<ref group="n.">The story of Fulvius Lippinus is documented in the ''Rerum rusticarum'' libri III (chapters XII and XIV) by [[Marcus Terentius Varro]], and a century later in the ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'' (books VIII and IX) by Pliny the Elder.</ref> In ''[[De re coquinaria]]'', one of the complete Roman cookbooks, four recipes based on snails are mentioned.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Villegas Becerril |first=Almudena |url= |title=Gastronomía romana y dieta mediterránea: el recetario de Apicio |publisher=Palibrio |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-61764-138-1 |location=[[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]] |language=es |oclc=744601447}}</ref> Shells of the edible species ''[[Cernuella virgata]]'' and ''[[Otala lactea]]'' have been recovered from the Roman-era city [[Volubilis]], in present-day [[Morocco]].

Andy Burnham (2007) [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=14906 megalithic.co.uk]</ref>

=== Modern Age ===
[[Pope Pius V]], who was an avid eater of snails, decided that they had to be considered as fish to continue eating them during [[Lent]], exclaiming: ''Estote pisces in aeternum!'' ("you will be fish forever!").<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Cattaneo-Vietti |first1=Riccardo |url= |title=Man and Shell Molluscs in the History |last2=Doneddu |first2=Mauro |last3=Trainito |first3=Egidio |date=2016-02-04 |publisher=Bentham Science Publishers |isbn=978-1-68108-225-7 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=PMnnDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA48 48] |language=}}</ref> In Spain, the custom continued to have continuity as can be seen in the gastronomic literature of that time. In the ''{{Ill|Libro del arte de cozina|lt=|es}}'' by Diego Granado, head chef of the Spanish royal household, a section was dedicated to the snail, explaining its biological characteristics, how to clean it, and various recipes on how to cook it, fry it, etc. This book was published in 1614 in [[Lleida]], a city in western [[Catalonia]] famous for its culinary tradition of the snail.{{sfn|Morell i Bitrià|1999|p=5}}

In the stricter [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] tradition of fasting, snails are still considered fully Lenten, being [[invertebrate]]s, and are historically and presently popular.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Oberhelman |first=Steven M. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PYpnEAAAQBAJ&dq=Snails+orthodox+Lent&pg=PA345 |title=Healing Manuals from Ottoman and Modern Greece: The Medical Recipes of Gymnasios Lauriōtis in Context |date=2020-07-06 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG |isbn=978-3-11-066443-0 |language=en}}</ref>

''USDA''. And as a reference for this article, the Spanish Ministry of Food data is taken, see {{Harvtxt|Fundación Española de la Nutrición|2019}}.</ref> Even so, it can be said that snails are rich in inorganic nutrients: 82% water, minerals such as [[magnesium]] and [[iron]] (mainly, but also calcium, phosphorus, potassium, and sodium), in addition to a high percentage of niacin ([[vitamin B3]]), since for every 100 g of snail meat, up to 55% of the [[Dietary Reference Intake|DRI]] (in women) and 41% DRI (in men).<ref name=":0" /> Snails are a good source of [[selenium]]. Of the recommended daily requirement of selenium, the snail provides up to 50% (in women) and 30% (in men).<ref name=":1" />

Snail flesh is a good supply of essential amino acids such as lysine, methionine, and cysteine, which are difficult to get in other sources of protein, according to Adeyeye et al. (2020). Scientists also point out that a variety of vitamins, including vitamins A, E, and B12, are present in snail meat and are crucial for maintaining general health and wellbeing.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Adeyeye |first1=Samuel Ayofemi Olalekan |last2=Bolaji |first2=Olusola Timothy |last3=Abegunde |first3=Titilope Adebusola |last4=Adesina |first4=Taofeek Olawale |date=2020-01-01 |title=Processing and utilization of snail meat in alleviating protein malnutrition in Africa: a review |url=https://doi.org/10.1108/NFS-08-2019-0261 |journal=Nutrition & Food Science |volume=50 |issue=6 |pages=1085–1097 |doi=10.1108/NFS-08-2019-0261 |s2cid=213550199 |issn=0034-6659|url-access=subscription }}</ref>

== Culinary use ==
=== Cleaning ===
Before use in the kitchen, snails must be cleaned to remove impurities.<ref name=":0" /> The cleaning process (called ''purgado'' in Spanish) consists of leaving them alive for several days without eating, or only eating flour. The flour method is a homemade resource to clean the animal's digestive tract.{{sfn|Sánchez|2017}} Formerly in Spain, snails were hung from [[String bag|mesh bags]] from which they could not escape. Snail chef {{Harvard citation text|Morell i Bitrià|1999}} recommends not giving them anything to eat for at least eight days (ideally ten or twelve) and then washing them well. Snails that die during the purging process should be disposed of.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cano |first=Julio César |url= |title=La cocina charnega |publisher=Grup 62 |year=2004 |isbn=84-8307-619-5 |edition=1 |location=[[Barcelona]] |pages=60 |language=es |chapter=Los caracoles. Ingredientes para hacer una buena caracolada |oclc=55844574}}</ref>

=== Preparation ===
[[Snail slime]] should be removed with as many washes of water as possible, in a colander under running water or in a saucepan. Again they are washed, this time with salt water, which helps cut through the slime.{{sfn|Sánchez|2017}} After being cleaned and washed several times, they are transferred to a pot with cold water and salt, when they emerge from their shells the heat is raised to the maximum, and they are cooked for approximately a quarter of an hour. After this, they are served in the chosen stew, sauce, or other recipe. This intermediate action is popularly known as "cheating" (''engañar'') the snail in Spain, as they come out of their shells once the water heats up, and when they're outside the flame is increased further to rapidly heat the water and kill the snails.{{sfn|Cano|2004|p=61}}

=== Consumption ===
[[File:Escargots 3.jpg|200px|thumb|In ''[[haute cuisine]]'', it is customary to serve snails with pince à escargot and ''fourchette à escargot''.]]

On a culinary level, they can be cooked in many ways: stews, baked, ''a la gormanta'', ''a la brutesque''. In the cuisine of [[Lleida]], they are an ingredient in many traditional dishes, in many cases mixed with other meats such as pig's feet, rabbit, chicken, lobsters and prawns, etc.{{sfn|Morell i Bitrià|1999|p=12}}

== By region ==
=== African Guinea ===
[[File:Nigeria snails2.jpg|200px|thumb|Seller of snails in [[Nigeria]]]]
People in [[Cameroon]], [[Ghana]], [[Nigeria]], and other countries in the area are used to eating African varieties of snail, which are larger. Typical of [[Equatorial Guinea]] is a giant sea snail called ''bilolá'' (''[[Persististrombus latus]]''), eaten stewed or sautéed, which in [[Cape Verde]] is known as ''búzio cabra'', and is grilled on skewers. It is also known as Igbin amongst the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] of western Nigeria.

=== Mediterranean Basin ===
[[File:Snails for sale in a French market - live snails.jpg|thumb|Live snails for sale in a market in France]]
There is a tradition of consuming snails in Andorra, Spain, France, Italy, and Portugal on the European side and Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia on the African side. ''[[Cornu aspersum]]'' is the most widespread species in the Mediterranean basin, the Iberian Peninsula, and the French Atlantic coast.

In [[French cuisine]], snails are typically purged, killed, shelled, and cooked (usually with [[garlic butter]], [[Stock (food)|chicken stock]] or [[wine]]), and then placed back into the shells with the butter sauce and additional ingredients, such as garlic, thyme, parsley, or pine nuts. Special tongs for holding the shell and forks for extracting the meat are typically provided. Escargot is served on indented metal trays with places for six or 12 snails.

In [[Cretan cuisine]], the snails are first boiled in white wine with bay leaves, celery, and onion and then coated with flour and fried with rosemary and vinegar.

In [[Maltese cuisine]], snails ([[Maltese language|Maltese]]: ''bebbux'') of the ''[[Helix aspersa|petit gris]]'' variety are [[Simmering|simmered]] in red wine or ale with [[Mentha|mint]], [[basil]] and [[marjoram]]. The snails are cooked and served in their shells.

In [[Lebanon]], land snails are collected from the mountains and then served alongside a [[tahini]]-based sauce called [[tarator (sauce)|tarator]] in a dish called ''bzeh ma' tarator'' ({{langx|apc|بزاق مع طراطور}}).<ref name="MEMO">{{cite news |title=Snails and tahini: Lebanon's best kept culinary secret |url=https://www.middleeasteye.net/features/snails-and-tahini-lebanons-best-kept-culinary-secret |access-date=12 August 2025 |work=Middle East Eye |date=6 Apr 2018 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="lorient">{{cite news |title=In rural Lebanon, autumn’s first rains summon an annual delicacy |url=https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1316053/in-rural-lebanon-autumns-first-rains-summon-an-annual-delicacy.html |access-date=12 August 2025 |work=L'Orient Today |date=28 October 2022 |language=en}}</ref>

In [[Moroccan cuisine]], snails, also called ''ghlal'', are a popular street food. They are cooked in a jar filled with hot water, special spices, and herbs. After cooking, Moroccan snails are served in small bowls with broth and consumed hot.
