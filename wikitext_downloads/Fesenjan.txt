'''Fesenjān''' ({{langx|fa|فسنجان}}; also called '''Fesenjoon''' in [[Tehrani accent|Tehrani dialect]]) is a sweet and sour [[Iranian cuisine|Iranian]] [[stew]] (a [[khoresh]]). The roots of this Persian delicacy trace back to the [[Sassanid Persia]]'s golden age.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-01-14 |title=Fesenjoon is one of the best Persian food |url=https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/444141/Fesenjoon-is-one-of-the-best-Persian-food |access-date=2024-06-11 |website=Tehran Times |language=en}}</ref> It is typically served over rice in the Iranian manner.<ref>{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=E.N. |title=Asian Cuisines: Food Culture from East Asia to Turkey and Afghanistan |date=30 April 2018 |publisher=Berkshire Publishing Group |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A5C8DwAAQBAJ |page=99|isbn=9781614728467 }}</ref> In Iran, it is made with minced meat (lamb, sheep or beef), meatballs, chicken or duck. Like other ''khoresh'' stews served over rice, ''fesenjan'' is common also to [[Iraqi cuisine]] through Iranian pilgrims visiting [[Shia]] sites such as [[Imam Husayn shrine]].<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Amanat |editor-first1=Abbas |editor-last2=Vejdan |editor-first2=Farzin |title=Iran Facing Others: Identity Boundaries in a Historical Perspective| date=2012 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan}}</ref> As a festive dish for special occasions, it has become part of Jewish [[Rosh Hashannah]] celebrations, even though the typology of [[Jewish cuisine|Jewish ethnic cuisines]] is imprecise.<ref>''The Oxford Handbook of the Jewish Diaspora'', Oxford University Press, 2021, p. 683</ref> In [[Azerbaijan]], where it is called ''fisincan plov'', the stew is made with lamb meatballs instead of poultry.<ref>{{cite AV media |title=Fisincan Plov Nasıl Yapılır? - Can Azerbaycan - TRT Avaz |language=Azerbaijani |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GK3iK9Okh-A}}</ref>

== About ==
Fesenjān is flavored with [[Pomegranate molasses|pomegranate paste]] and ground [[walnut]]s (see ''[[Walnut sauce#Bazhe|bazha]]'')<ref name="Miers">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/15/roast-winter-vegetables-walnut-pomegranate-sauce-recipe-fesenjan-thomasina-miers|title=Thomasina Miers' recipe for roast winter vegetables with walnut and pomegranate sauce|last=Miers|first=Thomasina|date=2017-12-15|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-07-26|quote=Richly sweet, subtly sour, with a satisfying depth of flavour from ground walnuts: fesenjan is a tempting Persian stew traditionally eaten during the winter solstice.}}</ref> and spices like turmeric, cinnamon, orange peel, cardamom, and rosebud.<ref name="Davidson">{{cite book |last1=Davidson |first1=Alan|editor-last1=Jaine|editor-first1=Tom|authorlink=Alan Davidson (food writer)|editor-link1=Tom Jaine|title=The Oxford Companion to Food |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0199677337 |edition=3|page=48}}</ref> It is traditionally made with eggplant and [[poultry]] ([[duck]] or [[Chicken (food)|chicken]]).<ref name="Davidson" /> Fesenjān can also be made using balls of [[ground meat]] or chunks of lamb. Depending on the recipe, it can have a sweet or sour taste. Fesenjān is served with Iranian white or yellow [[rice]] (''[[Polow|polo]]'' or ''chelo''). 

If the pomegranate sauce comes out too sour, sugar and fried onions may be added to sweeten it.<ref name="Iranica">{{cite web |last1=Elahi |first1=Etrat |title=FESANJĀN |url=https://iranicaonline.org/articles/fesanjan- |website=Encyclopaedia Iranica |access-date=6 March 2022}}</ref> Sometimes, a hot iron is applied to cause [[oxidation]] and darken the sauce's color.<ref name="Iranica"/>

It is a dish that is part of the dinner table on [[Yaldā Night]] celebrations.<ref name="Miers" /> 

== History ==
The earliest known reference to fesenjān is in ''Mirza Ali-Akbar Khan Ashpazbashi''{{'}}s ''Sofra-ye at'ema'' from 1881, which lists ten different varieties of the dish: walnut (today the most common), almond, eggplant, [[kidney bean]], [[quince]], potato, carrot, pumpkin, fish, and yogurt.<ref name="Iranica"/> The first dictionary to mention fesenjān is the ''Farhang-e Anandraj'', which calls it ''fasūjan''.<ref name="Iranica"/>

== Culture ==
Fesenjān is an elaborate dish that is often reserved for special occasions.<ref name="Iranica"/> It is considered "a rich man's dish", which is referenced in the Persian expression "he behaves as if he has had partridge and fesenjān", meaning to show off or act pretentiously.<ref name="Iranica"/>

In the traditional Iranian system of garm and sard foods (i.e. "hot" and "cold", respectively), fesenjān is considered "hot" because it uses walnuts, which are also considered a "hot" food.<ref name="Iranica"/> In order to balance out this hotness, sometimes people will add [[coriander]] (a "cold" plant) to it; peeled pumpkin is also added for the same reason, as well as to act as a sugar substitute.<ref name="Iranica"/>
