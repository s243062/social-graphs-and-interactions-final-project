The pastry is made of a thin flaky [[dough]] such as [[filo]] with a variety of fillings, such as meat, cheese, spinach, or potatoes. A borek may be prepared in a large pan and cut into portions after baking, or as individual pastries. They are usually baked but some varieties can be fried. Borek is sometimes sprinkled with [[sesame]] or [[nigella seed]]s, and it can be served hot or cold.

Throughout the Balkan peninsula and in [[West Asia]], it is commonly served with [[ayran]], or [[yogurt]]. It is a custom of [[Sephardic Jews]] to have ''[[bourekas]]'' for their [[Shabbat]] breakfast meal on Saturday mornings.

==Origin and names==
The English name ''borek''<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> comes from [[Turkish language|Turkish]] {{lang|tr|börek}} (<small>Turkish pronunciation:</small> [[Help:IPA/Turkish|[bœˈɾec]]], [[Ottoman Turkish|Ottoman]] {{Lang|ota|بورك}}), while ''burek'' is used in the countries of the [[Yugoslavia#New states|former Yugoslavia]]. Forms in other languages include: {{langx|sq|byrek}}; {{langx|el|μπουρέκι|bouréki}}; {{Langx|hy|բյորեկ|byorek}}; {{langx|arq|بُريك|bourek}} and {{lang|arq-Latn|brick annabi}}; and {{langx|aeb-Latn|[[brik]]}}.{{Cn|date=March 2025}}

According to [[lexicographer]] [[Sevan Nişanyan]], the Turkish word {{Lang|tr|börek}} is ultimately originated from [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] {{Lang|tr|bögrek}}, from ''[[:wikt:böğür|böğür]]'' (meaning 'kidney').<ref name=nisanyan>{{cite web |last1=Nişanyan |first1=Sevan |title=börek - Nişanyan Sözlük |url=https://www.nisanyansozluk.com/kelime/b%C3%B6rek |website=Nişanyan Sözlük |access-date=15 April 2023 |archive-date=23 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230823052229/https://www.nisanyansozluk.com/kelime/b%C3%B6rek |url-status=live }}</ref> Nişanyan noted that the word is also used in [[Siberian Turkic languages]] such as [[Yakut language|Saqa]] as ''börüök''.<ref name="nisanyan" /> According to another theory, it may have come from the [[Persian language|Persian]] {{Transliteration|fa|burak}} ({{Lang|fa|بورک}}), the diminutive form of {{Transliteration|fa|būra}} or {{Transliteration|fa|buġra}} or ({{Lang|fa|بوره/بغره}}), meaning "stew", and refers to any dish made with ''[[filo|yufka]]'' (filo).{{Citation needed|date=April 2023}} The Persian word {{Transliteration|fa|bureh}} goes back to the [[Middle Persian]] *bōrak. This word ultimately goes back to the [[Proto-Indo-European]] root [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/bʰer-|*bher-]] which meant "to carve, cut, split".<ref name=":2">Hạsandūst, Muhạmmad. 2014.Hassandust, Mohammad. 2015.

One theory posits that the dish in general is a descendant of the pre-existing [[Byzantine cuisine|Eastern Roman (Byzantine)]] dish ''en tyritas plakountas'' ([[Byzantine Greek]]: {{Lang|grc|εν τυρίτας πλακούντας}}) "cheesy placenta", itself a descendant of ''[[placenta (food)|placenta]]'', the classical baked layered dough and cheese dish of [[Ancient Greek cuisine|Ancient Greek]], [[Ancient Roman cuisine|Ancient Roman]] and [[Byzantine cuisine]].<ref name="books.google.com" /><ref name="faas" /><ref name="Speros Vryonis 1971, p. 482" /><ref name=":3">{{Cite book |last1=Moudiotis |first1=George |title=Traditional Greek Cooking: A Memoir with Recipes |date=1998 |publisher=Garnet |isbn=9781859641170}}</ref>

Some types of borek could possibly have been prepared in [[Turkish cuisine]], according to this theory, they have been developed in [[Central Asia]] before some westward migration to [[Anatolia]] in the late Middle Ages,<ref name="AHBADADDED" /><ref name="Perry, Charles 1994" /> or by nomadic Turks of Central Asia some time before the seventh century.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.historytoday.com/archive/historians-cookbook/history-borek|title=A History of Börek|last=Lee|first=Alexander|date=9 September 2019|website=History Today|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190917104220/https://www.historytoday.com/archive/historians-cookbook/history-borek|archive-date=17 September 2019|access-date=17 September 2019}}</ref>

It can also be made as one large byrek that is cut into smaller pieces. There are different regional variations of byrek. It can be served cold or hot.

The most common fillings include: cheese (especially ''gjizë'', salted [[curd]] cheese), ground meat and onions ([[ragù]]-style filling), [[spinach]] and eggs, milk and eggs with pre-baked dough layers, it can also be made with tomato and onions, peppers and beans, potato or a sweet filling of [[pumpkin]], [[Stinging nettle|nettles]] (known as ''byrek me hithra''), or kidney beans (''byrek me fasule'') which is popular in winter.<ref name="drivemefoody">{{cite web |date=21 June 2020 |title=An introduction to Albanian food in 10 dishes |url=https://drivemefoody.com/en/albanian-food-10-dishes/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211130183309/https://drivemefoody.com/en/albanian-food-10-dishes/ |archive-date=2021-11-30 |access-date=2020-07-14 |website=drivemefoody.com}}</ref>

[[Bougatsa]] ({{Langx|el|μπουγάτσα}}) is a Greek variation of a burek which consists of either semolina custard, cheese, or minced meat filling between layers of phyllo, and is said to originate in the city of [[Serres]]. Nowadays, it is most popular in [[Thessaloniki]], a city that lies in the [[Central Macedonia]] region of [[Northern Greece]].<ref name=":4" /> Serres achieved the record for the largest puff pastry on 1 June 2008. It weighed 182.2 kg (402 lb), was 20 metres (66 ft) long, and was made by more than 40 bakers.<ref name=":5" />

[[Tiropita]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]: τυρóπιτα, "cheese-pie") is a Greek pastry made with layers of buttered filo dough and filled with a [[cheese]]-[[egg]] mixture. It is served either in an individual-size free-form wrapped shape, or as a larger pie that is portioned.<ref name=":8" /> When made with [[kasseri]] cheese, it may be called ''kasseropita'' ({{lang|grc|κασερόπιτα}}).<ref name=":9" />

[[Spanakopita]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]: σπανακόπιτα, from σπανάκι ''spanáki''<nowiki/>'spinach', and πίτα ''píta'' 'pie') is a [[Greece|Greek]] savory spinach [[pie]] that often also contains cheese, typically [[feta]]. In such a case it may be called ''spanakotiropita'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: σπανακοτυρόπιτα "spinach-cheese pie"). In [[southern Greece]], the term spanakopita is also common for the versions with cheese. A version without [[cheese]] and [[Egg as food|eggs]] is eaten during [[Fasting#Eastern Orthodoxy|religious fasts]] throughout Greece. Spanakopita appears in many traditional [[Greek cuisine|Greek]] [[Cookbook|cookbooks]] and appears in numerous restaurants and hotel menus throughout [[Greece]] and internationally.<ref name=":11" /><ref name="cloake">{{cite news |last=Cloake |first=Felicity |author-link=Felicity Cloake |date=22 August 2018 |title=How to make the perfect spanakopita |url=https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/aug/22/how-to-cook-the-perfect-spanakopita-greek-spinach-feta-pie |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201109024706/https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/aug/22/how-to-cook-the-perfect-spanakopita-greek-spinach-feta-pie |archive-date=9 November 2020 |access-date=18 September 2020 |work=The Guardian}}</ref>

=== Moldova and Romania ===
The regional cuisine of the [[Moldova|Moldavian]] West bank of the [[Pruth]] still yields a type of dumpling-like food called ''burechiuşe'' (sometimes called ''burechiţe'') which is described as dough in the shape of a ravioli-like square which is filled with mushrooms such as [[Boletus edulis]], and sealed around its edges and then tossed and subsequently boiled in [[borscht]] like soups<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gazetadeagricultura.info/dezvoltare-rurala/obiceiuri-si-traditii/12298-credinte-si-traditii-de-ajun-si-craciun.html |title=Credinte si traditii de Ajun si Craciun |access-date=2022-09-28 |archive-date=2022-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220928125636/https://www.gazetadeagricultura.info/dezvoltare-rurala/obiceiuri-si-traditii/12298-credinte-si-traditii-de-ajun-si-craciun.html |url-status=live }}</ref> or [[chorba]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_vQuvjcXAgIg/TFrHKMvx6bI/AAAAAAAAAqI/H1WJHV6EyMk/s1600/Retete+traditionale+0004.JPG|title=Photo of a plate with "ciorba de burchite"|access-date=2012-03-05|archive-date=2014-03-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327073604/http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_vQuvjcXAgIg/TFrHKMvx6bI/AAAAAAAAAqI/H1WJHV6EyMk/s1600/Retete+traditionale+0004.JPG|url-status=live}}</ref>{{bcn|date=July 2024}} They are traditionally eaten in the last day of fasting at the time of the [[Christmas Eve]]. It is not clear if the ''burechiuşe'' derive their name from the Turco-Greek ''börek'' (which is a distinct possibility given the fact that Moldavia was ruled for many decades by dynasties of Greek [[Phanariote]]s and that encouraged Greek colonists to settle in the area), so at the receiving end of cultural and culinary influences coming from them, or it takes its name from that of the mushroom [[Boletus]] (''burete'' in its Romanian language rhotacised version, and it meant "mushroom" as well as "sponge") by the pattern of the [[ravioli]], which were named after the Italian name of the [[turnip]] with which they were once filled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etimo.it/?cmd=id&id=2403&md=5938c3ae8e79e3cdb880a55a0cd8edc7|title=Etimologia : boleto;|website=etimo.it|access-date=2012-03-05|archive-date=2012-05-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522214401/http://etimo.it/?cmd=id&id=2403&md=5938c3ae8e79e3cdb880a55a0cd8edc7|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Former Yugoslavia===
[[File:Burek trokut 3.png|thumb|Round burek filled with minced meat as made in former Yugoslav countries]]
In the [[former Yugoslavia]], '''burek''', also known as ''pita'' in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], is an extremely common dish, made with yufka.<ref name="Parker Bowles 2012 224">{{cite book|last=Parker Bowles|first=Tom|title=The World's Best Street Food|year=2012|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74220-593-9|pages=224|url=http://shop.lonelyplanet.com/world/worlds-best-street-food|access-date=2012-03-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229012148/http://shop.lonelyplanet.com/world/worlds-best-street-food|archive-date=2012-02-29|url-status=dead}}</ref> This kind of pastry is also popular in [[Croatia]], where it was imported by [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Albanians]]. In Serbia, Albania, Kosovo, Croatia, Montenegro and North Macedonia, ''burek'' is made from layers of dough, alternating with layers of other fillings in a circular baking pan and then topped with a last layer of dough. Traditionally, it may be baked with no filling (''prazan'', meaning empty), with stewed minced meat and onions, or with cheese. Modern bakeries offer cheese and spinach, meat, apple, sour cherries, potato, mushroom, and other fillings. It is often eaten along with a plain yoghurt drink.

[[Ispanaklı Selanik Böreği|Zeljanica]] is a spinach or chard based burek common throughout the Balkans.

The same spiral filled with cottage cheese is called ''sirnica'', with spinach and cheese ''zeljanica'', with potatoes ''krompiruša'', and all of them are generically referred to as ''pita''. [[Egg (food)|Eggs]] are used as a binding agent when making ''sirnica'' and ''zeljanica''.

==== Serbia ====

The recipe for "round" burek was developed in the Serbian town of [[Niš]]. In 1498, it was introduced by a famous Turkish baker, Mehmed Oğlu, from Istanbul.<ref>{{cite news |first = M. |last = Doderović |title = Draži burek nego "Mek" |url = http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2004/07/08/srpski/N04070701.shtml |work = [[Glas Javnosti]] |publisher = Glas Javnosti |date = 2004-07-08 |access-date = 2006-09-06 |language = sr |archive-date = 2012-03-03 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120303094205/http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2004/07/08/srpski/N04070701.shtml |url-status = live}}</ref> Eventually burek spread from the southeast (southern Serbia, Kosovo and North Macedonia) to the rest of Yugoslavia. Niš hosts an annual burek competition and festival called ''Buregdžijada''.

==== Slovenia ====
In Slovenia, burek is a recognizable and widely available fast food, particularly among students and in urban nightlife settings. While it enjoys popularity in certain contexts, it also carries complex cultural associations linked to its Balkan origins, and is not universally embraced as part of mainstream Slovenian cuisine.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://dk.fdv.uni-lj.si/diplomska/pdfs/rudovic-zvanut-bojana.pdf |title=Pomeni bureka v Sloveniji: diplomska naloga |trans-title=The Meanings of Burek in Slovenia: Diploma Thesis |language=sl, en |first=Bojana |last=Rudovič Žvanut |year=2010 |publisher=Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Ljubljana |access-date=2011-01-31 |archive-date=2011-01-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124151110/http://dk.fdv.uni-lj.si/diplomska/pdfs/rudovic-zvanut-bojana.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== Israel ====
{{Main|Bourekas}}
[[File:Potato bourekas.jpg|thumb|Fresh potato burekas on sale at a stall in [[Mahane Yehuda Market]], Jerusalem]]
Burekas ({{langx|he|בורקס}}) have long been part of [[Sephardic cuisine|Sephardic Jewish cuisine]], ever since the migration of a large portion of that community to the [[Ottoman Empire]] following the [[Expulsion of Jews from Spain]]. The name "burekas" is the plural form of the original Balkan dish, as conjugated in [[Judaeo-Spanish]]. The name refers both to larger varieties (palm-sized or larger) and smaller varieties (originally called "Burekitas" by contrast, though the word has fallen out of use in [[Modern Hebrew]]). Burekas were later introduced to Israel by Sephardi immigrants from communities in Turkey and the Balkans during Ottoman rule. They are now sold commonly in bakeries, as well as dedicated market stalls, throughout the country.

Israeli Burkeas may be prepared with a variety of different fillings; although meat is less-commonly used because of [[Kashrut#Separation of meat and milk|Jewish dietary laws]] – specifically the prohibition against mixing milk and meat. Many types of burekas prepared and sold in Israel (particularly those that do not contain cheese) are made with [[Margarine]]-based doughs rather than butter-based doughs, in order to make them [[Parve]] – allowing them to be eaten as part of any type of meal. The most popular fillings are salty cheese (primarily [[Feta]]), spinach, eggplant and mashed potato. Other fillings include mushrooms, [[sweet potato]], chickpeas, olives, [[Malva|mallow]]s, [[swiss chard]], and tomato sauce (known as "burekas pizza"). Burekas are traditionally offered as snacks during large gatherings and even office meetings. Multiple locally made brands and varieties of pre-made, frozen burekas (for quick baking or frying) are commonly sold in grocery stores. 

Other related pastries traditionally consumed by Sephardic Jews include [[bulemas]] and [[boyoz]], which are also popular in the Turkish city of [[İzmir|Izmir]].<ref>İpkoparan, B., & Özkanli, O.

In Tunisia, there is a variant known as the brik ({{IPAc-en|b|r|iː|k}} {{respell|BREEK}}; {{lang|ar|بريك}}) that consists of thin crepe-like pastry around a filling and is commonly [[deep fried]]. The best-known is the egg brik, a whole egg in a triangular pastry pocket with chopped onion, tuna, [[harissa]] and parsley.<ref>Michael and Frances Field, ''A Quintet of Cuisines'', Time-Life, 1970. {{ISBN|0-8094-0075-8}}</ref> The Tunisian ''brik'' is also very popular in Israel, due to the large [[Tunisian Jewish]] population there. It is often filled with a raw egg and herbs or tuna, harissa, and olives, and it is sometimes served in a [[pita]].
