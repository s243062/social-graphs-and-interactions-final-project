==Name==
The name comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|γύρος}} ({{Transliteration|el|gýros}}, {{gloss|circle}} or {{gloss|turn}}). It is a [[calque]] of the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] {{Transliteration|tr|döner}}, from {{Transliteration|tr|dönmek}}, also meaning {{gloss|turn}}.<ref>Babiniotis, {{lang|el|Λεξικό της Ελληνικής Γλώσσας}}</ref>

In Greek, "{{Transliteration|el|gyros|italic=no}}" is a [[Nominative case|nominative]] singular noun, but the final 's' is often interpreted in English usage as plural,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/gyro|title=Gyro |website=dictionary.cambridge.org|language=en|access-date=2019-07-14|archive-date=2019-07-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190714082641/https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/gyro|url-status=live}}</ref> leading to the singular [[back-formation]] "gyro".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.houstonpress.com/restaurants/greek-101-6435779|title=Greek 101|first=Jay|last=Francis|date=2009-01-09|website=Houston Press|access-date=2019-10-28|archive-date=2021-06-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210608105153/https://www.houstonpress.com/restaurants/greek-101-6435779|url-status=live}}</ref> The standard Greek and English pronunciation is {{IPA|el|ˈʝiɾos|}}. Some English speakers pronounce it {{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|aɪ|r|oʊ}}, because the word is a [[Heteronym (linguistics)|heteronym]] of the related word "[[wikt:gyro|gyro]]".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cutolo |first=Morgan |date=24 July 2024 |title=Gyro Food Pronunciation: What Is the Correct Way? |url=https://www.rd.com/article/how-to-pronounce-gyro/ |access-date=16 October 2024 |website=rd.com}}</ref>

In Athens and other parts of southern Greece, the skewered meat dish elsewhere called [[souvlaki|{{Transliteration|el|souvlaki}}]] is known as {{Transliteration|el|kalamaki}}, while {{Transliteration|el|souvlaki}} is a term used generally for gyros, and similar dishes.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Joyce-Ann|last1=Gatsoulis|title=Night+Day Athens|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vdp1BOQIR40C&pg=PA43|publisher=ASDavis Media Group|date=2006|isbn=9780976601302|via=Google Books|access-date=2019-10-28|archive-date=2023-03-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230307201324/https://books.google.com/books?id=vdp1BOQIR40C&pg=PA43|url-status=live}}</ref> In other regions, for example in [[Thessaloniki]], {{Transliteration|el|gyros}} only refers to the meat on the spit, and what English speakers refer to as a "gyros wrap" is called a {{gloss|sandwich}} ({{lang|el|σάντουιτς}}).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Θεσσαλονίκη VS Αθήνα.

There are several claimants to have introduced the first mass-produced gyros to the United States, all based in the Chicago area in the early 1970s, and of Greek descent. One of them, Peter Parthenis, has said that the mass-produced gyro was first conceptualized by John and Margaret Garlic; John Garlic was a Jewish car salesman who later ran a restaurant featuring live dolphins.<ref name="The New York Times"/>

The Halifax donair in Canada which was based on the Greek gyros was invented in the 1970s by Peter Gamoulakos. Originally from Greece, he started selling Greek gyros (a pita stuffed with grilled lamb and tzatziki) from his restaurant located off the Bedford Highway.<ref>{{Cite web |last=corusadmin |date=2022-04-27 |title=The Delicious History Of The Halifax Donair |url=https://www.foodnetwork.ca/article/the-delicious-history-of-the-halifax-donair/ |access-date=2023-08-20 |website=Food Network Canada |language=en-CA}}</ref>

==Preparation==
[[File:Gyros_C5878.jpg|thumb|Gyros preparation]]
In Greece, gyros is normally made with pork, though other meats are used in other countries.<ref name="kremezi" /> Chicken is common, and lamb or beef may be found more rarely.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}} Typical American mass-produced gyros are made with finely ground beef mixed with lamb.<ref name="The New York Times"/>

For hand-made gyros, meat is cut into approximately round, thin, flat slices, which are then stacked on a spit and seasoned. Fat trimmings are usually interspersed. Spices may include [[cumin]], [[oregano]], [[thyme]], [[rosemary]], and others.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}} The pieces of meat, in the shape of an inverted cone, are placed on a tall vertical [[rotisserie]], which turns slowly in front of a source of heat or [[grilling|broiler]]. As the cone cooks, lower parts are basted with the juices running off the upper parts. The outside of the meat is sliced vertically in thin, crisp shavings when done.<ref name="kremezi" /><ref name="Albala 2011">{{cite book|first1=Ken|last1=Albala|title=Food Cultures of the World Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NTo6c_PJWRgC&pg=RA3-PA168|publisher=ABC-CLIO|date=2011 |isbn=9780313376269|via=Google Books}}</ref>

The rate of roasting can be adjusted by varying the intensity of the heat, the distance between the heat and the meat, and the speed of spit rotation, thus allowing the cook to adjust for varying rates of consumption.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

In Greece, it is customarily served in an oiled, lightly grilled piece of pita, rolled up with sliced tomatoes, chopped onions, and [[french fries|fried potatoes]], sometimes topped with [[tzatziki]], or, sometimes in [[northern Greece]], ketchup or mustard.<ref name="Kraig & Taylor Sen 2013">{{cite book|first1=Bruce|last1=Kraig|first2=Colleen|last2=Taylor Sen|title=Street Food around the World: An Encyclopedia of Food and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9XCjAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA150|publisher=ABC-CLIO|date=9 September 2013|isbn=9781598849554|via=Google Books|access-date=21 September 2019|archive-date=7 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230307201347/https://books.google.com/books?id=9XCjAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA150|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=A guide to ordering "gyros" in Greece |url=https://www.itinari.com/a-guide-to-ordering-gyros-in-greece-xfr8 |website=Itinari |date=26 May 2019 |access-date=12 December 2019 |archive-date=12 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212061503/https://www.itinari.com/a-guide-to-ordering-gyros-in-greece-xfr8 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Great Street Food in Thessaloniki: A Round-the-Clock Guide |url=http://www.greece-is.com/great-street-food-thessaloniki-round-clock-guide/ |website=Greece Is |date=4 July 2017 |access-date=12 December 2019 |archive-date=12 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212061501/http://www.greece-is.com/great-street-food-thessaloniki-round-clock-guide/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
