'''Tourtière''' ({{IPA|fr|tuʁtjɛʁ|lang}}, {{IPA|fr-CA|tuʁt͡sjaɛ̯ʁ|label=[[Quebec French]]:}}) is a [[Cuisine of Quebec|French Canadian]] [[meat pie]] dish originating from the [[Canadian province|province]] of [[Quebec]], usually made with minced [[pork]], [[veal]] or [[beef]] and potatoes. Wild game meat such as bear or venison is sometimes used.<ref>{{cite book | last=Geis | first=D.R. | title=Read My Plate: The Literature of Food | publisher=Lexington Books | year=2019 | isbn=978-1-4985-7444-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9e-YDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA3 | access-date=June 9, 2019 | page=3}}</ref> It is a traditional part of the Christmas ''[[réveillon]]'' and [[New Year's Eve#North America|New Year's Eve]] meal in [[Quebec]].<ref name=waverman/><ref name=yank/> It is also popular in [[New Brunswick]], and is sold in [[grocery store]]s across the rest of [[Canada]] all year long. It gets its name from the tourte, which is what it was originally made from. Though the name "tourtière" is derived from its filling, the tourte—the French name for the [[passenger pigeon]] that is now extinct in North America—was historically used as its filling before the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Pleins feux sur... la tourte voyageuse, une espèce disparue, et la tourtière, un mets bien connu! |url=https://mffp.gouv.qc.ca/jeunesse/tourte-voyageuse/ |access-date=2023-09-14 |website=Ministère des Forêts, de la Faune et des Parcs |language=fr-FR}}</ref>

Tourtière is not [[Cuisine of Quebec|exclusive to Quebec]]. It is a [[Traditional food|traditional]] [[French-Canadian]] dish served throughout [[Canada]] and the bordering areas of the [[United States]]. In the [[New England]] region of the U.S., especially in [[Maine]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Vermont]], [[New Hampshire]], and [[Massachusetts]] (e.g., [[Chicopee, Massachusetts|Chicopee]] and [[Attleboro, Massachusetts|Attleboro]]), late 19th and early 20th century, immigrants from Quebec introduced the dish.<ref name=newengland/>

There is no one correct filling; the meat depends on what is regionally available. In coastal areas, fish such as salmon is commonly used, whereas pork, beef, [[Rabbit as food|rabbit]] and game are often included inland. The name derives from the vessel in which it was originally cooked, a tourtière.<ref name=CooksInfo/><ref name=Casselman/><ref name="ArmstrongQuebec"/>{{rp|63}}

[[Tourtière du Lac-Saint-Jean]] has become the traditional and iconic dish of the region of [[Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Quebec|Saguenay]], [[Quebec]], since the [[World War II|Second World War]], and it has undergone several metamorphoses.

During the 18th century, "[[Sea-pie|sea pie]]" became popular among French and British colonists, and it seems to be "the direct forerunner of the tourtière of Lac-Saint-Jean".<ref>Jean-Pierre Lemasson in Cooke, Nathalie, editor. ''What's to Eat?: Entrées in Canadian Food History''. McGill-Queen's University Press, 2009, p.&nbsp;109</ref>

Tourtière has been called "an example of 'the cuisine of the occupied,' food that is French by way of the British, who took Quebec in 1759."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sifton |first1=Sam |title=A French-Canadian Christmas Carol |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/magazine/a-french-canadian-christmas-carol.html |access-date=June 27, 2020 |work=The New York Times Magazine |date=Dec 7, 2016}}</ref>

==Types of tourtière==
===Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean and Eastern Quebec===
[[File:Tourtiere meat pie.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Traditional French Canadian pork meat pie]]
The tourtières of the [[Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean]] area and Eastern Quebec are slow-cooked deep-dish meat pies made with [[potato]]es and various meats (often including wild game or turkey) cut into small cubes.<ref name=msc/>

Elsewhere in Quebec and the rest of Canada, this variety of tourtière is sometimes referred to, in French and in English, as ''[[Tourtière du Lac-Saint-Jean]]'' or ''tourtière saguenéenne'' to distinguish it from the varieties of tourtière with ground meat.
In the Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean area, however, the varieties of tourtière with ground meat are typically referred to as "pâté à la viande" ("meat pie"), while the name "tourtière" is reserved exclusively for their local variety.

===Montreal===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2023}}
Tourtière in [[Montreal]] is made with finely ground pork only (which can be hard to find as the meat is often ground too coarsely elsewhere). Water is added to the meat after browning, and [[cinnamon]] and [[clove]]s give it a distinctive flavour. Many people use [[ketchup]] as a condiment, though the tourtière is also often eaten with [[maple syrup]] or [[molasses]], or [[cranberry]] preserves.

Although it is less popular than the original tourtière and the tourtière du Lac-Saint-Jean, this version can also be commonly found throughout Canada and its surrounding areas.

===Manitoba===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2023}}
Tourtière is an integral part of holiday-time meals for [[French Canadian]]s in the [[Winnipeg]] neighbourhoods of [[Saint Boniface, Winnipeg|St. Boniface]] and [[St. Norbert, Winnipeg|St. Norbert]], as well as in Manitoba's rural [[Franco-Manitoban|Francophone]] areas. Browned meat is seasoned with varying combinations of [[Satureja|savory]], [[nutmeg]], cloves, cinnamon, [[celery salt]], dry [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]], [[salt]] and pepper.

===Acadia===
[[Acadian]] tourtière, or '''pâté à la viande''' (pâté is casserole or pie), is a [[pork pie]] that may also contain chicken, hare and beef.<ref name=Museeacadien/> Pâté à la viande varies from region to region in [[New Brunswick]], [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Prince Edward Island]]. In Petit-Rocher and Campbellton the dish is prepared in small pie plates and known as ''petits cochons'' (little pigs).<ref name=Museeacadien/>
