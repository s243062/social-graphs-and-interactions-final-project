'''Waterzooi''' ({{IPA|nl|ˈʋaːtərˌzoːi|lang|Nl-waterzooi.ogg}}) is a [[soup]] from [[Belgian cuisine|Belgium]] and originating in [[Flanders]]. The second part of the name derives from the [[Middle Dutch]] terms ''sode'', ''zo(o)de ''and ''soot'', words referring to the act of boiling or the ingredients being boiled.<ref name="vdew">''van Dale Etymologisch Woordenboek'', p.965, dr. P.A.F. van Veen & drs. Nicoline van der Sijs, 1989, {{ISBN|90-6648-312-1}}</ref> It is sometimes called ''Gentse Waterzooi'' which refers to the Belgian town of [[Ghent]] where it originated. The original dish is often made of [[Fish as food|fish]], either freshwater or sea, (known as ''Viszooitje''), though today [[Chicken (food)|chicken]] ''waterzooi'' (''Kippenwaterzooi'') is more common. The most accepted theory is that rivers around Ghent became too polluted and the fish there disappeared.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gentblogt.be/2006/11/17/gentse-waterzooi|title=Gentse Waterzooi » Gentblogt|work=gentblogt.be}}</ref> [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] ate the rich dish, even after suffering from [[gout]].<ref>Patricia Carson, ''Fair Face of Flanders'' (Belgian Art Research Institute, 2001), p. 124.</ref>

==Varieties==
All versions are based on a soup-base of [[egg yolk]], [[cream]], and thickened vegetable [[broth]]. The stew itself contains fish or chicken, vegetables including [[carrot]]s, [[onion]]s, [[celery]], [[Leek (vegetable)|leeks]], [[potato]]es and herbs such as parsley, thyme, bay-leaves and sage.<ref>{{cite web|title=Le Waterzooi Gantois (cuisine de Gand)|url=http://users.skynet.be/la_cuisine_belge/waterzooi_gantois_cuisine_belge.html|publisher=La Bonne Cuisine|access-date=11 March 2013}}</ref>

===Fish===
Originally, [[burbot]] was used but this fish had all but disappeared from the rivers until its recent return due to conservation efforts.<ref>{{cite news|title=Na meer dan 40 jaar opnieuw kwabaal in Grote Nete|url=http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/2661/Dieren/article/detail/1126480/2010/06/29/Na-meer-dan-40-jaar-opnieuw-kwabaal-in-Grote-Nete.dhtml|access-date=11 March 2013|newspaper=[[Het Laatste Nieuws]]|date=29 June 2010}}</ref> Nowadays, fish such as [[Eel as food|eel]], [[Esox|pike]], [[carp]] and [[bass (fish)|bass]] are used, though other fish such as [[Cod as food|cod]], [[Lophius|monkfish]], or [[halibut]] can be used. ''Gentse Waterzooi van Tarbot'' includes [[turbot]].

===Meat===
Chicken is a popular alternative to fish in the recipe, though the rest of the ingredients remain the same.
