'''Butter''' is a [[dairy product]] made from the fat and protein components of [[Churning (butter)|churned]] [[cream]]. It is a semi-solid [[emulsion]] at [[room temperature]], consisting of approximately 81% [[butterfat]]. It is used at room temperature as a [[spread (food)|spread]], melted as a [[condiment]], and used as a [[Cooking fat|fat]] in baking, sauce-making, [[pan frying]], and other cooking procedures.

Most frequently made from [[cow's milk]], butter can also be manufactured from the milk of other mammals, including [[Sheep milk|sheep]], [[Goat milk|goats]], [[Buffalo milk|buffalo]], and [[Yak milk|yaks]]. It is made by churning milk or cream to separate the fat globules from the [[buttermilk]]. [[Dairy salt|Salt]] has been added to butter since antiquity to help [[Food preservation|preserve]] it, particularly when being transported; salt may still play a preservation role but is less important today as the entire supply chain is usually refrigerated.

==Production==
{{Main|Churning (butter)}}
[[File:Churning butter.jpg|thumb|upright|Churning cream into butter using a hand-held mixer]]
[[Homogenization (chemistry)|Unhomogenized]] milk and cream contain [[butterfat]] in [[microscopic]] globules. These globules are surrounded by membranes made of [[phospholipid]]s ([[fatty acid]] [[emulsifier]]s) and [[protein]]s, which prevent the fat in milk from pooling together into a single mass. Butter is produced by agitating cream, which damages these membranes and allows the milk fats to conjoin, separating from the other parts of the cream. Variations in the production method will create butters with different consistencies, mostly due to the butterfat composition in the finished product. Butter contains fat in three separate forms: free butterfat, butterfat [[crystals]], and undamaged fat globules. In the finished product, different proportions of these forms result in different consistencies within the butter; butters with many crystals are harder than butters dominated by free fats.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}

Churning produces small butter grains floating in the water-based portion of the cream. This watery liquid is called [[buttermilk]], although the buttermilk most commonly sold today is instead directly fermented skimmed milk.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1 December 2006|title=A comparative study of the fractionation of regular buttermilk and whey buttermilk by microfiltration|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0260877405004966|journal=Journal of Food Engineering|language=en|volume=77|issue=3|pages=521–528|doi=10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2005.06.065|issn=0260-8774|last1=Morin|first1=P.|last2=Pouliot|first2=Y.|last3=Jiménez-Flores|first3=R.|access-date=7 June 2021|archive-date=7 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210607013819/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0260877405004966|url-status=live|url-access=subscription}}</ref> The buttermilk is drained off; sometimes more buttermilk is removed by rinsing the grains with water. Then the grains are "worked": pressed and kneaded together. When prepared manually, this is done using wooden boards called [[scotch hands]]. This consolidates the butter into a solid mass and breaks up embedded pockets of buttermilk or water into tiny droplets.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}

Commercial butter is about 80% butterfat and 15% water; traditionally-made butter may have as little as 65% fat and 30% water. Butterfat is a mixture of [[triglyceride]], a [[triester]] derived from [[glycerol]], and three of any of several [[fatty acid]] groups.<ref>Rolf Jost "Milk and Dairy Products" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. {{doi|10.1002/14356007.a16_589.pub3}}</ref> [[Annatto]] is sometimes added by U.S. butter manufacturers without declaring it on the label because the U.S. allows butter to have an undisclosed flavorless and natural coloring agent (whereas all other foods in the U.S. must label coloring agents).<ref>Butter: A Rich History.

Before modern factory butter making, cream was usually collected from several milkings and was therefore several days old and somewhat fermented by the time it was made into butter. Butter made in this traditional way (from a fermented cream) is known as '''cultured butter'''. During fermentation, the cream naturally sours as [[bacteria]] convert [[milk sugar]]s into [[lactic acid]]. The fermentation process produces additional aroma compounds, including [[diacetyl]], which makes for a fuller-flavored and more "buttery" tasting product.<ref name="McGee">{{cite book|last=McGee|first=Harold|author-link=Harold McGee|title=On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen|date=2004|publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]]|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-684-80001-1|lccn=2004058999|oclc=56590708}}</ref>{{rp|page=35}}

=== Clarified butter ===
{{Main|Clarified butter}}
[[File:Butterschmalz-2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Liquid [[clarified butter]]]]

Clarified butter has almost all of its water and milk solids removed, leaving almost-pure butterfat. Clarified butter is made by heating butter to its [[melting point]] and then allowing it to cool; after settling, the remaining components separate by density. At the top, [[whey protein]]s form a skin, which is removed. The resulting butterfat is then poured off from the mixture of water and [[casein]] proteins that settle to the bottom.<ref name="McGee" />{{rp|page=37}}

[[Ghee]] is clarified butter that has been heated to around 120&nbsp;°C (250&nbsp;°F) after the water evaporated, turning the milk solids brown. This process flavors the ghee, and also produces [[antioxidant]]s that help protect it from rancidity. Because of this, ghee can be kept for six to eight months under normal conditions.<ref name="McGee"/>{{rp|page=37}}

{{anchor|Whey butter}}

===Whey butter===
Cream may be separated (usually by a centrifuge or a sedimentation) from [[whey]] instead of milk, as a [[byproduct]] of cheese-making. Whey butter may be made from whey cream. Whey cream and butter have a lower fat content and taste more salty, tangy and "cheesy".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oukosher.org/index.php/common/article/everything_is_in_butter/|title=Article on sweet cream, whey cream, and the butters they produce|work=Kosher|access-date=24 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220100350/http://oukosher.org/index.php/common/article/everything_is_in_butter/|archive-date=20 February 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> They are also cheaper to make than "sweet" cream and butter.

Bread and butter became common fare among the middle class and the English, in particular, gained a reputation for their liberal use of melted butter as a sauce with meat and vegetables.<ref name="McGee"/>{{rp|page=33}}

In antiquity, butter was used for fuel in lamps, as a substitute for oil. The ''Butter Tower'' of [[Rouen Cathedral]] was erected in the early 16th century when Archbishop [[Georges d'Amboise]] authorized the burning of butter during Lent, instead of oil, which was scarce at the time.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Pantropheon or a History of Food and its Preparation in Ancient Times |last=Soyer |first=Alexis|year=1977|orig-date=1853|publisher=Paddington Press |location=Wisbech, Cambs. |isbn=978-0-448-22976-8|page=172}}</ref>

Across northern Europe, butter was sometimes packed into barrels ([[wikt:firkin|firkins]]) and buried in [[peat bog]]s, perhaps for years. Such "[[bog butter]]" would develop a strong flavor as it aged, but remain edible, in large part because of the cool, airless, [[antiseptic]] and [[acid]]ic environment of a peat bog. Firkins of such buried butter are a common archaeological find in Ireland; the [[National Museum of Ireland – Archaeology]] has some containing "a grayish cheese-like substance, partially hardened, not much like butter, and quite free from putrefaction." The practice was most common in Ireland in the 11th to 14th centuries; it had ended entirely before the 19th century.<ref name=WE/>

===Industrialization===
[[File:GustafDeLaval.jpg|thumb|upright|Gustaf de Laval's [[centrifuge|centrifugal]] cream separator sped up the butter-making process.]]
Until the 19th century, the vast majority of butter was made by hand, on farms, for farm family use or to sell. They used wood presses with carved decoration identifying the producer to press butter into pucks or small bricks to sell at nearby markets or general stores.  This practice continued until production was mechanized and butter was produced in less decorative stick form.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hale|first=Sarah Josepha Buell|title=Mrs. Hale's new cook book|url=https://archive.org/details/b28075195|year=1857}}</ref>

Like Ireland, France became well known for its butter, particularly in [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]]. Butter consumption in London in the mid-1840s was estimated at 15,357 tons annually.<ref>''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol.III'', London (1847) Charles Knight, p.975.</ref>

The first butter factories appeared in the United States in the early 1860s, after the successful introduction of cheese factories a decade earlier. In the late 1870s, the [[centrifuge|centrifugal]] [[cream separator]] was introduced, marketed most successfully by Swedish engineer [[Carl Gustaf Patrik de Laval]].<ref>Edwards, Everett E.

Butter consumption declined in most western nations during the 20th century, mainly because of the rising popularity of [[margarine]], which is less expensive and, until recent years, was perceived as being healthier. In the United States, margarine consumption overtook butter during the 1950s,<ref>Web Exhibits: Butter.

==Production==

In 2022, world production of butter made from cow milk was 6 million [[tonne]]s, led by the United States with 13% of the total (table).

==Storage==

Normal butter softens to a spreadable consistency around 15&nbsp;°C (60&nbsp;°F), well above [[refrigerator]] temperatures. The "butter compartment" found in many refrigerators may be one of the warmer sections inside, but it still leaves butter quite hard. Until recently, many refrigerators sold in New Zealand featured a "butter conditioner", a compartment kept warmer than the rest of the refrigerator—but still cooler than room temperature—with a small heater.<ref>[http://www.ukwhitegoods.co.uk/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=668 Bring back butter conditioners] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927025358/http://www.ukwhitegoods.co.uk/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=668 |date=27 September 2007 }}. Retrieved 27 November 2005. The feature has been phased out for [[energy conservation]] reasons.</ref> Keeping butter tightly wrapped delays rancidity, which is hastened by exposure to light or air, and also helps prevent it from picking up other odors. Wrapped butter has a [[shelf life]] of several months at refrigerator temperatures.<ref>[http://www.eatbydate.com/dairy/spreads/butter-shelf-life-expiration-date/ How Long Does Butter Last?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006073213/http://www.eatbydate.com/dairy/spreads/butter-shelf-life-expiration-date/# |date=6 October 2014 }}.

==In cooking and gastronomy==
[[File:Spargel sauce hollandaise.jpg|thumb|[[Hollandaise sauce]] served over white asparagus and potatoes]]
Butter has been considered indispensable in [[French cuisine]] since the 17th century.<ref>Jean-Robert Pitte, ''French Gastronomy: The History and Geography of a Passion'', {{isbn|0231124163}}, p. 94</ref> Chefs and cooks have extolled its importance: [[Fernand Point]] said "Donnez-moi du beurre, encore du beurre, toujours du beurre!" ('Give me butter, more butter, still more butter!').<ref name="belleret">Robert Belleret, ''Paul Bocuse, l'épopée d'un chef'', 2019, {{isbn|2809825904}}</ref> [[Julia Child]] said, "With enough butter, anything is good."<ref>Katie Armour, "Top 20 Julia Child Quotes", ''Matchbook'', [https://www.matchbookmag.com/daily/47-top-20-julia-child-quotes April 15, 2013] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200124083306/http://www.matchbookmag.com/daily/47-top-20-julia-child-quotes |date=24 January 2020 }}</ref>

Melted butter plays an important role in the preparation of [[sauce]]s, notably in French cuisine. ''[[Beurre noisette]]'' (hazelnut butter) and ''[[Beurre noir]]'' (black butter) are sauces of melted butter cooked until the milk solids and sugars have turned golden or dark brown; they are often finished with an addition of vinegar or [[lemon juice]].<ref name="McGee"/>{{rp|page=36}} [[Hollandaise]] and [[Béarnaise sauce|béarnaise]] sauces are [[emulsion]]s of [[egg (food)|egg yolk]] and melted butter. Hollandaise and béarnaise sauces are stabilized with the powerful [[emulsifiers]] in the egg yolks, but butter itself contains enough emulsifiers—mostly remnants of the fat globule membranes—to form a stable emulsion on its own.<ref name="McGee"/>{{rp|page=635–636}}

''[[Beurre blanc]]'' (white butter) is made by whisking butter into reduced vinegar or wine, forming an emulsion with the texture of thick cream. ''[[Beurre monté]]'' (prepared butter) is melted but still [[emulsified]] butter; it lends its name to the practice of "mounting" a sauce with butter: whisking cold butter into any water-based sauce at the end of cooking, giving the sauce a thicker body and a glossy shine—as well as a buttery taste.<ref name="McGee"/>{{rp|page=632}}

Butter is used for [[sautéing]] and [[frying]], although its milk solids brown and burn above 150&nbsp;°C (250&nbsp;°F)—a rather low temperature for most applications. The [[smoke point]] of butterfat is around 200&nbsp;°C (400&nbsp;°F), so clarified butter or ghee is better suited to frying.<ref name="McGee"/>{{rp|page=37}} 
{{cookbook}}
Butter fills several roles in [[baking]], including making possible a range of textures, making chemical leavenings work better, tenderizing proteins, and enhancing the tastes of other ingredients. It is used in a similar manner to other solid fats like [[lard]], [[suet]], or [[shortening]], but has a flavor that may better complement sweet baked goods.{{Cn|date=December 2024}}

Butter (salted during manufacturing) is 16% water, 81% [[fat]], and 1% [[protein (nutrient)|protein]], with negligible [[carbohydrate]]s. Of the {{cvt|81|g}} of total fat, [[saturated fat]] is 51 g, [[monounsaturated fat]] is 21 g, [[polyunsaturated fat]] is 3 g, [[trans fat]] is 3 g, and trans fat designated as ''"18:1 t"'' is 3 g, for a total of 81 g (source for table).

In a reference amount of {{cvt|100|g}}, salted butter supplies 717 [[calorie]]s and 76% of the [[Daily Value]] (DV) for [[vitamin A]], 15% DV for [[vitamin E]], and 28% DV for [[sodium in biology|sodium]], with no other [[micronutrient]]s in significant content (table). In 100 grams, salted butter contains 215 mg of [[cholesterol]] (table).
