Rooted in [[Minangkabau cuisine|Minangkabau]], rendang spread across [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] through the journeys of [[Minangkabau businesspeople|Minangkabau traders]], who carried the dish with them as they migrated and built new trading networks.<ref name="Fadly Rahman Journal"/> Minangkabau traders frequently carried rendang as provisions, allowing the dish to travel naturally through cultural exchange between the [[West Sumatra]] and [[Malay Peninsula]]. In 20th century, the deeply rooted migratory tradition of the [[Minangkabau people]] further maintained and contributed to the dish's spread, as they introduced Minang-style rendang to the various places they settled.<ref name="Fadly Rahman Journal"/> The dish carries strong Indian influences, as many of its key ingredients are staples in Indian cooking.<ref name="Treasures of Sumatra"/> The introduction of chili peppers by the Portuguese through the [[Columbian exchange]] after the [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|capture of Malacca]] in 1511, played a key role in the evolution of rendang.<ref name="Fadly Rahman Journal"/>

As a signature dish in Southeast Asian Muslim cuisines—Malay, Minangkabau (as ''samba randang''), and [[Filipino cuisine#Regional dishes#Mindanao|Moro]] (as ''riyandang'')—rendang is traditionally served at ceremonial occasions and festive gatherings, such as wedding feasts and ''Hari Raya'' ([[Eid al-Fitr]] and [[Eid al-Adha]]). Nowadays, it is commonly served at food stalls and restaurants as a side dish with rice. In 2009, Malaysia recognized rendang as a heritage food.<ref name="Rendang 2009">{{Cite web|url=https://www.heritage.gov.my/en/pengisytiharan-2009.html|title=Warisan Kebangsaan 2009|website=heritage.gov.my}}</ref> Indonesia granted rendang cultural heritage status in 2013<ref name="Randang 2013">{{Cite web|url=https://kwriu.kemdikbud.go.id/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/MINISTERIAL-DECREE-OF-THE-MEC-NUMBER-238-OF-2013-ICHI-2013.pdf|title=Warisan Budaya Tak Benda (WBTB) Indonesia|website=kwriu.kemdikbud.go.id}}</ref> and officially declared it one of its national dishes in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thejakartapost.com/travel/2018/09/20/tourism-ministry-declares-five-dishes-national-food.html|title=Tourism Ministry declares five dishes national food|website=www.thejakartapost.com}}</ref>

== Etymology and definitions ==
Both the ''[[Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia]]'' and ''[[Kamus Dewan]]'' define ''rendang'' as meat cooked with spices and coconut milk until completely dry;<ref>{{cite web |title=Rendang |url=https://kbbi.web.id/rendang |website=kbbi.web.id}}</ref><ref name="Rendang DBP">{{cite web |title=Rendang |url=https://prpm.dbp.gov.my/Cari1?keyword=rendang |website=prpm.dbp.gov.my}}</ref> ''rendang'' is also a verb for the action of frying in a pan with or without oil (only in Kamus Dewan). Food historian Khir Johari explains that ''rendang'' had a broader meaning for frying in general before the prevalence of ''goreng''. For instance, [[Abdullah Abdul Kadir|Munshi Abdullah]] in his 1838 [[Kisah Pelayaran Abdullah ke Kelantan|travelogue to Kelantan]] described the [[Terengganuan Malays|people of Terengganu]] enjoying ''{{lang|ms|rendang pisang}}'' ([[Banana fritter|fried banana fritters]]) — what the Malays now called {{lang|ms|goreng pisang}} or {{lang|ms|pisang goreng}}.<ref name="Khir Johari Book"/>{{rp|191–193}}

A 1960 article from Azizah Ja'afar in [[Berita Harian]]'s Dewan Wanita section{{refn|group=n|Azizah Ja'afar was head of the [[Majlis Amanah Rakyat|Rural Industrial Development Authority]]'s Taman Asuhan Wanita who compiled terms that according to her were used at the Sekolah Mentadbir Rumah Tangga in Johor Bahru and at the Taman Asuhan Wanita in Kuala Lumpur.<ref name="Azizah Ja'afar">{{Cite web|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/article/beritaharian19600201-1.2.54|title=DALAM LAPANGAN MASAK MEMASAK PUN PERLU DI-AKUI|website=eresources.nlb.gov.sg}}</ref>}} lists ''rendang'' as "frying with a generous amount of oil", similar to ''{{lang|ms|merendang pisang}}'' or ''[[jemput-jemput]]'' (fried fritters), where the things being fried would float in the hot oil. This distinguishes ''rendang'' from ''goreng'', which involves little to no oil, as seen in dishes like ''[[nasi goreng]]'' or ''[[mee goreng|mi goreng]]''. Additionally, "rendang" is also the name of a traditional Malay dish known for its rich, spicy flavors, such as ''rendang santan'' (meat cooked in coconut milk), and ''rendang pedas'' (spiced meat).<ref name="Rendang Istilah Rumah Tangga">{{Cite news |author=Azizah Ja'afar |title=Istilah Rumah Tangga  |url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/page/beritaharian19600208-1.1.6 |date=8 February 1960 |newspaper=Berita Harian |page=6}}</ref>

== History ==
=== Timeline of documentation ===
==== The first known use of the word ====
Food historian Fadly Rahman traces the earliest reference to rendang to the early 16th-century Malay manuscript ''[[Hikayat Amir Hamzah]]'' associated with the [[Malacca Sultanate]]{{refn|group=n|In the 15th and 16th centuries, at the height of the Malacca Sultanate's power, its capital became a key Asian port, controlling much of the region along the Malacca Straits (Malay Peninsula and Sumatra).}} (1400–1528).<ref name="Fadly Rahman Journal">{{Cite journal | last = Rahman | first = Fadly | title = Tracing the origins of rendang and its development | journal = Journal of Ethnic Foods | date=1 September 2020 |volume=7 | issue=28 |doi=10.1186/s42779-020-00065-1| doi-access = free }}</ref> Written during the spread of Islam in the Malay world, this adaptation of the Persian [[Hamzanama]] was later compiled into Malay and intended to inspire Malacca's soldiers in their fight against the Portuguese in 1511. In Malay version, there mentioned the words "rendang" and "merendang" (roasting) which is quoted as follows:<ref name="Fadly Rahman Journal"/>

{{Verse translation|lang=msa|...Khoja Buzurjumhur Hakim pun pergi pula ke kedai orang merendang daging kambing, lalu ia berkata ‘beri apalah daging kambing rendang ini barang segumpal...
|...Khoja Buzurjumhur Hakim went to the stall where people were ''merendang'' (roasting) goat meat and said, 'give me just a piece of this goat meat ''rendang''...'}}

This passage suggests that ''merendang'' refers to a cooking technique, while ''rendang'' describes the resulting dish have been part of the Malay vocabulary since the 16th century.<ref name="Fadly Rahman Journal"/>

==== As a tradition in royal Malay banquets ====
Khir Johari notes that {{lang|ms|rendang tumis}} is mentioned in the ''[[Hikayat Hang Tuah]]'', a classic Malay literary masterpiece from around the 17th-century.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hooker |first=Virginia Matheson |date=2016 |editor-last=Fleet |editor-first=Kate |title=Hang Tuah, Hikayat |url=https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-3/*-COM_30299 |journal=Encyclopaedia of Islam |language=en |edition=3 |doi=10.1163/1573-3912_ei3_COM_30299 |access-date=20 June 2023 |via=Brill|url-access=subscription }}</ref> Another manuscript, ''[[Hikayat Awang Sulung Merah Muda]]'', reflects 18th-century life and cooking traditions. In the narration, a prince hunts and captures a ''[[Tragulus|pelanduk]]'' (mouse deer), which is then prepared in various styles — ''tumis'', ''rendang'', and ''gulai''. Tumis refers to a dish that is more like soup, while rendang resembles the slow-cooked dish we know today.

==== Made popular through cookbooks and newspapers ====
By the early 20th century, rendang recipes began appearing in published cookbooks and newspapers across [[British Malaya]] and the [[Dutch East Indies]]. On 2 February 1917, [[Soenting Melajoe]] featured an article by Datoek Soetan Maharadja, noting that  Europeans residing in Palembang, Batavia, and Kupang had written to Minangkabau women, sending money through the magazine's editor to request the preparation and delivery of “rendang Alam Minangkabau”.<ref name="Tracing the origins of rendang and">{{cite journal |last1=Rahman |first1=Fadly |title=Tracing the origins of rendang and its development |journal=Journal of Ethnic Foods |pages=28 |doi=10.1186/s42779-020-00065-1 |date=1 September 2020|volume=7 |doi-access=free }}</ref> ''The "Mem's" Own Cookery Book: 420 Tried and Economical Recipes for Malaya'' (1920) by Mrs. Kinsey, published in Singapore, included a recipe for "rundang" that used curry powder and could be served with spaghetti.{{refn|group=n|''The "Mem's" Own Cookery Book'' was first published in 1920 by Mrs. Kinsey, wife of British colonial official William Edward Kinsey, who was based in Malaya.

==== Contemporary era ====
[[File:Sari Bundo Surakarta.JPG|thumb|left| "Padang restaurant" in Surakarta.]]

In Indonesia, rendang is mainly associated with Minangkabau. The popularity of rendang grew with the presence of Minangkabau-style ''lepau'' (food stalls) in areas where Minangkabau migrants settled. Their presence in new areas played a significant role in popularizing rendang as a signature dish of West Sumatra. Today, rendang stands as the iconic menu item in Minangkabau restaurants, often accompanied by other meat-based dishes.<ref name="Fadly Rahman Journal"/>

In Malaysia and Singapore, rendang is often paired with iconic dishes such as [[nasi lemak]] — a national favorite — or [[lemang]], Malay glutinous rice cooked in bamboo, particularly during festivals like Hari Raya.<ref name="Lemang dan ketupat pembuka selera sa-tiap pagi raya">{{Cite web|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/article/beritaharian19671226-1.2.77|title=Lemang dan ketupat pembuka selera sa-tiap pagi raya|website=eresources.nlb.gov.sg |publisher=[[Berita Harian]] |date=26 December 1967 |page=10 |access-date=29 March 2025}} Microflim: NL5342.</ref> However, rendang has also become a staple in Malay eateries.<ref>https://mytrip.my/beef-rendang/</ref> It even features on the menus of international restaurants, showcasing its enduring appeal and cultural significance.<ref name="Khir Johari Book"/>

=== Theories on origin ===

==== From West Sumatra ====
Gusti Asnan notes that the earliest mention of ''randang'' in Minangkabau culture appears in J.L. van der Toorn's dictionary from 1891. However, he believes that it had been familiar to the Minangkabau people long before this record.<ref name="Gusti Asnan">{{citation | last = Asnan | first = Gusti | title = Sejarah Rendang Disajikan pada "Semiloka Penyusunan Naskah Akademik Randang Menuju Warisan Dunia" | year = 2021 | url = http://repo.unand.ac.id/45069/1/Bahan%20Presentasi%20%28PPT%29%20Semiloka%20Penyusunan%20Naskah%20Akademik%20Randang%20Menuju%20Warisan%20Dunia.pdf}}</ref>

Fadly Rahman inferred that rendang is closely associated with the Islamic tradition, the migratory culture, and the commercial ethics of the Minangkabau people. An early reference to “Rendang Minang”, a dish renowned for its ability to last for months and favored by migrants and traders, dates to 1917.<ref name="Fadly Rahman Journal"/>

==== Possible Indian influences ====
Rendang, often regarded as an exclusive Minangkabau dish, is heavily influenced by Indian cuisine. Many of its ingredients, such as cardamom, coriander, garlic, shallots, chili, ginger, galangal, lemongrass, bay leaves, tamarind, and turmeric, are staples in Indian cooking.<ref name="Treasures of Sumatra">{{cite book |last1=Utomo |first1=Bambang Budi |title=Treasures of Sumatra |last2=Karim |first2=Mulyawan |last3=Sundari |first3=Ekowati |publisher=Direktorat Jenderal Kebudayaan |year=2009 |isbn=9786024372255 |pages=24}}</ref> Winarno and Agustinah believe rendang may have been inspired by curry, a dish combining meat and spices in North India. Indian traders who traveled to West Sumatra brought their culinary traditions with them, possibly influencing the development of rendang.<ref name="The treasure of Minangkabau">{{Cite journal | last1 = Nurmufida | first1 = Muthia | last2 = Wangrimen | first2 = Gervasius H. | last3 = Reinalta | first3 = Risty | last4 = Leonardi | first4 = Kevin | title = Rendang: The treasure of Minangkabau | journal = Journal of Ethnic Foods | year = 2017 | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = 232–235 | doi = 10.1016/j.jef.2017.10.005 | doi-access = free }}</ref> It likely traces its roots to Indian merchants, though it has undergone multiple layers of evolution over time. During this period, Malaysia and Indonesia had yet to emerge as distinct geographical entities, resulting in a deep shared culinary and cultural history.<ref name="Kristang"/>

==== Possible Portuguese influences ====
[[File:Portuguese discoveries and explorationsV2en.png|thumb|center|upright=3|Goa, Malacca, and Macau were key stops along the Portuguese spice trade routes (in blue) in the 16th and 17th centuries. The Portuguese also introduced [[chili peppers|chili]] to Asia, and these quickly became integral to local cuisines.<ref name="Boileau"/>{{rp|11–12}}]]

According to culinary historian Janet P. Boileau, Portuguese cooks had a unique method of frying meat after braising, unlike the Arab technique of frying before boiling. This approach, adopted by Luso-Asian cooks, may have influenced local culinary practices including rendang.<ref name="Boileau">{{cite thesis | last = Boileau | first = Janet | title = A culinary history of the Portuguese Eurasians: the origins of Luso-Asian cuisine in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. | year = 2010 | s2cid = 166582078 }}</ref>{{rp|61}} When the [[Portuguese Malacca|Portuguese ruled Malacca]] (1511–1641), they brought various cultural and culinary influences to the [[Malay Peninsula]] and neighboring [[Sumatra]]. Portuguese cuisine introduced preservation techniques and terms like ''[[acar]]'', ''[[Shrimp paste|belacan]]'', ''[[Sponge cake|baulu]]'', and ''[[butter|mentega]]''.<ref name="Fadly Rahman Journal"/><ref name="Fadly Rahman Book">{{cite book | last = Rahman | first = Fadly | title = Jejak rasa Nusantara sejarah makanan Indonesia | publisher = Gramedia Pustaka Utama | pages = 51–52 | year = 2023 | isbn=9786020335216}}</ref>

After [[Siege of Malacca (1641)|Malacca fell to the Dutch]], the [[Kristang people|Kristang community]] — descendants of Malaccan Portuguese settlers — faced economic challenges and sought cost-effective ways to prepare food. They adopted techniques similar to those used by their counterparts in [[Portuguese Macau]], such as frying meat with minimal water until it blackened, resembling ''bafado''.

Rendang was officially recognized by Malaysia as a National Heritage food in 2009,<ref name="Rendang 2009"/> celebrated for its rich diversity across the country. ''Rendang campur'' was declared in 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heritage.gov.my/en/pengisytiharan-2012.html|title=Warisan Kebangsaan 2012|website=heritage.gov.my}}</ref> ''Randang'' from West Sumatra was granted cultural heritage status in 2013 by the Indonesian government.<ref name="Randang 2013"/> Rendang holds a special place in Malay and Minangkabau society, celebrated for its deep cultural significance and often reserved for special occasions such as Eid, weddings, and important gatherings.<ref name="Rendang nan Enak itu"/><ref name="Lemang dan ketupat pembuka selera sa-tiap pagi raya"/> In villages, making rendang is a communal effort, with large amounts of meat being cooked in a giant cast-iron cauldron. During the final stage, people work together, stirring with a wooden oar-like spatula for hours to ensure even cooking. This slow frying removes moisture, allowing the meat to absorb the spices while preventing burning or breaking.<ref name="Rendang Singapura Stories"/>

[[File:RENDANG AYAM.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|Oil gives rendang its signature glossy finish.<ref name="Khir Johari Book"/>{{rp|351}} Turmeric leaves are sliced as garnishes.]]

The essence of rendang lies in its meticulous cooking process, where meat or chicken is slow-cooked with fresh coconut milk, aromatic spices, and herbs. This harmonious blend of ingredients represents unity and balance within the Malay community. Beyond its exquisite taste, rendang embodies hospitality, cultural pride, and a connection to heritage.<ref name="KTM">{{cite book | last = Panel Penulis The Patriots | title = Kitab Tamadun Melayu| year = 2019 | publisher = Patriots Publishing Sdn Bhd| isbn = 9789671652893}}</ref> Malay food traditions make the most of coconuts, knowing that the best coconut milk comes from mature coconuts.

Rendang is traditionally associated with festive occasions and ceremonial meals. For example, it took center stage in the royal celebration during the ''Santapan Nasi Berastakona'' at [[Istana Iskandariah]] following the [[Sultan of Perak|Perak Sultan]]'s coronation. Various styles of rendang were served alongside layers of yellow, white, and black glutinous rice in an intricately carved silver octagonal vessel called the ''Astakona'', symbolizing sustenance and harmony. Notable Perak variations of rendang such as ''rendang tok'', ''rendang ayam'', and ''rendang udang'', were thoughtfully prepared and arranged around the rice centerpiece, showcasing the dish's ceremonial importance.<ref name="JPM Book"/>

[[File:Memasak Rendang.jpg|thumb|left| A group of women preparing ''randang'' in West Sumatra.]]

In [[Minangkabau culture]], there are three types of food: ''makanan adat'' (traditional ceremonial food), ''samba adat'' (ceremonial dishes), and ''makan beradat'' (formal dining traditions). Rendang belongs to the category of ''samba adat'', which is essential for traditional ceremonies. One key example is ''rendang daging kerbau'' (buffalo meat rendang), which symbolizes legitimacy in cultural rituals. Buffalo meat is particularly significant and cannot be substituted, as it is tied to the recognition of a tribal leader's title.<ref name="Rendang nan Enak itu"/>{{rp|16}}

Rendang, a celebrated dish from the Minangkabau region, is tied to a folk tale about Princess Puti Ranti, a humble and skilled cook. In a royal cooking competition, jealous rivals sabotaged her ''gulai'', causing it to blacken. Despite this, the dish turned out delicious, and Puti Ranti won the contest. The delighted king named the dish ''rendang'', combining her name and that of her future fiancé, Danggala. This story reflects Rendang's significance as a symbol of heritage and pride in Minangkabau culture.<ref name="Rendang nan Enak itu"/>{{rp|5–7}}

Each ingredient in rendang is reported to carry philosophical symbolism in Minangkabau culture and represents its key values and principles that reflect the way of life and social structure of the people.

Rendang has a special position in the culture of the [[Minangkabau people]]. The Minangkabau people are famous for their [[:id:Merantau|Merantau]] culture, which is to leave their hometowns in [[West Sumatra]]. Minang people in the land area used to travel from [[Minangkabau Highlands]] to [[Malay Peninsula]], [[Singapore]] and [[Java]] which took about a month through the river and sea, because along the way there were no villages, the nomads prepared a long-lasting food supply, namely Rendang.<ref name="Sejarah Rendang Merantau"/><ref name="binus_makna-dibalik-kenikmatan-sepotong-rendang">{{Cite web|url=https://binus.ac.id/character-building/2021/01/makna-dibalik-kenikmatan-sepotong-rendang/|title=MAKNA DIBALIK KENIKMATAN SEPOTONG RENDANG|website=binus.ac.id}}</ref>

However, what often goes unnoticed is how this claim transforms rendang from a symbol of culinary excellence into a dish laden with political significance.<ref name="Fadly Rahman Journal"/>

In 2018, a judge on [[MasterChef UK]] sparked controversy by criticizing a contestant's rendang for not being "crispy enough". The remark drew strong reactions from Malaysians, Singaporeans, and Indonesians, leading to widespread debate. In response, some local eateries even created their own crispy versions of rendang.<ref name="Singapore Infopedia">{{cite web |title=Rendang |url=https://www.nlb.gov.sg/main/article-detail?cmsuuid=0f09b507-3994-4487-8f70-6c82037846a1 |website=National Library Board}}</ref>

=== Philosophy ===
Rendang holds deep philosophical significance for the Minang people of [[West Sumatra]], embodying the values of deliberation and consensus (''musyawarah dan mufakat''). It is rooted in four key ingredients, each symbolizing an essential pillar of Minangkabau society. ''Dagiang'' (beef) represents the ''niniak mamak'' (traditional tribal leaders), ''karambia'' (coconut) symbolizes the ''cadiak pandai'' (intellectuals), ''lado'' (chili) stands for the ''alim ulama'' (religious scholars who strictly uphold teachings), and ''cook'' (spices) represents the broader [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] community.<ref name="Sejarah Rendang Merantau">{{Cite web|url=https://www.kompas.com/food/read/2022/01/06/113400575/sejarah-rendang-berkaitan-dengan-tradisi-merantau-orang-minangkabau|title=Sejarah Rendang, Berkaitan dengan Tradisi Merantau Orang Minangkabau|website=kompas.com|date=6 January 2022 |last1=Media |first1=Kompas Cyber }}</ref><ref name="pesankubah.com">[https://www.pesankubah.com/2023/05/arti-masakan-rendang-minangkabau.html Pesankubah.com: Menyelisik Arti Masakan Rendang Minangkabau Dalam Maknanya]</ref><ref name="Filosofi">{{Cite web|url=https://kumparan.com/sejarah-dan-sosial/filosofi-rendang-yang-mengandung-arti-kehidupan-mendalam-20GFQGiQAUH/full|title=Filosofi Rendang yang Mengandung Arti Kehidupan Mendalam|website=kumparan.com}}</ref>

Rendang is rich in spices. Along with the main [[beef|meat]] ingredient, rendang uses [[coconut milk]] and a paste of mixed ground spices, including [[ginger]], [[galangal]], [[turmeric]] leaves, [[lemongrass]], garlic, [[shallot]]s, [[Chili pepper|chilli]]s and other spices.

=== Cooking process - ''merendang'' ===
Azizah Ja'afar describes the cooking process of ''rendang'' (merendang) as involves simmering the meat in spiced coconut milk in an uncovered pot or pan until the coconut milk's oil separates and coats the meat, giving it a rich, glossy finish.<ref name="Rendang Istilah Rumah Tangga"/> With a slow fire and constant stirring, it takes around three hours for five kilograms of meat to reduce from a broth (when all the ingredients come together in a wok). From there, it requires an additional two hours before reaching the traditional rendang consistency.<ref name="Rendang Singapura Stories"/>

Among older generations of Singapore Malays, rendang wasn't limited to just the classic meat version either. Variations included cattle liver rendang, pigeon rendang, eel rendang, shellfish rendang, jackfruit rendang (prized for its fibrous, meat-like texture), and banana blossom rendang. Some recipes even incorporated petite potatoes to add a carbohydrate element to balance the dish's rich protein and fat content. For extra depth of flavor, a few tablespoons of ''[[kerisik]]'' (toasted, grated coconut) could be mixed in. ''Rendang hijau'' (green rendang), once a prized dish among the Riau-Singapore nobility, can still be found in the homes of some descendants, though it is becoming increasingly rare.<ref name="Rendang Singapura Stories">{{Cite web|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/webarchives/2021-05-14%2010:26:45.000/wp/details/http:%2F%2Fsingapurastories.com%2F2015%2F07%2Fslow-food-before-it-became-slow-food-the-story-of-rendang-by-khir-johari%2F|title='Slow food before it became Slow Food – THE STORY OF RENDANG' by Khir Johari|website=eresources.nlb.gov.sg}}</ref>

===  Types of ''rendang'' in West Sumatra ===
[[File:Nasi ramas rendang.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1|''Nasi ramas'' served with rendang, and other side dishes.]]

Today, rendang is widely enjoyed beyond ceremonial settings and has become a popular souvenir in Padang. While traditionally made with buffalo meat or beef, rendang now features a variety of ingredients. These include chicken, which cooks faster and is more economical; duck, common in areas like Payakumbuh; goat meat, often enjoyed in Agam; and seafood options like shellfish and salted fish. Other creative versions include ''randang talua'', made with tapioca flour and eggs, and shredded beef or chicken rendang, which resembles meat floss but with thicker fibers.<ref name="Rendang nan Enak itu"/>{{rp|33–43}}

In Minangkabau, ''randang'' is broadly categorized into two styles based on regional influences: ''randang darek'' and ''randang pasisia''. These variations reflect the geographical and cultural diversity of the highland (darek) and coastal (pasisia) areas of West Sumatra. Each variation of Rendang highlights the versatility of its signature spices, adapting to the availability of ingredients across different regions.<ref name="West Sumatra’s Rendang"/>

''Randang darek'' focuses on long cooking times, smaller pieces, and a smoky flavor, while ''randang pasisia'' highlights spice richness, tenderness, and suitability as a daily dish. Both offer unique qualities that reflect their regional culinary traditions.

Rendang is made from beef (or occasionally [[beef liver]], [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[Duck (food)|duck]], [[mutton]], [[domestic buffalo|water buffalo]], or vegetables like [[jackfruit]] or [[cassava]]). Chicken or duck rendang also contains [[tamarind]] and is usually not cooked for as long as beef rendang.<ref>{{cite book |title=Indonesian Regional Food and Cookery |last=Owen |first=Sri |publisher=Frances Lincoln Ltd |year=1999 |isbn=0-7112-1273-2}}</ref>

The [[Padang cuisine|original Minangkabau rendang]] has two categories, ''rendang darek'' and ''rendang pesisir''. ''Rendang darek'' (‘land rendang’) is an umbrella term for dishes from old regions in mountainous areas of the [[Minangkabau Highlands]] such as [[Batusangkar]], [[Agam Regency|Agam]], [[Limapuluh Koto Regency|Lima Puluh Kota]], [[Payakumbuh]], [[Padang Panjang]] and [[Bukittinggi]]. It mainly consists of beef, offal, poultry products, jackfruit, and many other vegetables and animal products that are found in these places. ''Rendang pesisir'' ('coastal rendang') is from the coastal regions of Minangkabau such as [[Pariaman]], [[Padang]], [[Painan]] and [[Pasaman]]. It mainly consists of seafood, although it is not unusual for it to include beef or water buffalo meat.

==== Rendang outside West Sumatra ====
Today, rendang is quite widespread in Indonesia, mainly because of the proliferation of [[Padang]] restaurants, which caused rendang to become popular in Indonesian households of various ethnic backgrounds. This has led to the development of variants to accommodate regional preferences. For example, in [[Java]], the rendang—aside from the Padang variety sold in Padang restaurants—tends to be wetter, slightly sweeter, and less spicy to accommodate [[Javanese people|Javanese]] tastes.

Rendang variations outside by the Minangkabau:

==== In the Netherlands ====
The Dutch are familiar with rendang through colonial ties and often serve the wet ''kalio'' version in the [[Netherlands]]—usually as part of a ''[[rijsttafel]]''.
