'''''Judd mat Gaardebounen''''' is a savory dish of smoked [[pork]] collar and [[broad bean]]s which is one of the most widely recognized national dishes of [[Luxembourg]]. It is associated with the village of [[Gostingen, Luxembourg|Gostingen]] in the south-east of the country where the inhabitants have earned the nickname of ''Bounepatscherten'' ("bean-madmen") as a result of their well-known [[broad bean]]s.<ref>[http://www.luxembourg.co.uk/recipes.html#Smoked Collar "Recipes from Luxembourg"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209135630/http://www.luxembourg.co.uk/recipes.html |date=2006-02-09 }}, ''Luxembourg Tourist Office, London''.

==Etymology==
The origin of the word "judd" is not clear. One possibility, suggested by the linguist Jean-Claude Muller, a member of Luxembourg's [[Grand Ducal Institute|Institut grand-ducal]], is that it comes from the Spanish word for bean (''judía''). He explains that in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], there is also a pork dish served with broad beans which is locally called ''judia'' pronounced "shu-DI-a". Muller theorizes that the dish was brought to Luxembourg by [[Spanish Netherlands|Spanish troops]] during the 16th or 17th century. If that indeed is the case, then "Judd mat Gaardebounen" approximates to "Beans with Beans".<ref>[http://www.fspl.clubs.lu/X-Phil-Lux-Divers/X-Thema-LU-Judd-mat-Gaardebounen-M2006-1.htm Jean-Claude MUuller, "'Judd mat Gaardebounen' le plat national luxembourgeois - un mets assaisonné d'antisémitisme?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305003646/http://www.fspl.clubs.lu/X-Phil-Lux-Divers/X-Thema-LU-Judd-mat-Gaardebounen-M2006-1.htm |date=2016-03-05 }}, initially published in the ''Bulletin trimestriel de l'Institut Archéologique du Luxembourg à Arlon''. {{in lang|fr}} Retrieved 3 December 2011.</ref> It has also been argued that the term derives from the [[Jew]] (''judío'') because "the dark color of the beans reminded some of the dark skin of the Spanish Jews".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Artsy |first1=Avishay |title='Jew With Beans' Is This European Country's National Dish |url=https://www.jta.org/jewniverse/2017/jew-with-beans-is-this-european-countrys-national-dish |agency=Jewish Telegraphic Agency |date=2 June 2017}}</ref>
