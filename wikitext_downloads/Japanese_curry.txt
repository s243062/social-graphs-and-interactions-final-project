'''Japanese curry''' ({{lang|ja|カレー}}, {{Transliteration|ja|karē}}) is commonly served in three main forms: {{nihongo|curry rice|カレーライス|karē raisu}} ([[curry]] over [[white rice]]), {{nihongo|curry [[udon]]|カレーうどん|karē udon}} (curry over thick noodles), and {{nihongo|[[curry bread]]|カレーパン|karē pan}} (a curry-filled pastry). It is one of the most popular [[Japanese cuisine|dishes in Japan]].<ref name="curry rice research">{{cite web |script-title=ja:『カレーライス』に関するアンケート |publisher = ネットリサーチ ディムスドライブ |url = http://www.dims.ne.jp/timelyresearch/2008/081014/ |language= ja |access-date=1 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211023222609/http://www.dims.ne.jp/timelyresearch/2008/081014/ |archive-date=23 October 2021}}</ref> The very common curry rice dish is most often referred to simply as {{nihongo|''curry''|カレー|karē}}.

Along with the sauce, a wide variety of vegetables and meats are used to make Japanese curry. The basic vegetables are onions, carrots, and potatoes. Beef, pork, and chicken are the most popular meat choices. [[Katsu curry]] is a [[Tonkatsu|breaded deep-fried cutlet]] (''tonkatsu''; usually pork or chicken) with Japanese curry sauce.<ref name="bbc_goodfood">{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/chicken_katsu_curry_48890 | title=Chicken katsu curry | publisher=BBC | work=Food recipes | date=2016 | access-date=20 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210714131951/https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/chicken_katsu_curry_48890 |archive-date=14 July 2021}}</ref>

Curry originates in [[Indian cuisine]] and was introduced to Japan by the British. Since the introduction of curry, it was reinvented to suit Japanese tastes and ingredients. Japanese curry has little resemblance to curries from other regions. The dish has changed and been adapted so much since its introduction that it stands on its own as uniquely Japanese. The combination of sweet, sticky [[Japanese rice|Japanese short-grain rice]] with a thickened curry sauce has led to the unique evolution of Japanese curry. The dish became popular and available for purchase at supermarkets and restaurants in the late 1960s. It is so widely consumed that it can be called a [[national dish]].<ref name="times-curry"/><ref name="curry rice research"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mitsubishielectric.co.jp/club-me/knowledge/washoku04/12.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240220131429/https://www.mitsubishielectric.co.jp/club-me/knowledge/washoku04/12.html|script-title=ja:カレーライスを国民食にした日本のごはん篇|language=ja|publisher=[[Mitsubishi Electric]]|date=|archive-date=20 February 2024|access-date=20 February 2024}}</ref>

==History==
=== Early Japanese curry ===
[[File:First-Curry-Rice-Recipe-of-Japan-Seiyo-Ryoritsu-by-Kanagaki-Robun-1872.jpg|thumb|First known curry rice recipe of Japan, by [[Kanagaki Robun]], 1872]]

Curry was introduced to Japan during the [[Meiji era]] (1868–1912). At the time, the [[Indian subcontinent]] was under [[British Raj|British colonial rule]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} It is most likely that the British introduced the spice mix called curry powder to Japan<ref name="times-curry">{{Cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2011/08/26/food/curry-its-more-japanese-than-you-think/ |title=Curry — it's more 'Japanese' than you think|last=Itoh|first=Makiko|date=26 August 2011 |work=The Japan Times |access-date=31 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180108233344/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2011/08/26/food/curry-its-more-japanese-than-you-think/|archive-date=8 January 2018}}</ref> via the countries' respective navies.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2014-07-29 |title=Kare Raisu |url=https://www.likejapan.com.au/column/did-you-know/kare-raisu.html |access-date=2025-01-08 |website=Like JAPAN! 記事 |language=ja}}</ref> It was classified as {{lang|ja-Latn|[[yōshoku]]}} (Western style food) since it came from the West.<ref name="times-curry"/> The word ''curry'' was probably adopted into the [[Japanese language]] as {{Transliteration|ja|karē}} in the late 1860s, when Japan was forced to abandon its [[sakoku|isolation ({{lang|ja-Latn|cat=no|sakoku}})]] and came into contact with the [[British Empire]].<ref name=":0">{{cite web |url=http://housefoods.jp/data/curryhouse/know/column/column06.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924123141/http://housefoods.jp/data/curryhouse/know/column/column06.html|trans-title= Ricecurry and Curryrice |script-title=ja:ライスカレーとカレーライス |publisher=House Foods |access-date=14 February 2015 |archive-date=24 September 2009|language=ja}}</ref> By the 1870s, curry began to be served in Japan.<ref name=Salt2016>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/04/08/473376519/from-india-to-north-korea-via-japan-currys-global-journey |title=From India To North Korea, Via Japan: Curry's Global Journey |last=Bell |first=Markus |date=8 April 2016 |website=The Salt |publisher=National Public Radio |access-date=15 November 2018 }}</ref>

Curry is commonly eaten as a [[rice dish]] in Japan, {{Transliteration|ja|karē raisu}} (curry rice). The oldest Japanese mention of a dish called {{Transliteration|ja|raisu karē}} (literally 'rice curry')—but as the misspelt {{Transliteration|ja|taisu karē}}—is in cookbooks from 1872.<ref name="times-curry"/> It was also described in an 1872 report, according to which [[Foreign government advisors in Meiji Japan|foreign experts]] ate this at the Tokyo branch of the [[Hokkaidō]] prefectural government. However, the word was popularized by American professor [[William S. Clark]] who was employed at the [[Sapporo Agricultural College]] (now [[Hokkaido University]]) in 1877.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hokudai.ac.jp/bureau/q/faq.html#9 |title=FAQ |script-title=ja:よくある質問と回答 |publisher=Hokkaidō University |access-date=14 February 2015 |language=ja |archive-date=24 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924031029/http://www.hokudai.ac.jp/bureau/q/faq.html#9 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hitsujigaoka.jp/en/second/#menu02 |title=Sapporo Hitsujigaoka Observation Hill |script-work=ja:さっぽろ羊ヶ丘展望台オフィシャルサイト |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214212325/http://www.hitsujigaoka.jp/en/second/#menu02 |archive-date=14 February 2015 |access-date=14 February 2015 |language=ja}}</ref> For 1873, there was a dish called curry rice on the menu of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] Military Academy.<ref name="house"/>

During the Meiji era (1868–1912), curry was still perceived in the private sector as a luxury cuisine for the wealthy, available only in high-end {{lang|ja-Latn|[[yōshoku]]}} specialty restaurants.<ref name="times-curry"/><ref name="OnoSalat2013">{{cite book|author1=Tadashi Ono|author2=Harris Salat|title=Japanese Soul Cooking: Ramen, Tonkatsu, Tempura, and More from the Streets and Kitchens of Tokyo and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WfaMDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA44|year=2013|publisher=Ten Speed Press|isbn=978-1-60774-352-1|page=44}}</ref> Since its introduction it was reinvented with ingredients from [[Japanese cuisine]] to make it suitable for Japanese tastes.<ref name="times-curry"/>

=== The beginning of the popularization of curry and the emergence of derivative foods ===
[[File:Marugame Seimen Curry udon.jpg|thumb|Curry [[udon]] and {{lang|ja-Latn|[[sushi|inari-zushi]]}}]]
In 1905, the dish became affordable for the general population with the introduction of domestically produced [[curry powder]].<ref name="house">{{cite web|url=https://housefoods.jp/data/curryhouse/know/trends01.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231026113713/https://housefoods.jp/data/curryhouse/know/trends01.html|script-title=ja:日本のカレー カレーが国民食になるまでの歩み|language=ja|publisher=[[House Foods]]|date=|archive-date=26 October 2023|access-date=20 February 2024}}</ref> In the 1920s, the predecessors of today's well-known [[S&B Foods]] and [[House Foods]] began selling powdered curry powder.<ref name="times-curry"/>

In the early 1900s, restaurants created various derivatives of curry rice. The first curry [[udon]] and curry [[soba]] were made in Tokyo or Osaka in 1904 or 1909. Curry udon and curry soba are made by soaking {{lang|ja-Latn|[[katsuobushi]]}} (dried [[bonito]] flakes) in boiling water to dissolve the [[umami]] components, adding curry to the broth, and then adding [[potato starch]] to thicken the broth and pour it over the udon or soba.<ref name="Kosuge">Keiko Kosuge (2017). {{lang|ja-Latn|Nipoon yōshoku monogatari taizen}} ({{lang|ja|にっぽん洋食物語大全}}), pp. 168–169.

=== Popularization as home cooking ===
In 1945, Oriental Co Ltd developed a powdered instant curry [[roux]],<ref name="oriental">{{cite web|url=https://www.tokai-tv.com/tokainews/feature/article_20220918_21815|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220918080149/https://www.tokai-tv.com/tokainews/feature/article_20220918_21815|script-title=ja:日本のカレー カレーが国民食になるまでの歩み|language=ja|publisher=[[Tōkai Television Broadcasting]]|date=18 September 2022|archive-date=18 September 2022|access-date=20 February 2024}}</ref> and in 1950, Bell Shokuhin Co Ltd developed a block-shaped instant curry roux, and Japanese curry quickly spread throughout Japan as a dish that could be easily prepared at home.<ref name="bell">{{cite web|url=https://www.bellsyokuhin.co.jp/company/#page1.5|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231205015723/https://www.bellsyokuhin.co.jp/company/#page1.5|script-title=ja:ベル食品工業株式会社|language=ja|publisher=Bell Shokuhin Co,.Ltd|date=|archive-date=5 December 2023|access-date=20 February 2024}}</ref><ref name="house"/> In 1948, Japanese curry was used in [[school meal]]s for the first time.<ref name="house"/>

In 1963, [[House Foods]] introduced "Vermont Curry" ({{lang|ja|バーモントカレー}}), an instant curry roux made with apples and honey, which exploded in popularity. This product brought a mild sweetness to Japanese curry, which had been perceived as a spicy, adult dish, and made Japanese curry one of children's favorite dishes.<ref name="house"/><ref name="times-curry"/>

In 1968 (or 1969<ref name="times-curry"/>), Otsuka Foods Company became the first company in the world to commercialize a [[retort pouch]] food product. The product was a Japanese curry called "Bon Curry" ({{lang|ja|ボンカレー}}).

Today, curry is one of the most popular daily dishes in Japan. In 2013, production totaled 7,570 tons of curry powder and 91,105 tons of ready-made sauces; sales in 2008 amounted to 7 billion yen for curry powder and 86 billion yen for ready-made sauces.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.curry.or.jp/reference/production.html |script-title=ja:生産量 |publisher=All Japan Curry Manufacturers Association |date=2013 |access-date=14 February 2015 |language=ja}}</ref> By 2000, curry was a more frequent meal than [[sushi]] or [[tempura]].<ref name=Vice2018>{{cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/a-brief-history-of-how-curry-ended-up-in-japan/ |title=A Brief History of How Curry Ended Up in Japan |last=Makalintal |first=Bettina |date=2 November 2018 |website=Munchies |publisher=Vice |access-date=15 November 2018 }}</ref> 

Curry similar to that served in the Indian subcontinent is known as ''{{lang|ja-Latn|italic=unset|Nakamura-ya}} curry''. It was introduced to Japan by [[Rash Behari Bose]] (1886–1945) when he began to sell curry at {{ill|Nakamura-ya|ja|中村屋}}, a bakery in Tokyo.<ref>{{cite news |last=Karmakar |first=Kaylan |date=25 September 2018 |title=Japanese Curry Is Nothing Like Indian Curry.

In Japanese homes, curry sauce is most commonly made from instant curry roux, which is available in block and powder forms. These contain curry powder, flour, oils, and various flavorings. Ease of preparation, variety, and availability of instant curry mixes made curry rice very popular, as it is very easy to make compared to many other [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese dishes]]. Pre-made curry is available in [[retort pouch]]es that can be reheated in boiling water. For those who make curry roux from scratch, there are also curry powders specially formulated to create the "Japanese curry" taste.<ref>{{cite news |last=Itoh |first=Makiko |date=26 August 2011 |title=Curry — it's more 'Japanese' than you think |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2011/08/26/food/curry-its-more-japanese-than-you-think/#.XGTQl1VKhhE |work=The Japan Times |location=Tokyo |access-date=13 February 2019 }}</ref>

Retort pouch curry sauce, prepared by heating the [[retort pouch]] in hot water or the microwave, is also popular.

==Serving==
Japanese curry rice is served in anything from a flat plate to a soup bowl. The curry is poured over rice in any manner and amount. [[Japanese rice|Japanese short-grain rice]], which is sticky and round, is preferred, rather than the medium-grain variety used in [[Cuisine of India|Indian]] dishes. It is usually eaten with a spoon, as opposed to [[chopsticks]], because of the liquid nature of the curry. Curry rice is usually served with [[fukujinzuke]] or [[Allium chinense|rakkyō]] on the side.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jan Davison|title=Pickles: A Global History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x15tDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT33|date=15 May 2018|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1-78023-959-0|page=33}}</ref>

Navy curry ({{lang|ja|海軍カレー}}, {{Transliteration|ja|kaigun karē}}) refers to the curry served by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) and the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] (JMSDF). Also called ''Yokosuka Kaigun (Navy) Curry''.<ref name="kikkoman/32-3">{{cite web |title=Yokosuka Kaigun Curry |url=https://www.kikkoman.com/en/culture/foodforum/tasty-travel/32-3.html |website=Kikkoman Corporation |access-date=18 July 2024 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="stripes/10857768">{{cite news |last1=Agee |first1=Kelly |title=Japanese sailors share their 'secret' curry recipes with US Navy chefs in Yokosuka |url=https://www.stripes.com/theaters/asia_pacific/2023-07-26/japanese-navy-curry-yokosuka-10857768.html |access-date=18 July 2024 |work=Stars and Stripes |date=July 26, 2023 |language=en}}</ref> The IJN used curry to prevent the malnutrition condition [[beriberi]], and in the present day the JMSDF's Friday menu is curry.<ref>[https://www.mod.go.jp/msdf/formal/family/recipe/archive/currey.html Curry Recipe] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190127110050/https://www.mod.go.jp/msdf/formal/family/recipe/archive/currey.html |date=27 January 2019 }} Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force {{in lang|ja}}</ref> It is also nutritious, and easy to cook in mass quantities.<ref name="jmod">{{cite web |publisher=Japan Ministry of Defense |website=Twitter |url=https://twitter.com/ModJapan_en/status/1430455062321516546 |title=Japan Ministry of Defense/Self-Defense Forces|date=25 August 2021 |archive-date=25 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210825113328/https://twitter.com/ModJapan_en/status/1430455062321516546 |access-date=19 October 2021}}</ref>

It is hypothesized that curry became popular in Japan because the IJN, modeled after the [[British Royal Navy]], adopted it as a menu item for its ship's mess,<ref name="Takahashi"/> or because it was on the menu of the Imperial Japanese Army's mess hall.<ref name=Vice2018/> On the other hand, Naoshi Takamori, a naval culinary researcher and former JMSDF officer, points out that although Japanese military manuals from the 1880s include instructions for making curry, curry did not become common in the Imperial Japanese Navy until the 1920s, during the [[Showa era]]. According to him, curry did not spread from the Japanese military to the Japanese civilian sector, but was adopted by the Japanese military from the civilian sector.<ref name="Takahashi">Naoshi Takamori (2018).

A 'navy curry' of [[beef]] or chicken meat, [[potatoes]], [[onions]], [[carrots]], [[rice]] and curry [[roux]] and a chutney of pickled vegetables ([[tsukemono]]) is described in the 1888 cookbook {{Nihongo3|'Navy Cooking Methods'|海軍割烹術|Kaigun kappōjitsu}}.

==Outside Japan==
===South Korea===
Curry was introduced to [[South Korea]] during [[Korea under Japanese rule|the period of Japanese rule]], and is popular there. It is often found at ''[[bunsik]]'' restaurants (diner-style establishments), [[tonkatsu|donkkaseu]]-oriented restaurants, and at the majority of Japanese restaurants. Premade curry and powdered mixes are also readily available at supermarkets.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

=== North Korea ===
Japanese curry was introduced to North Korea by [[Zainichi Koreans]] who migrated from Japan during the [[Koreans in Japan#Repatriation_to_Korea|1960s–1970s repatriation project]].<ref name="npr20160408">{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/04/08/473376519/from-india-to-north-korea-via-japan-currys-global-journey |first= Markus |last= Bell |date=8 April 2016|title=From India To North Korea, Via Japan: Curry's Global Journey|work = The Salt|publisher =NPR | access-date=12 May 2016}}</ref> Along with other Japanese cuisine, it was traded by new arrivals for local products and used to bribe [[Workers' Party of Korea|Workers' Party]] cadres.<ref name="npr20160408"/>

Due to the rapid rise in popularity of [[katsu curry]] in the United Kingdom, other varieties of Japanese curry and curry sauce are sometimes erroneously referred to as "katsu curry" and "katsu sauce", even in cases where the ''katsu'' (cutlet) itself is not included.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://soranews24.com/2020/02/12/the-u-k-thinks-japanese-curry-is-katsu-curry-and-people-arent-happy-about-it/|date=12 February 2020|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20210517025549/https://soranews24.com/2020/02/12/the-u-k-thinks-japanese-curry-is-katsu-curry-and-people-arent-happy-about-it/|archivedate=17 May 2021|title=The U.K. thinks Japanese curry is katsu curry, and people aren't happy about it}}</ref>
