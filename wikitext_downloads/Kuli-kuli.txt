== Ghanaian kuli-kuli ==
Kuli-kuli is a common crispy snack in [[Ghana]] and many other parts of West Africa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.196flavors.com/ghana-kuli-kuli/|title=Ghana: Kuli-Kuli|date=2019-06-26|website=196 flavors|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref> The ingredients and shapes used are not universal. In the northern part of the country, especially among the [[Kingdom of Dagbon|Dagbon]] people, kuli-kuli is made from the residue from groundnuts during the extraction of groundnut oil.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/2506230-kuli-kuligroundnut-cake|title=Kuli kuli(groundnut cookie) Recipe by Sunday Ali|last=Ali|first=Sunday|website=Cookpad|language=en|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref> It is mostly found in the [[Zongo settlements|Zongo]] communities in Ghana.<ref name=":0" />

== Preparation ==
To make kuli-kuli, peanuts are roasted and then ground into a paste called labu. The paste is then mixed with [[spice]]s, [[salt]], and sometimes ground [[Black pepper|pepper]], and occasionally sugar. The paste is stripped of excess oil with water and made into the desired shape (round balls, cylinders, etc.). Adding [[potash]] to the oil increases the boiling point of the oil.  This results in oils being extracted from the kuli-kuli so that more liquid oil is created than when the process started. While being heated and [[frying|fried]], the shaped peanut-paste begins to solidify and harden.  It is then removed from the oil and allowed to cool down until ready to be eaten. It has a very long shelf life and is often given to children as a treat or sold in taxi parks to travellers.

All aspects of producing and selling the peanut oil and kuli-kuli are socially considered 'woman's work'.  Quite often, women control all aspects of kuli-kuli production and sales. Women grow the crop, extract and refine the oil, cook the kuli-kuli, carry it to the market, and sell it.  In many cultural groups, this is considered 'her (personal) money' generated to spend as she deems fit. In contrast, a man growing peanuts is more likely to sell his entire crop of 100 kilo bags wholesale.  The wholesaler will be responsible for transportation.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Nigerian Food TV - Nigerian Food blog, Nigerian Food TV Channel, Nigerian Cuisine, Nigerian Food Recipes TV, African Food Blog|url=https://www.nigerianfoodtv.com/|website=Nigerian Food TV|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>
