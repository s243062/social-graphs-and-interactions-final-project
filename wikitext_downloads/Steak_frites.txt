'''''Steak frites''''',{{efn|"''Steak-frites''" is also known by a variety of other names in Flemish and French, such as "''Bifteck-frites''"; all with roughly the same meaning in translation.}} meaning "steak [and] chipped potatoes" in French, is a dish consisting of [[beefsteak]] accompanied by fried chipped potatoes. It is commonly served in Belgian and French [[brasserie]]s, and is considered by some to be the [[national dish]] of Belgium, which claims to be the country of origin.<ref name=SW158>{{cite book|last1=Schehr|first1=Lawrence R.|last2=Weiss|first2=Allen S.|title=French Food: On the Table On the Page and in French Culture|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon|year=2001|page=158|isbn=0415936284}}</ref>

Historically, [[rump steak]] was commonly used for this dish. Today, more commonly, the steak is an [[entrecôte]] also called rib eye, or scotch fillet (in Australia), [[Doneness|pan-fried rare]] ("''saignant''"—literally "bloody"), in a pan reduction sauce, sometimes with [[Hollandaise sauce|hollandaise]] or [[Bearnaise sauce|béarnaise]] sauce, served with deep-fried potatoes.<ref name=Bourdain>{{cite book|last=Bourdain|first=Anthony|title=Anthony Bourdain's Les Halles cookbook: strategies, recipes, and techniques of Classic Bistro Cooking|year=2004|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-58234-180-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SvxBdbOQ9Q8C&q=steak+frites&pg=PA20|author2=Jose de Meirelles |author3= Philippe Lajaunie|accessdate=3 January 2012|pages=120 & 137}}</ref><ref name=Beeton>{{cite book|last=Beeton|first=Isabella Mary|title=The Book of Household Management|year=1888|publisher=Ward, Lock & Company|location=London & New York|url=https://archive.org/details/bookhouseholdma01goog|quote=steak frites.|accessdate=3 January 2012|page=[https://archive.org/details/bookhouseholdma01goog/page/n851 770]}}</ref>
