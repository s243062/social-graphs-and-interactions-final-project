'''Ackee and saltfish''' is the Jamaican [[national dish]] prepared with [[ackee|sautéed ackee]] and [[Dried and salted cod|salted codfish]].

==Background==
The [[ackee]] fruit (''[[Blighia sapida]]'') is the national fruit of [[Jamaica]].<ref>{{cite web |title=National Fruit – Ackee – Office of the Prime Minister |url=https://opm.gov.jm/symbols/national-fruit-ackee/ |access-date=23 March 2024}}</ref> It was brought to the Caribbean from [[Ghana]] before 1725 as 'Ackee' or 'Aki', another name for the Akan people, [[Akyem]]. The fruit's scientific name honours [[William Bligh|Captain William Bligh]] who took the fruit from Jamaica to the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, England in 1793 and introduced it to science.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nlj.gov.jm/FeastingontheHeritage/ackee.htm |title=ACKEE |access-date=2013-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424224704/http://www.nlj.gov.jm/FeastingontheHeritage/ackee.htm |archive-date=2012-04-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Because parts of the fruit are toxic, such as the [[Aril|arils]] prior to the opening of the husk at the ripening stage, there are shipping restrictions when being imported to countries such as the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_64.html|title = Import Alert 21-11}}</ref> Salted codfish, on the other hand, was introduced to Jamaica for enslaved people as a long-lasting and inexpensive protein source.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-history-of-jamaica-tastes-like-ackee-and-saltfish/|newspaper=Vice|title=The History of Jamaica Tastes Like Ackee and Saltfish|first=Korsha|last=Wilson|date=21 June 2017}}</ref> In west Africa, ackee is mainly used as medicine or an ingredient for soap and is not consumed as food.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sainsbury |first=Brendan |title=Ackee and saltfish: Jamaica's breakfast of champions |url=https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20210315-ackee-and-saltfish-jamaicas-breakfast-of-champions |access-date=2023-06-02 |website=www.bbc.com |language=en}}</ref>
