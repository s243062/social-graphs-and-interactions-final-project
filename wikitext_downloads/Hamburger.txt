A '''hamburger''', often known as a '''burger''', consists of fillings—usually a [[patty]] of ground meat, typically [[beef]]—placed inside a sliced [[bun]], sesame seed bun, or [[bread roll]]. The patties are often served with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chilis. The filling of the burger can be topped with [[condiment]]s such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, [[relish]] or a "special sauce", often a variation of [[Thousand Island dressing]]. A burger with the patty topped with cheese is called a [[cheeseburger]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://therec.io/the-history-of-the-burger/|title=The history of the burger|access-date=October 15, 2019|archive-date=October 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191015123905/https://therec.io/the-history-of-the-burger/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Under some definitions, a hamburger is considered a [[sandwich]].

Hamburgers are typically associated with [[fast-food restaurant]]s and [[diner]]s but are also sold at other restaurants, including high-end establishments. There are many international and regional [[List of hamburgers|variations]] of hamburgers. Some of the largest multinational fast-food chains feature burgers as one of their core products: [[McDonald's]] [[Big Mac]] and [[Burger King]]'s [[Whopper]] have become global icons of [[American culture]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rella |first=Emily |date=2021-12-03 |title=Burger King Is Selling Iconic Menu Item for Less Than a Dollar |url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/burger-king-is-selling-iconic-menu-item-for-less-than-a/400690 |access-date=2023-08-03 |website=Entrepreneur |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-07-30 |title=Big Mac is 50, but McDonald's sticks with aging icon - CBS News |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/big-mac-is-50-but-mcdonalds-sticks-with-burger/ |access-date=2023-08-03 |website=www.cbsnews.com |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Etymology and terminology==
The term ''hamburger'' originally derives from [[Hamburg]], Germany. However, it's contentious what the exact connection between the food item and the city is.<ref>{{OEtymD|hamburger|access-date=October 17, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Barksdale|first=Nate|date=29 August 2014|title=Where Hamburgers Began—and How They Became an Iconic American Food|website=History.com|url=https://www.history.com/news/hamburger-helpers-the-history-of-americas-favorite-sandwich}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Avey|first=Tory|date=24 April 2024|title=Do You Actually Know Where Hamburgers Originated?|website=Parade.com|url=https://parade.com/61481/toriavey/where-did-hamburgers-originate/}}</ref>

By linguistic [[rebracketing]], the term "burger" eventually became a self-standing word that is associated with many different types of sandwiches that are similar to a hamburger, but contain different meats such as [[American bison|buffalo]] in the [[buffalo burger]], [[venison]], [[Kangaroo meat|kangaroo]], [[Chicken_sandwich#Chicken_Breast_Sandwich|chicken]],<ref name="Chicken Burger">{{cite journal |last1=Mikhail |first1=W.Z.A. |last2=Sobhy |first2=H.M. |last3=Khallaf |first3=M.F. |last4=Ali |first4=Hala M.Z. |last5=El-askalany |first5=Samia A. |last6=Ezz El-Din |first6=Manal M. |title=Suggested treatments for processing high nutritive value chicken burger |journal=Annals of Agricultural Sciences |date=June 2014 |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=41–45 |doi=10.1016/j.aoas.2014.06.006 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last7=Babiker |last6=Mohamed Ahmed |last5=Islam Sarker |last4=Gahfoor |last3=Alsawmahi |last2=Adiamo |last1=Al-Juhaimi |title=Effect of pistachio seed hull extracts on quality attributes of chicken burger |journal=CyTA - Journal of Food |date=2 January 2017 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=9–14 |doi=10.1080/19476337.2016.1193057 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=İncesu |first1=Melek |last2=Akköse |first2=Ahmet |title=Effect of different chloride salts on chicken burger quality |journal=International Food Research Journal |date=30 April 2024 |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=331–340 |id={{ProQuest|3069278947}} |doi=10.47836/ifrj.31.2.05 }}</ref> [[turkey as food|turkey]], [[elk]], [[lamb and mutton|lamb]] or [[fish]] such as [[salmon]] in the [[salmon burger]], and even with meatless sandwiches as is the case of the [[veggie burger]].<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/burger Burger] ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary''</ref>
The term ''burger'' can also be applied to a meat patty on its own. Since the term ''hamburger'' usually implies beef, for clarity ''burger'' may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat substitute used, as in '''beef burger''', [[Turkey as food|turkey]] burger, [[bison]] burger, or [[Portobello mushroom|portobello]] burger.

==History==
{{main|History of the hamburger|History of the hamburger in the United States}}
[[File:Hamburg steak.jpg|thumb|[[Hamburg steak]] has been known as "[[Frikadelle]]" in Germany since the 17th century.]]

There is a reference to a "[[Hamburg steak]]" as early as 1884 in ''[[The Boston Journal]]''.<sup>[OED, under "steak"]</sup> On July 5, 1896, the ''Chicago Daily Tribune'' made a highly specific claim regarding a "hamburger sandwich" in an article about a "Sandwich Car": "A distinguished favorite, only five cents, is Hamburger steak sandwich, the meat for which is kept ready in small patties and 'cooked while you wait' on the gasoline range."<ref name="hamburger1896">{{cite news

=== Claims of invention ===
"Hamburger steak sandwiches" have been advertised in U.S. newspapers from New York to Hawaii since at least the 1890s, but the inventor is unclear.<ref name="Washington Post">{{Cite news |title=Who invented the hamburger?

Hamburgers gained national recognition in the U.S. at the [[1904 St. Louis World's Fair]] when the ''New York Tribune'' referred to the hamburger as "the innovation of a food vendor on the pike."<ref name="Origin2" /> No conclusive argument has ended the dispute over invention. An article from [[ABC News (United States)|ABC News]] sums up: "One problem is that there is little written history. Another issue is that the burger spread happened largely at the World's Fair, from tiny vendors that came and went instantly. And it is entirely possible that more than one person came up with the idea at the same time in different parts of the country."<ref>{{cite web |author1=Berman, John  |author2=Millhon, Drew | url=https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=2856336 | title=A Major Beef!

====Louis Lassen====
The restaurant [[Louis' Lunch]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], founded in 1895, has long claimed to be the "birthplace of the hamburger sandwich".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sandwich Shop in New Haven, CT {{!}} Louis’ Lunch |url=https://louislunch.com/menu/ |access-date=2025-11-09 |website=Louis' Lunch |language=en-US}}</ref> Ostensibly, around 1900, Danish immigrant Louis Lassen found himself out of steaks when a customer ordered a quick hot meal.

====Charlie Nagreen====
One of the earliest claims of hamburger invention comes from [[Charlie Nagreen]], who in 1885 sold a meatball between two slices of bread at the Seymour Fair<ref name=Harmon /> now sometimes called the Outagamie County Fair.<ref name=Beach>Randall Beach (February 3, 2008) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130116040055/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-25510511.html Louis' Lunch has beef with book claiming it didn't invent the hamburger]. ''New Haven Register'' (New Haven, CT). McClatchy-Tribune Information Services.</ref> The Seymour Community Historical Society of [[Seymour (city), Outagamie County, Wisconsin|Seymour, Wisconsin]], credits Nagreen, also referred to as "Hamburger Charlie", with the invention. Nagreen was 15 when he reportedly sold pork sandwiches at the 1885 Seymour Fair so customers could eat while walking. The Historical Society explains that Nagreen named the hamburger after the Hamburg steak with which local German immigrants were familiar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seymourhistory.org/news/?id=35 |title="Hamburger" Charlie Nagreen |publisher=SeymourHistory.org |access-date=September 3, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Myron|last=Heuer |title=The real home of the hamburger |url=http://www.herald-journal.com/archives/1998/columns/mh101298.html |work=Herald & Journal |date=October 12, 1999 |access-date=March 24, 2008 }}</ref><!-- For proof, the Historical Society's website refers to articles posted on http://www.homeofthehamburger.org/history.html, but these establish only that Seymour's first annual fair took place in 1885 Nagreen claimed in 1947 to have invented the hamburger there. -->

====Otto Krause====
According to [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]], Otto Krause was the inventor of the hamburger. In 1891, he created a beef patty cooked in butter and topped with a fried egg. German sailors later omitted the fried egg.<ref name=Origin2 />

====Oscar Weber Bilby====
The family of Oscar Weber Bilby claims the first-known hamburger on a bun was served on July 4, 1891, on Grandpa Oscar's farm. The bun was a yeast bun.<ref>{{cite book|first=Josh|last=Ozersky |title=The Hamburger: A History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MjP0Jf2DGkEC&pg=PT19 |year=2009 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-15125-1 |page=19}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=John T.

====Frank and Charles Menches====
[[File:NYC-Diner-Bacon-Cheeseburger.jpg|thumb|right|A bacon cheeseburger from a New York City diner]]
Frank and Charles Menches claim to have sold a ground beef sandwich at the Erie County Fair in 1885 in [[Hamburg, New York]].<ref name=Beach /> During the fair, they ran out of pork sausage for their sandwiches and substituted beef.<ref name=Harmon /> The brothers exhausted their supply of sausage, so they purchased chopped-up beef from a butcher, Andrew Klein. Historian Joseph Streamer wrote that the meat was from Stein's market, not Klein's, despite Stein's having sold the market in 1874.<ref name=Harmon /> The story notes that, in this case, the name of the hamburger comes from Hamburg, New York, not Hamburg, Germany.<ref name=Harmon /> Frank Menches's obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'' states that these events took place at the 1892 Summit County Fair in [[Akron, Ohio]].<ref>"Obituary: Charles Menches." The New York Times. October 5, 1951.</ref>

====Fletcher Davis====
Fletcher Davis of [[Athens, Texas]], claimed to have invented the hamburger. According to oral histories, he opened a lunch counter in Athens in the 1880s and served a 'burger' of fried ground beef patties with mustard and Bermuda onion between two slices of bread, with a pickle on the side.<ref name="Origin2"/> The story is that in 1904, Davis and his wife Ciddy ran a sandwich stand at the St. Louis World's Fair.<ref name="Origin2"/> Historian Frank X.

====Other hamburger-steak claims====
Various claims of the invention relate to the term "hamburger steak" without mention of its being a sandwich. The alleged first printed American menu listing hamburgers is an 1834 menu from [[Delmonico's]] in New York.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Louis E. |last1=Grivetti |first2=Jan L. |last2=Corlett |first3=Bertram M. |last3=Gordon |first4=Cassius T. |last4=Lockett |date=January–February 2004 |title=Food in American History, Part 6-Beef (Part 1): Reconstruction and Growth Into the 20th Century (1865–1910) |journal=Nutrition Today |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=18–25 |pmid=15076706 |doi=10.1097/00017285-200401000-00006|issn=0029-666X}}</ref> However, the printer of the original menu was not yet in business in 1834.<ref name="amhistory">{{cite web|url=http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/HamburgerHistory.htm|title=What's cooking America: History of the Hamburger|first=Matthew|last=Preusch|date=October 26, 2007 }}</ref> In 1889, a menu from Walla Walla Union in Washington offered hamburger steak as a menu item.<ref name="Origin2"/>

Between 1871 and 1884, "Hamburg Beefsteak" was on the "Breakfast and Supper Menu" of the Clipper Restaurant at 311/313 Pacific Street in [[San Fernando, California]]. It cost 10 cents—the same price as mutton chops, pig's feet in batter, and stewed veal. It was not, however, on the dinner menu. Only "Pig's Head", "Calf Tongue", and "Stewed Kidneys" were listed.<ref>Roger M. Grace (January 15, 2004).

* 1921: [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]], [[Wichita, Kansas]]. Due to [[The Jungle|books by Upton Sinclair]] and Arthur Kallet discrediting the cleanliness and nutritional value of ground beef, hamburger meat was unpopular with families until the White Castle restaurant chain took it upon themselves to market the cleanliness and quality of their food through scientific studies by preparing the food in full view of customers. The Company also reported in local newspapers how they carefully selected their meat, and opened the "Food Experiment Department" as a test kitchen and quality-control laboratory.<ref name="SBS"/> White Castle marketed and sold large numbers of small {{convert|2+1/2|in|mm|order=flip|round=5|abbr=on}} square hamburger sandwiches, known as [[slider (sandwich)|sliders]], and created five holes in each patty, which helped them cook evenly and eliminated the need to flip the burger.

==In the United States==
[[File:Flickr XP-ert 489502412--Cheeseburgers on grill.jpg|thumb|Hamburger preparation in a fast food establishment]] [[File:Fat "L" Half Pound Burger at home.jpg|thumb|A hamburger with fries bought as take-away, with the hamburger and the fries in separate containers]]
Hamburgers are often a feature of [[fast food]] [[restaurant]]s. In the United States, the hamburger patties served by major fast food chains are usually mass-produced in factories and then frozen for delivery to the site.<ref>For references, see the literature review in William O. Giles "Method for preparing hamburger patties" {{US Patent|5484625}} issued January 16, 1996.</ref> These hamburgers are relatively thin, differing from the traditional American hamburger prepared in homes and conventional restaurants, which is thicker and prepared by hand from [[ground beef]]. Most American hamburgers are round, but some fast-food chains, such as [[Wendy's]], [[Krystal (restaurant)|Krystal]], and [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]] sell square-cut hamburgers. Hamburgers in fast food restaurants are usually grilled on a flat top, but some establishments, such as [[Burger King]], use a gas flame grilling process. At conventional American restaurants, hamburgers may be ordered "rare" but normally are served medium-well or well-done for food safety reasons. Fast food restaurants do not usually offer this option.

The McDonald's fast-food chain sells the [[Big Mac]], one of the world's top-selling hamburgers, with an estimated 550 million sold annually in the United States.<ref>[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/big-mac-hits-the-big-4-0/ Big Mac Hits The Big 4-0], [[CBS News]], February 11, 2009.</ref> Many other major fast-food chains, also rely heavily on hamburger sales, including [[Burger King]] (known as [[Hungry Jack's]] in Australia), [[A&W Restaurants|A&W]], [[Culver's]], [[Whataburger]], [[Carl's Jr.]]/[[Hardee's]] chain, [[Wendy's]], [[Jack in the Box]], [[Krystal (restaurant)|Krystal]], [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]], [[Cook Out (restaurant)|Cook Out]], [[Harvey's]], [[Hesburger]], [[Supermac's]], [[Shake Shack]], [[In-N-Out Burger]], [[Five Guys]], [[Fatburger]], Vera's, [[Burgerville]], [[Back Yard Burgers]], [[Lick's Homeburger]], [[Roy Rogers Restaurants|Roy Rogers]], [[Smashburger (restaurant chain)|Smashburger]], and [[Sonic Drive-In|Sonic]]. [[Fuddruckers]] and [[Red Robin]] are hamburger chains that specialize in the mid-tier "restaurant-style" variety of hamburgers.

Some restaurants offer elaborate hamburgers using expensive cuts of meat and various cheeses, toppings, and sauces. One example is the [[Bobby's Burger Palace]] chain founded by celebrity chef and [[Food Network]] star [[Bobby Flay]].

Hamburgers are often served as a fast dinner, picnic, or party food and are often cooked outdoors on barbecue grills.

A high-quality hamburger patty is made entirely of ground (minced) beef and seasonings. These may be described as "all-beef hamburger" or "all-beef patties" to distinguish them from inexpensive hamburgers made with cost-savers like added [[flour]], [[textured vegetable protein]], [[Pink Slime|ammonia treated defatted beef trimmings]],<ref name="Anatomy of a Burger">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/10/04/us/20090917-meat.html |work=The New York Times |title=Anatomy of a Burger |date=October 4, 2009 |access-date=May 4, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Moss">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/04/health/04meat.html |work=The New York Times |title=The Burger That Shattered Her Life |first=Michael|last=Moss |date=October 3, 2009 |access-date=May 4, 2010}}</ref> [[advanced meat recovery]], or other [[meat extender|fillers]]. In the 1930s, ground [[liver (food)|liver]] was sometimes added. Some cooks prepare their patties with binders like [[Egg (food)|eggs]] or [[breadcrumb]]s. Seasonings may include salt and pepper, [[parsley]], onions, [[soy sauce]], [[Thousand Island dressing]], [[French onion soup|onion soup]] mix, or [[Worcestershire sauce]]. Many name-brand [[seasoned salt]] products are also used.

=== Cost ===
According to [[Bloomberg News]], the average price of a fast-food restaurant burger in the United States increased by 16% between 2019 and 2024, reaching $8.41 in the second quarter of 2024. Specifically, the iconic Big Mac at McDonald's cost $5.29 during the same period, representing a 21% price increase over the same five-year span.<ref>{{cite web | last=Shanker | first=Deena | title=The End of the Cheap Burger | website=Bloomberg.com | date=2024-09-26 | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-26/mcdonald-s-faces-the-end-of-the-cheap-burger-era-as-prices-rise-sales-drop | access-date=2024-09-29}}</ref>

The cost of Big Mac hamburgers in different countries has been used by [[The Economist]] to easily compare purchasing power of different currencies in the [[Big Mac Index]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Our Big Mac index shows how burger prices differ across borders |url=https://www.economist.com/interactive/big-mac-index |website=The Economist |publisher=The Economist |access-date=14 November 2025}}</ref>

===Safety===
Raw hamburgers may contain harmful bacteria that can produce food-borne illnesses such as [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|''Escherichia coli'' O157:H7]], due to the occasional initial improper preparation of the meat, so caution is required for safety during handling and cooking. Because of the potential for food-borne illness, the [[USDA]], recommends hamburgers be cooked to an internal temperature of {{convert|160|F}}.<ref name=USDA>{{cite web |url=https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/meat/ground-beef-and-food-safety |title=Ground Beef and Food Safety|access-date=July 26, 2016}}</ref> If cooked to this temperature, they are considered [[well-done]].<ref>[http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OA/news/1998/colorpr.htm USDA Urges Consumers To Use Food Thermometer When Cooking Ground Beef Patties] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903093259/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OA/news/1998/colorpr.htm |date=September 3, 2009 }}.

The latter are often prepared with a variety of toppings, including [[lettuce]], [[tomato]], [[onion]], and often sliced [[Pickled cucumber|pickles]] (or pickle relish). [[French fries]] (or commonly [[poutine]] in Canada) often accompany the burger. [[Cheese]] (usually [[processed cheese|processed cheese slices]] but often [[Cheddar cheese|Cheddar]], [[Swiss cheese (North America)|Swiss]], [[pepper jack]], or [[blue cheese|blue]]), may be either melted directly on the meat patty or crumbled on top.{{Citation needed|date=November 2025}}

[[Condiment]]s might be added to a hamburger or may be offered separately on the side, including [[ketchup]], [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]], [[mayonnaise]], [[relish]], salad dressings and [[barbecue sauce]].

A [[patty melt]] consists of a patty, [[sautéed]] onions and cheese between two slices of [[rye bread]]. The sandwich is then buttered and fried.

A [[slider (sandwich)|slider]] is a tiny square hamburger patty served on an equally small bun and usually sprinkled with diced onions. According to the earliest citations, the name originated aboard [[U.S. Navy]] ships due to how greasy burgers slid across the galley grill as the ship sailed.<ref>[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/slider_or_slyder_mini_hamburger/ Slider or Slyder (mini-hamburger)].

* In [[Minnesota]], a "[[Jucy Lucy|Juicy Lucy]]" (also spelled "Jucy Lucy"), is a hamburger with cheese inside the meat patty rather than on top. A piece of cheese is surrounded by raw meat and cooked until it melts, resulting in a molten core within the patty.

The toppings include [[avocado]], [[jalapeño]] slices, shredded [[lettuce]], [[onion]], and [[tomato]]. The bun has [[mayonnaise]], [[ketchup]], and [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]]. [[Bacon]] may also be added, which can be fried or grilled along with the meat patty. A slice of [[pineapple]] may be added to a hamburger for a "Hawaiian hamburger".{{Citation needed|date=November 2025}}

Some restaurants' burgers also have barbecue sauce, and others replace the ground patty with sirloin, [[Al pastor]] meat, [[barbacoa]], or fried chicken breast. Many burger chains from the [[United States]] can be found in [[Mexico]], including [[Carl's Jr.]], [[Sonic Drive-In|Sonic]], [[McDonald's]], and [[Burger King]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2025}}

===United Kingdom and Ireland===
Hamburgers in the UK and Ireland are very similar to those in the US, and the same big two chains dominate there as in the U.S.&nbsp;— McDonald's and Burger King. The menus offered to both countries are virtually identical, although portion sizes tend to be smaller in the UK. In Ireland, the burger-serving food outlet [[Supermacs]] is widespread throughout the country. In Ireland, [[Abrakebabra]], which began as a kebab restaurant, and [[Eddie Rocket's]] are also major chains.{{Citation needed|date=November 2025}}

A native rival to the big two U.S. chains was the fast-food chain popular in Britain, [[Wimpy (brand)|Wimpy]], originally known as Wimpy Bar (opened 1954 at the Lyon's Corner House in Coventry Street London), which served its hamburgers on a plate with British-style [[french fries|chips]], accompanied by [[cutlery]] and delivered to the customer's table. In the late 1970s, to compete with McDonald's,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wimpy.uk.com/moments.htm |title=Wimpy History |work=wimpy.uk.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509122138/http://www.wimpy.uk.com/moments.htm |archive-date=May 9, 2008 }}</ref> Wimpy began to open American-style counter-service restaurants, and the brand disappeared from many UK high streets when those restaurants were re-branded as Burger Kings between 1989 and 1990 by the then-owner of both brands, [[Grand Metropolitan]]. A [[management buyout]] in 1990 split the brands again, and now Wimpy table-service restaurants can still be found in many town centers, while new counter-service Wimpys are now often found at highway service stations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2025}}

Hamburgers are also available from mobile [[kiosk]]s, commonly known as "burger vans", particularly at outdoor events such as [[football (soccer)|soccer]] games. These burgers are usually served without any form of salad, only fried onions and a choice of tomato ketchup, mustard, or brown sauce.{{Citation needed|date=November 2025}}

Hamburgers and [[veggie burger]]s served with chips, and salad are standard [[pub grub]] menu items. Many pubs specialize in "gourmet" burgers. These are usually high-quality minced steak patties topped with things such as blue cheese, brie, avocado, or anchovy mayonnaise.. Some British [[pub]]s serve burger patties made from more exotic meats, including [[venison]] burgers (sometimes nicknamed Bambi Burgers), [[bison]] burgers, [[ostrich]] burgers, and in some Australian-themed pubs even [[Kangaroo meat|kangaroo]] burgers can be purchased. These burgers are served similarly to the traditional hamburger but are sometimes served with a different sauce, including redcurrant sauce, mint sauce, or plum sauce.{{Citation needed|date=November 2025}}

In the early 21st century, "premium" hamburger chains and independent restaurants have arisen, selling burgers produced from meat stated to be of high quality and often [[Organic food|organic]], usually served to eat on the premises rather than to take to-go.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/food/Story/0,,1676523,00.html|title=Camembert with that, sir? | location=London | first=Josh| last=Lacey | date=January 2, 2006 | access-date=May 4, 2010}}</ref> Chains include [[Gourmet Burger Kitchen]], Ultimate Burger, Hamburger Union, and Byron Hamburgers in London.

In the UK, as in North America and [[Japan]], the term "burger" can refer simply to the patty, be it beef, some other kind of meat, or vegetarian.{{Citation needed|date=November 2025}}

===Australia and New Zealand===
[[File:Hamburger in New Zealand.jpg|thumb|right|This hamburger in a fast food restaurant in [[Auckland]], New Zealand, contains [[beetroot]] for flavor.]]
Fast food franchises sell American-style fast-food hamburgers in Australia and New Zealand. The traditional [[Australasia]]n hamburgers are usually bought from [[fish and chip shop]]s or milk bars rather than from chain restaurants. These traditional hamburgers are becoming less common as older-style fast food outlets decrease in number. The hamburger meat is almost always ground beef, or "mince", as it is more commonly referred to in Australia and New Zealand. They often include tomato, lettuce, grilled onion, and meat, at least. This is known in Australia as a "plain hamburger", and may also include cheese, pineapple, a fried egg, [[beetroot]], and bacon. If all these optional ingredients are included, it is known in Australia as a "burger with the lot".<ref>{{cite news

In Australia and New Zealand, as in the United Kingdom, the word ''sandwich'' is generally reserved for two ''slices'' of bread (from a loaf) with fillings in between them. This is unlike in American English where a ''sandwich'' is fillings between two pieces of any kind of bread, not only slices of bread. As such, in Australia and New Zealand, ''burgers'' are not generally considered to be ''sandwiches''.<ref name="Unilever">{{Cite web|title=Recipes for tasty, crunchy & saucy American style sandwiches|url=https://www.unileverfoodsolutions.com.au/chef-inspiration/trends-on-plate/americana/pick-it-up-and-shove-it-in.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220209073308/https://www.unileverfoodsolutions.com.au/chef-inspiration/trends-on-plate/americana/pick-it-up-and-shove-it-in.html|archive-date=2022-02-09|access-date=2022-02-09|website=Unilever Food Solutions|language=en-AU|quote=Expect a blank look if you're in the States and ask for a chicken burger 'cause they ain't got a clue what the hell you're talking about...

The only variance between the two countries' hamburgers is that New Zealand's equivalent to "The Lot" often contains a steak (beef). The condiments regularly used are barbecue sauce and [[Tomato sauce#Australia, New Zealand and South Africa|tomato sauce]]. The traditional Australasian hamburger never includes mayonnaise. The [[McDonald's]] "McOz" Burger is partway between American and Australian style burgers, having beetroot and tomato in an otherwise typical American burger; however, it is no longer a part of the menu. Likewise, McDonald's in New Zealand created a [[Kiwiburger]], similar to a Quarter Pounder, but including salad, beetroot, and a fried egg. The [[Hungry Jack's]] ([[Burger King]]) "Aussie Burger" has tomato, lettuce, onion, cheese, bacon, beetroot, egg, ketchup, and a meat patty, while adding pineapple is an upcharge. It is essentially a "Burger with the lot" but uses the standard Hungery Jack's circular breakfast egg rather than the fully fried egg used by local fish shops.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hungryjacks.com.au/menu |title=Hungry Jack's menu |access-date=March 10, 2012}}</ref>

===China===
[[File:Roujiamo, La Taverne de Zhao, Paris 17 September 2016.jpg|thumb|right|{{transliteration|zh|[[Roujiamo]]}}, the "Chinese hamburger"]]
In China, due to the branding of their sandwiches by [[McDonald's]] and [[KFC]] restaurants in China, the word "burger" ({{lang|zh|汉堡}}) refers to all sandwiches that consist of two pieces of bun and a meat patty in between.<ref name="Sohu-2017">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sohu.com/a/161318777_224814|title=汉堡和三明治有什么区别?强力科普这些外来词!|date=August 1, 2017|website=Sohu}}</ref>

A popular Chinese [[street food]], known as {{transliteration|zh|[[roujiamo]]}} ({{lang|zh|肉夹馍}}), consists of meat (most commonly pork) sandwiched between two buns. {{transliteration|zh|Roujiamo}} has been called the "Chinese hamburger".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-hamburgers-rou-jia-mo/|title=Chinese Hamburger, Rou Jia Mo 肉夹馍|date=March 4, 2017|website=The Woks of Life|language=en-US|access-date=January 5, 2020}}</ref> Since the sandwich dates back to the [[Qin dynasty]] (221–206 BC) and fits the aforementioned Chinese word for burger, Chinese media have claimed that the hamburger was invented in China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eater.com/2015/4/14/8414083/china-claims-it-invented-hamburger-burger|title=China Brazenly Claims it Invented the Hamburger|last=Shah|first=Khushbu|date=April 14, 2015|website=Eater|language=en|access-date=January 5, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-are-chinese-hamburger_n_7020056|title=The World's First Hamburger Comes From Where?|date=April 8, 2015|website=HuffPost|access-date=January 5, 2020}}</ref><ref name="Sohu-2017" />

===Japan===
[[File:MOS Kaisen01.JPG|thumb|right|[[MOS Burger]] [[rice burger]]]]
In Japan, hamburgers can be served in a bun, called {{nihongo||ハンバーガー|hanbāgā}}, or without a bun, which is known as {{nihongo||ハンバーグ|hanbāgu}} or "hamburg", short for "hamburg steak".

''[[Hamburg steak]]s'' (served without buns) are similar to what are known as [[Salisbury steak]]s in the US. They are made from minced beef, pork, or a blend of the two mixed with minced onions, eggs, breadcrumbs, and spices. They are served with [[brown sauce]] (or [[demi-glace]] in restaurants) with vegetable or salad sides, or occasionally in [[Japanese curry|Japanese curries]]. Hamburgers may be served in casual, Western-style suburban restaurant chains known in Japan as "[[casual dining|family restaurants]]".{{Citation needed|date=November 2025}}

Hamburgers with buns are predominantly the domain of fast food chains. Japan has homegrown hamburger chain restaurants such as [[MOS Burger]], [[First Kitchen]], and [[Freshness Burger]]. Local varieties of burgers served in Japan include [[teriyaki]] burgers, {{transliteration|ja|katsu}} burgers (containing {{transliteration|ja|[[tonkatsu]]}}) and burgers containing shrimp {{transliteration|ja|[[korokke]]}}. Some of the more unusual examples include the [[rice burger]], where the bun is made of rice, and the luxury 1,000-yen (US$10) "Takumi Burger" (meaning "artisan taste"), featuring [[avocado]]s, freshly grated [[wasabi]], and other rare seasonal ingredients. In terms of the actual patty, there are burgers made with [[Kobe beef]], butchered from cows that are fed with beer and massaged daily. McDonald's Japan also recently in 2021<ref>{{cite web |title=The popular "McPork" has been revived with power-ups! "Bacon Mac Pork" at "affordable price" of 200 yen |url=https://entabe.com/23723/mcdonalds-bacon-mcdonalds-pork |website=entabe.com |access-date=8 September 2025}}</ref> launched a McPork burger made with US [[pork]]. McDonald's has been gradually losing market share in Japan to these local hamburger chains due partly to the preference of Japanese diners for fresh ingredients and more refined, "upscale" hamburger offerings.<ref>{{cite web | title=Ideaforesight: Upscale, modern fast food | url=http://ideaforesight.wordpress.com/2010/07/11/upscale-modern-fast-food/|work=ideaforesight's blog| date=July 11, 2010}}</ref>

=== Denmark ===
[[File:Danish Beef Sandwich.JPG|thumb|The modern Danish bøfsandwich]]
In Denmark, the hamburger was introduced in 1949, though it was called the [[bøfsandwich]]. There are many variations. While the original bøfsandwich was simply a generic meat patty containing a mix of beef and [[horse meat]], with slightly different garnish (mustard, ketchup, and soft onions), it has continued to evolve. Today, a bøfsandwich usually contains a beef patty; pickled cucumber; raw, pickled, fried, or soft onions; pickled red beets; mustard; ketchup; [[Remoulade#Danish remoulade|remoulade]]; and is often overflowing with brown gravy, which is sometimes even poured on top of the assembled bøfsandwich. The original bøfsandwich is still on the menu at the same restaurant from which it originated in 1949, now run by the original owner's grandson.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Danmarks første bøfsandwich fylder 70|url=https://www.mynewsdesk.com/dk/dyrehavsbakken/pressreleases/danmarks-foerste-boefsandwich-fylder-70-2862780|access-date=2021-03-10|website=Mynewsdesk|language=da|archive-date=July 26, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210726144557/https://www.mynewsdesk.com/dk/dyrehavsbakken/pressreleases/danmarks-foerste-boefsandwich-fylder-70-2862780|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Following the popularity of the bøfsandwich, many variations sprung up, using different types of meat instead of the beef patty. One variation, the [[flæskestegssandwich]], grew especially popular. This variation replaces the minced beef patty with slices of pork loin or belly and typically uses sweet-and-sour pickled red cabbage, mayonnaise, mustard, and pork rinds as garnish.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Flæskestegssandwich {{!}} Vores opskrift på den bedste flæskestegssandwich|url=https://meyers.dk/opskrifter/flaeskestegssandwich/p/71518/|access-date=2021-03-10|website=meyers.dk}}</ref>

Today, the bøfsandwich, flæskestegssandwich, and their many variations co-exist with the more typical hamburger, with the opening of the first Burger King restaurant in 1977 popularizing the United States dish in Denmark. Many local, high-end burger restaurants dot the major cities, including [[Popl (restaurant)|Popl]], an offshoot of [[Noma (restaurant)|Noma]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2025}}

===East Asia===
[[File:Bulgogi burger 2.jpg|thumb|left|Korean-style bulgogi burger]]

[[Rice burger]]s mentioned above are also available in several East Asian countries such as Taiwan and South Korea. [[Lotteria]] is a prominent hamburger franchise in Japan owned by the South Korean [[Lotte (conglomerate)|Lotte]] group, with outlets also in China, South Korea, Vietnam, and Taiwan. In addition to selling beef hamburgers, they have hamburgers made from squid, pork, tofu, and shrimp. Variations available in South Korea include [[Bulgogi]] burgers and [[Kimchi]] burgers.

In the Philippines, a wide range of major U.S. fast-food franchises are well represented, together with local imitators, often amended to the local palate. The chain [[McDonald's]] (locally nicknamed "McDo") has a range of burger and chicken dishes often accompanied by plain [[steamed rice]], or French fries. The Philippines boasts its own burger chain called [[Jollibee]], which offers burger meals and chicken, including a signature burger called "Champ". Jollibee now has several outlets in the United States, the [[SWANA]] region, and East Asia.{{Citation needed|date=November 2025}}

===India===
[[File:Vada pav, bombay, maharastra- DSC 0025.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vada pav]] or "Bombay Burger" is made of potatoes and spices.]]
In India, where there are cultural beliefs against eating beef (which stem from [[Hinduism|Hindu]] religious practice) and pork (which stems from [[Islamic]] religious practice), the term ''burger'' refers to a variety of sandwiches usually made from chicken or vegetable patties. Accordingly, most fast food chains and restaurants in India do not serve beef. McDonald's in India offers the "Maharaja Mac" instead of the Big Mac, substituting the beef patties with chicken.<ref>{{cite news |title=The World's Most Original Burgers: Chicken Maharaja Mac - BusinessWeek |url=http://images.businessweek.com/ss/09/07/0722_innovative_burgers/8.htm |access-date=25 November 2025 |work=Businessweek.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727095414/http://images.businessweek.com/ss/09/07/0722_innovative_burgers/8.htm |archive-date=27 July 2009 |language=en}}</ref>

The ''[[vada pav]]'', consisting of a deep-fried potato patty dipped in gram flour batter, is sometimes called the Bombay burger.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kazim |first1=Leyla |title=I ate three in a row: the Bombay burger, India’s favourite fast food – plus the recipe |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/mar/01/bombay-burger-vada-pav-india-mumbai-street-food-recipe |access-date=25 November 2025 |work=The Guardian |date=1 March 2021}}</ref>

===Pakistan===

In Pakistan, apart from in American fast food chains, burgers can be found in stalls near shopping areas. The best known is the "shami burger". This is made from "shami kebab", made by mixing lentils and minced lamb.<ref>[http://en.recidemia.com/wiki/Arouk Fried lamb burger recipe on Recidemia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114150802/http://en.recidemia.com/wiki/Arouk |date=January 14, 2013 }}.

===Turkey===

In Turkey, in addition to the internationally familiar offerings, numerous localized variants of the hamburger may be found, such as the Islak Burger ({{lit|Wet-Burger}}), which is a beef slider doused in seasoned tomato sauce and steamed inside a special glass chamber, and has its origins in the Turkish fast food retailer Kizilkayalar. Other variations include lamb burgers and [[offal]]-burgers, which are offered by local fast food businesses and global chains alike, such as McDonald's and [[Burger King]]. Almost all major fast food chains deliver.{{Citation needed|date=November 2025}}
