'''Pickled herring''' is a traditional way of preserving [[herring as food]] by [[pickling]] or [[Curing (food preservation)|curing]].

Most cured herring uses a two-step [[curing (food preservation)|curing]] process: it is first cured with salt to extract water; then the salt is removed and the herring is [[brining|brined]] in a [[vinegar]], salt, and sugar solution, often with [[peppercorn]], [[bay leaf|bay leaves]], raw onions, and so on. Additional flavourings include [[sherry]], [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]] and [[dill]], while other non-traditional ingredients have also begun being included in recent years.

Pickled herring remains a popular food or ingredient to dishes in many parts of Europe including Scandinavia, Great Britain, the Baltic, Eastern and Central Europe, as well as the Netherlands. It is also popular in parts of Canada such as [[British Columbia]], [[Newfoundland]], and the [[Maritimes]]. It is also associated with [[Ashkenazi Jew]]ish cuisine, becoming a staple at [[kiddush]]es and social gatherings. Pickled herring is one of the [[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|twelve dishes]] traditionally served at [[Christmas Eve]] in [[Russia]], [[Poland]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Ukraine]]. Pickled herring is also eaten at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve to symbolize a prosperous New Year in Poland, the Czech Republic, Germany, and parts of Scandinavia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/lucky-foods-for-the-new-year-77891531/ |title=Lucky Foods for the New Year |publisher=Smithsonian.com |access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>

==History==
Pickled herrings have been a staple in Northern Europe since medieval times, being a way to store and transport fish, especially necessary in meatless periods like [[Lent]]. The herrings would be prepared, then packed in barrels for storage or transportation. In 1801 Dutch fishermen amongst the prisoners of war in the [[Norman Cross Prison]] were sent to Scotland to teach the Scottish herring fishermen how to cure fish using the Dutch method.<ref>{{cite news|title= Extract of a letter|newspaper= Aberdeen Press and Journal|date= 4 August 1802|page= 3}}</ref>

In the [[Nordic countries]], once the pickling process is finished and depending on which of the dozens of herring flavourings (mustard, onion, garlic, [[Vaccinium vitis-idaea|lingonberries]] etc.) are selected, it is eaten with dark [[rye bread]], [[crisp bread]], [[sour cream]], or potatoes. This dish is common at Christmas, Easter, and Midsummer, where it is frequently accompanied by spirits like [[akvavit]].

[[Soused herring]] (''maatjesharing'' or just ''maatjes'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) is an especially mild salt herring, which is made from young, immature herrings. The herrings are ripened for a couple of days in oak barrels in a salty solution, or [[brine]]. In English, a "soused herring" can also be a cooked marinated herring.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/apr/10/nigel-slaters-classic-soused-mackerel-recipe|last=Slater|first=Nigel|title=Classic Soused mackerel|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=10 April 2011|date=2011-04-09}}</ref>

[[Rollmops]] are [[pickling|pickled]] herring [[Fillet (cut)|fillets]] rolled (hence the name) into a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] shape around a piece of pickled [[gherkin]] or an [[onion]]. They are thought to have developed as a special treat in 19th century Berlin,<ref>Erich Urban, Das Alphabet der Küche, Berlin 1929, Artikel ''Rollmops'', S. 201</ref> and the word borrowed from the [[German language|German]].

Fish cured through pickling or salting have long been consumed in the British Isles. Like [[jellied eel]], it was primarily eaten by, and is sometimes associated with, the working class. [[Kipper]] is a dish eaten in Great Britain, Ireland, and parts of Canada. It consists of a split open herring, pickled or salted, and cold-smoked.

Red herring is similar to kippers but is whole and ungutted; it is more heavily salted and is smoked for 2–3 weeks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fao.org/3/x5933e/x5933e01.htm|title = The Herring}}</ref> The main UK export markets are Europe and West Africa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.herripedia.com/red-and-black-herring/|title = Red Herring|date = 11 February 2019}}</ref>

Pickled herring, especially [[brine (food)|brined]] herring, is common in [[Russian cuisine|Russia]] and [[Ukrainian cuisine|Ukraine]], where it is served cut into pieces and seasoned with sunflower oil and onions, or can be part of herring salads, such as [[dressed herring]] ({{langx|ru|Сельдь под шубой}}, {{langx|uk|Оселедець під шубою}}, lit. 'herring under a fur coat'), which are usually prepared with vegetables and seasoned with mayonnaise dressing.

Brined herring is common in [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi Jewish]] cuisine, perhaps best known for [[vorschmack]] salad known in English simply as "chopped herring" and as [[schmaltz herring]] in Yiddish. In [[Israel]] it is commonly known as ''dag maluach'' which means "salted fish".

Pickled herring can also be found in the cuisine of [[Hokkaidō]] in Japan, where families traditionally preserved large quantities for winter.

In [[Nova Scotia]], Canada, pickled herring with onions is called "Solomon Gundy" (not to be confused with the Jamaican [[Solomon Gundy|pickled fish pâté]] of the same name).

"Bismarck herring" ([[German language|German]] ''Bismarckhering'') is the common name for pickled herring in Germany, and the product is sometimes sold elsewhere under that name. There are various theories as to why the product is associated with [[Otto Bismarck|Bismarck]].

== Nutritional content ==
Pickled herring is rich in [[tyramine]] and thus should be avoided in the diet of people being treated with an antidepressant [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Candace S.|last2=Bryant|first2=Stephen G.|date=March 1988|title=Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors: Safety and Efficacy Issues|journal=Drug Intelligence & Clinical Pharmacy|volume=22|issue=3|pages=232–235|doi=10.1177/106002808802200311|pmid=3284731|s2cid=10898067|issn=0012-6578}}</ref>

As with fresh herring, pickled herring is an excellent natural source of both [[vitamin D3]] and [[omega-3 fatty acids]].<ref>{{Cite journal |pmc = 99405|year = 2002|last1 = Holub|first1 = B.
