==History==

The exact origin of the dish is unclear, references to it are found in [[Music_of_Palestine#Pre-1948|Palestinian folk songs]] from the 19th-century.<ref name="kassis">{{cite web |last1=Kassis |first1=Reem |title=Msakhan (Palestinian Flatbreads With Onion, Sumac, and Roast Chicken) Recipe |url=https://www.seriouseats.com/msakhan-recipe-5219618 |website=Serious Eats |access-date=7 July 2025 |language=en |author1-link=Reem Kassis}}</ref>

Some sources state that the dish was created by mistake, where in communal ovens that were dug into the ground, ingredients like chicken and bread were frequently placed next to one another to cook simultaneously, and eventually came to be placed on top of one another.<ref name="TASTE" />

Different versions of the dish have existed for 150 years.<ref name="TASTE">{{cite web |last1=Yassky-Weiss |first1=Eyal |title=The Musakhan Queens of Ramallah |url=https://tastecooking.com/musakhan-queens-ramallah/ |website=TASTE |access-date=7 July 2025 |date=30 January 2018}}</ref>

==Preparation==
[[File:المسخن الفلسطيني على الطريقة الشمالية.jpg|thumb|''Musakhan rolls''|upright]]

Musakhan is simple to make and the ingredients needed are easily obtainable, which may account for the dish's popularity. Many of the ingredients used—[[olive oil]], sumac and pine nuts—are staples of Palestinian cuisine. The dish is typically eaten with one's hands. It is usually presented with the chicken on top of the bread, and could be served with soup.<ref name="tamimi">{{cite web |last1=Tamimi |first1=Sami |last2=Wrigley |first2=Tara |author1-link=Sami Tamimi |title=Chicken Musakhan |url=https://www.anotherpantry.co.uk/recipes/chicken-musakhan/ |website=Another Pantry |access-date=7 July 2025 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="kassis" />

Some contemporary versions will shape the dish into rolls rather than the traditional layered setup, with thin [[saj bread]] instead of the much thicker taboon bread,<ref>{{cite news |title='Every dish on our menu is a memory made real': Dubai-based food author crafts unique culinary experience |url=https://www.khaleejtimes.com/entertainment/every-dish-on-our-menu-is-a-memory-made-real-dubai-based-food-author-crafts-unique-culinary-exper |access-date=7 July 2025 |work=Khaleej Times |date=16 Jan 2024 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="kassis" /><ref name="aljazeera" /> other contemporary versions make it into a ''[[fatteh]]''.<ref name="WaPo">{{cite news |last1=Kassis |first1=Reem |author1-link=Reem Kassis |title=This Palestinian fatteh of bread, chicken and yogurt honors tradition |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2023/06/23/msakhan-fatteh-palestinian-peasant-food/ |access-date=9 September 2025 |work=The Washington Post |date=23 June 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=لاين |first1=الجمهورية أون |title=فتة المسخن من ألذ الاطباق على سفرة رمضان بالفيديو |url=https://www.gomhuriaonline.com/Gomhuria/616747.html |access-date=15 September 2025 |work=[[Al Gomhuria]] |date=3 May 2020 |language=Arabic |trans-title=Musakhan Fatteh is one of the most delicious dishes on the Ramadan table}}</ref>
