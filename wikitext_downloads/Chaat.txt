'''Chaat''', or '''chāt''' ([[IAST]]:  ''cāṭ)'' ({{lit|lick, tasting, delicacy}}) is a family of fried dough [[snack]]s that originated in [[India]], typically served as an [[hors d'oeuvre]] or at roadside tracks from stalls or [[food cart]]s across [[South Asia]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Sanjay |last=Thumma |author-link=Sanjay Thumma |publisher=Vahrehvah.com |location=[[Hyderabad, India]] |title=Chaat Recipes |url=http://www.vahrehvah.com/Chaat_Recipes.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103083129/http://www.vahrehvah.com/Chaat_Recipes.php |archive-date=3 November 2012 |access-date=27 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://infokosh.bangladesh.gov.bd/detail.php?article_id=195&content_type=0&doc_type=5 |title=The Chaat Business |website=infokosh.bangladesh.gov.bd |language=bn |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121129011150/http://infokosh.bangladesh.gov.bd/detail.php?article_id=195&content_type=0&doc_type=5 |archive-date=29 November 2012 |access-date=17 October 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> With its origins in [[Uttar Pradesh, India]],<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Best Recipes From Uttar Pradesh (Varanasi/ Agra / Mathura )|url=http://cooks.ndtv.com/article/show/10-best-recipes-from-uttar-pradesh-437213|work=NDTV|date=25 October 2013|access-date=26 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028034511/http://cooks.ndtv.com/article/show/10-best-recipes-from-uttar-pradesh-437213|archive-date=28 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> chaat has become popular in the rest of South Asia.

==Etymology==
[[File:Chaatmasala.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chaat masala]] is a distinct spice blend used specifically in chaat snacks.]]
The word derives from Hindi ''cāṭ'' चाट (tasting, a delicacy), from ''cāṭnā'' चाटना (to lick, as in licking one's fingers while eating), from [[Prakrit]] ''caṭṭei'' चट्टेइ (to devour with relish, eat noisily).<ref name=oxford>Oxford English Dictionary. ''Chaat''. Mar. 2005 Online edition.  Retrieved 18 February 2008.</ref>

==Overview==
{{unreferenced-section|date=August 2023}}
[[File:5-water Pani Puri.jpg|thumb|[[Panipuri]] is one of the popular chaats in South Asia.]]
[[File:Dahi vada or dahi bhalla.jpg|thumb|[[Dahi vada]] chaat with yogurt]]
All chaat variants are based on fried dough. The original chaat is a mixture of potato pieces, crisp fried bread, [[dahi vada]] or dahi bhalla, gram or [[Chickpea|chickpeas]] and tangy-salty spices, with sour Indian chili and [[Sooth (chutney)|saunth]] (dried ginger and tamarind sauce), fresh green coriander leaves and yogurt for garnish, but other popular variants included [[alu tikki]]s or [[samosa]] (garnished with onion, potatoes, coriander, peas, hot spices and a dash of yogurt), [[bhel puri]], [[dahi puri]], [[panipuri]], [[dahi vada]], [[papri chaat]], and [[sev puri]].

There are common elements among these variants including [[dahi (curd)|dahi]] (yogurt); chopped [[onions]] and [[coriander]]; [[sev (food)|sev]] (thin dried yellow salty noodles); and [[chaat masala]], typically consisting of [[amchoor]] (dried [[mango]] powder), [[cumin]], [[kala namak]] (Himalayan black rock salt), [[coriander]], dried [[ginger]], [[salt]], [[black pepper]], and [[Capsicum|red pepper]]. The ingredients are combined and served on a small metal plate or a [[banana leaf]], dried and formed into a bowl.

==History==
Some of the dishes now categorized as chaats, such as [[Dahi vada|Dahi Vada]], can be traced back to ancient periods. A recipe for a dahi vada analogue called ''kshiravata'' is mentioned in ''[[Manasollasa]]'', a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by [[Someshvara III]], who ruled from present-day [[Karnataka]].<ref>{{cite book|author=K.T. Achaya|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bk9RHRCqZOkC&pg=PA85|title=The Story of Our Food|publisher=Universities Press|year=2003|isbn=978-81-7371-293-7|page=85}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite news|last=Vishal|first=Anoothi|title=Chaat Masala: Gourmet Indian street food|work=The Economic Times|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/chaat-masala-gourmet-indian-street-food/articleshow/73615337.cms|access-date=4 September 2020}}</ref> According to food historian [[K. T. Achaya|K.T Achaya]], descriptions of dahi vada also appear in literature far earlier from 500&nbsp;BC.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Krishna|first=Priya|date=17 August 2020|title=Chaat Is More Than the Sum of Its Many Flavors|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/17/dining/chaat-recipes-maneet-chauhan.html|access-date=4 September 2020|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Another dish resembling as chaat as an organized phenomenon or distinct group of dishes, according to culinary anthropologist [[Kurush Dalal]], originated in northern India (now [[Uttar Pradesh]]) in the late 17th century during the reign of Mughal Emperor [[Shah Jahan]]. The royal doctors had asked the people of Delhi to consume spicy and fried snacks, as well as [[Curd (India)|dahi]], as a countermeasure to the alkaline water of the [[Yamuna river]] that coursed through the city.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Ramadurai|first=Charukesi|date=3 June 2020|title=Pani Puri: India's favourite street food... at home?|url=https://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200602-pani-puri-indias-favourite-street-food-at-home|access-date=25 August 2020|website=BBC Travel}}</ref>

Most chaats originated in some parts of [[Uttar Pradesh]] in India later in 20th century,<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Best Recipes From Uttar Pradesh (Varanasi/ Agra / Mathura )|url=http://cooks.ndtv.com/article/show/10-best-recipes-from-uttar-pradesh-437213|work=NDTV|date=25 October 2013|access-date=26 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028034511/http://cooks.ndtv.com/article/show/10-best-recipes-from-uttar-pradesh-437213|archive-date=28 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> but they are now eaten all across [[South Asia]] and neighboring countries. Some are results of cultural [[syncretism]].
