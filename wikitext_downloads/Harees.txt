Harees is a popular dish known throughout [[Armenia]] where it is served on [[Easter|Easter day]], and the [[Arab world]], where it is commonly eaten in [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]] in the month of [[Ramadan]], and in [[Iraq]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Bahrain]] during [[Ashura]] by [[Shia Muslims]].

==Etymology==
"Harisa", also transliterated as "horisa", derived from the Arabic verb "haras" meaning "to squish" to describe the action of breaking and pounding the grains before mixing it with water to create a porridge.<ref>Gil Marks, Encyclopedia of Jewish Foods, 656 (Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley & Sons, 2010), 258.</ref>

In Arabic, "Harees" ({{langx|ar|[[wikt:هريس|هريس]]}}) is linked to the verb ({{langx|ar|[[wikt:هَرَسَ|هَرَسَ]]|harasa}}) which still means to mash or to squash.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Team|first1=Almaany|title=Definition and meaning of Harees in Arabic - Arabic dictionary - Page 1|url=https://www.almaany.com/ar/dict/ar-ar/%D9%87%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B3/|website=www.almaany.com|language=en}}</ref>

==History==

Harisa is mentioned by Ibn al-Karim in ''Kitab Al-Tabikh'' as early as the seventh century.<ref>Ibn al-Karīm, Muḥammad ibn al-Ḥasan, and Charles Perry. ''A Baghdad Cookery Book : the Book of Dishes, 127 (Kitāb Al-Ṭabīkh)'', (Totnes, UK: Prospect, 2005), 72.</ref> In the anecdotal cookbook, the ''Umayyad Caliph, Mu'awiya,'' returns from a trip to Arabia after returning to his newly won Persian lands. In some versions of the story, Mu'awiya is met with some Yemenite Jews whom he asks to prepare the porridge he tasted abroad while in other versions, he approaches locals. This story should be taken with a grain of salt as the author penned the story three centuries after it supposedly occurred.

Harees is documented in [[Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq]]'s 10th-century cookbook ''Kitab Al Tabikh''.,<ref>Charles Perry, "Cooking with the Caliphs", ''Saudi Aramco World'' '''57''':4 (July/August 2006) [http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200604/cooking.with.the.caliphs.htm full text] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141130201629/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200604/cooking.with.the.caliphs.htm |date=2014-11-30 }}</ref> as well as in [[Muhammad_bin_Hasan_al-Baghdadi |al-Baghdadi]]'s 13th-century cookbook ''Kitab Al Tabikh'' and [[Ibn Razīn al-Tujībī]]'s  13th-century Andalusian cookbook ''Kitab Fadalat al-khiwan fi tayyibat al-ta'am w'al-alwan''.

Harees is also the origin of [[haleem]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scroll.in/magazine/925615/why-are-some-indian-muslims-renaming-ramzan-favourite-haleem-as-daleem|title=The haleem debate: Why some Indian Muslims are renaming the Ramzan delicacy 'daleem'|date=3 June 2019 }}</ref> and [[cholent]].<ref name=":0">Gil Marks, Encyclopedia of Jewish Foods, 656 (Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley & Sons, 2010), 40.</ref>

==Preparation==
The wheat is soaked overnight, then simmered in water along with meat and butter or sheep tail fat. Any remaining liquid is strained and the mixture is beaten and seasoned. Harees may be garnished with cinnamon, sugar, and clarified butter.

==Variants and traditions==
There is a different traditional way of preparing Harees in each of the Arab countries in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] area, and among the tribes of these countries. Some variations include the use of cardamom pods in [[Saudi Arabia]], or a garnish with parsley. Before the [[Armenian genocide]] where Armenians were spread through a larger area they also had different variations of Harisa. The wheat used in Armenian harissa is typically shelled (pelted) wheat, though in [[Adana]], harissa was made with կորկոտ (''korkot''; ground, par-boiled shelled wheat). Harissa can be made with lamb, beef, or chicken.<ref name="ahk1913">{{cite book |last1=Keoleian |first1=Ardashes Hagop |url=https://archive.org/details/orientalcookbook00keol |title=The Oriental Cook Book |date=1913 |publisher=Sully & Kleinteich}}</ref>

Harees was only made by the wealthy during Ramadan and [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]], for the duration of a three- to seven-day wedding. It was, however, customary for the Harees dishes to be shared with poorer neighbours on such occasions.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

It is similar to [[Keşkek|kashkeg]], a kind of homogeneous [[porridge]] made of previously stewed and boned [[Chicken as food|chicken]] or [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] and coarsely ground soaked [[wheat]] (typically shelled wheat).

===Arab cuisine===
[[File:Harees.JPG|thumb|Harees]]
Harees is a popular dish in [[Arab cuisine]], from the [[Levantine cuisine|Levant]] to the [[Arab cuisine of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf]]. It is often served during [[Ramadan]], festivals such as [[Eid ul-Fitr]], and at weddings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitabudhabi.ae/en/dining.in.abudhabi/cuisine.aspx |title=Welcome to Abu Dhabi - Emirati Cuisine |access-date=2010-11-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129114246/http://visitabudhabi.ae/en/dining.in.abudhabi/cuisine.aspx |archive-date=2010-11-29 }}</ref> In Lebanon, it is often cooked on religious occasions in a communal pot, such as in [[Ashura]].

===Armenian cuisine===

'''Harisa''' ({{Langx|hy|հարիսա|''harisa''}}) is traditionally served on [[Easter|Easter day]], and is considered a [[national dish]] of [[Armenia]].<ref name="FFF" /> It is a thick porridge made from ''korkot'' (dried or roasted cracked wheat) and fat-rich meat, usually chicken or lamb. Herbs were substituted for meat in ''harissa'' when Armenian religious days required fasting and penance. The extremely long cooking process is an essential part of the ''harisa'' tradition. Like other ritual dishes, the time taken for preparation is part of its cherished value.<ref name="FFF">{{cite book|title=Armenian food: fact, fiction & folklore|year=2006|publisher=Yerkir Pub.|location=Bloomington, Ind.|isbn=9781411698659|author=Irina Petrosian, David Underwood|edition=2.|page=65}}</ref>

Harisa is known for helping the Armenians of [[Musa Dagh|Musa Ler]] (in modern-day Turkey) to survive during the [[Musa Dagh Resistance|resistance of 1915]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Albala|first=Ken|title=Food cultures of the world encyclopedia|url=https://archive.org/details/foodculturesworl00alba|url-access=limited|year=2011|publisher=Greenwood|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=9780313376276|page=[https://archive.org/details/foodculturesworl00alba/page/n21 8]}}</ref>

===Egyptian cuisines===

In [[Egyptian cuisine]], "[[freekeh]]", unripened, crushed durum wheat, was used to cook [[harisa]], giving the resulting ''ferik'' a unique green hue.<ref>Joel Haber, “Ferik-Egyptian Hamin”, (Jerusalem, Israel: Aish.com, 2022); Elais and Gary, “Lamb Harissa & Gazelle’s Horns”, (Santa Fe, NM:Made In Marrow, 2019).</ref> The origin of the variation could be linked to the Sephardic migration of the 13th century, but historians remain uncertain.<ref name="Marks, 11">Marks, 11.</ref>

===Kashmiri cuisine===
[[File:Hareesa.JPG|thumb|Harisa]]
Harisa or Hareesa ([[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] : {{Lang|ks|{{uninastaliq|[[wikt:ۂرؠ سہٕ|ۂرؠ سہٕ]]}}}}  {{IPA|[hərʲsɨ]}}) in [[Kashmir Valley|Kashmir]] is prepared during winter ([[Chillai Kalan]]),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scroll.in/magazine/823623/harissa-the-traditional-winter-delicacy-that-warms-up-a-cold-kashmiri-morning|title=It's harissa time again: Savour the traditional winter delicacy that warms up cold Kashmiri mornings|first=Rayan|last=Naqash|website=Scroll.in|date=16 December 2016 }}</ref> typically made of mutton and rice flour and eaten with Kashmiri Bread called Girda ([[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] : {{Lang|ks|{{uninastaliq|گِردٕ}}}} {{IPA|[girdɨ]}} ). It is cooked in huge ''degs'' (earthen pots) placed in wood fired ovens. [[Downtown Srinagar]] is considered as the hub of harisa making in [[Kashmir]].
