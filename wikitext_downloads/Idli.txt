'''Idli''' ({{IPAc-en|'|ɪ|d|l|iː}}; plural: '''idlis''') is a [[South India|South Indian]] and [[Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan]] rice cake popular as a breakfast food. The cakes are made by steaming a batter consisting of [[Fermentation (food)|fermented]] hulled [[Vigna mungo|black lentils]] and rice. The fermentation process breaks down the starches so that they are more readily metabolised by the body.

Idli has several variations, including [[rava idli]], which is made from [[semolina]]. Regional variants include ''[[Sanna (dish)|sanna]]'' of [[Konkan]].

==History==
A precursor of the modern idli is mentioned in several ancient Indian works. ''[[Vaddaradhane]]'', a 920&nbsp;CE [[Kannada language]] work by [[Shivakotiacharya]], mentions "iddalige", prepared only from a [[Vigna mungo|black gram]] batter. Chavundaraya II, the author of the earliest available Kannada encyclopedia, ''Lokopakara'' ({{circa}}1025&nbsp;CE), describes the preparation of this food by soaking black gram in [[buttermilk]], ground to a fine paste, and mixed with the clear water of [[curd]] and spices.{{sfn|Edward R. Farnworth|2003|p=11}} The [[Western Chalukya]] king and scholar [[Someshwara III]], reigning in the area now called [[Karnataka]], included an idli recipe in his encyclopedia, ''[[Manasollasa]]'' (1130&nbsp;CE). This [[Sanskrit]]-language work describes the food as ''iḍḍarikā''. In Karnataka, the Idli in 1235&nbsp;CE is described as being "light, like coins of high value", which is not suggestive of a rice base.{{sfn|K. T. Achaya|1994|p=90}} The food prepared using this recipe is now called ''uddina idli'' in Karnataka.

The recipe mentioned in these ancient Indian works leaves out three key aspects of the modern idli recipe: the use of rice (not just black gram), the long fermentation of the mix, and the [[steaming]] for fluffiness. The references to the modern recipe appear in the Indian works only after 1250&nbsp;CE. Food historian [[K. T. Achaya]] speculates that the modern idli recipe might have originated in present-day [[Indonesia]], which has a long tradition of fermented food. According to him, the cooks employed by the [[Hindu]] kings of the [[Indianised kingdom]]s might have invented the steamed idli there, and brought the recipe back to India during 800–1200&nbsp;CE.<ref name="KTAchaya2003">{{cite book |author=K.T.

To make idli, four parts uncooked rice (idli rice or [[parboiled rice]]) to one part whole white lentil (black gram, ''[[Vigna mungo]]'') are soaked separately for at least four to six hours or overnight. Optionally, spices such as fenugreek seeds can be added at the time of soaking for additional flavour. Once soaked, the lentils are ground to a fine paste, the rice is separately coarsely ground, and they are combined. Next, the mixture is left to ferment overnight during which its volume will more than double. After fermentation, some of the batter may be kept as a starter culture for the next batch. The finished idli batter is put into a perforated greased idli tray for steaming. The perforated molds allow the idlis to be cooked evenly. The tree holds the trays above the level of boiling water in a pot, and the pot is covered until the idlis are done (about 10–25 minutes, depending on size). A more traditional method is to use leaves instead of moulds.<ref>{{cite web|title=Idlis in jackfruit leaves|url=http://www.aayisrecipes.com/breakfast-or-snacks/idlis-in-jackfruit-leaveshittukhottekhotte-kadubu/|website=Aayi's Recipes|access-date=14 October 2014|year=2006}}</ref>

===Serving===
Since plain idlis are mild in taste, a condiment is considered essential. Idlis are often served with [[chutney]]s (coconut-based), [[Sambar (dish)|sambar]] and [[medu vada]]. However, this varies greatly by region and personal taste. It is also often served with kaara chutney (onion-based) or [[Spicy Sri Lankan Fish Curry (Malu Mirisata)|spicy fish curries]]. The dry spice mixture [[Idli podi|podi]] is convenient while travelling. 
[[File:Idly Wada.jpg|right|thumb|Idli served with coconut chutney, sambar and [[medu vada]] on banana leaf.]]

===Variations===
There are several regional variations of idlis made in South India and Sri Lanka. With the emigration of south Indians and Sri Lankans throughout the region and world, many variations on idli have been created in addition to the almost countless local variations. Hard-to-get ingredients and differing cooking customs have required changes in both ingredients and methods. [[Parboiled rice]] can reduce the soaking time considerably. Store-bought ground rice or cream of rice may also be used.<ref>{{cite web|title=Idli using Cream of Rice|url=http://ediblyasian.info/recipes/idli-using-cream-of-rice|website=Edibly Asian|access-date=14 October 2014}}</ref> Similarly, [[semolina]] or [[cream of wheat]] may be used for preparing [[rava idli]] (wheat idli).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Geeta|first1=Seth|title=Rava Idli : (Cream of wheat or sooji idli)|url=http://www.northindiancooking.com/rava-idli-sooji-or-cream-of-wheat-idli.html|website=North India Cooking|access-date=14 October 2014}}</ref> [[Dahi (curd)|Dahi]] (yogurt) may be added to provide the sour flavour for unfermented batters.

In addition to or instead of fenugreek, other spices may be used such as mustard seeds, chili peppers, cumin, coriander, ginger, etc.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rachana|first1=Gorikapudi|title=Fenugreek Leaves Idli|url=http://spicycurriez.blogspot.com/2012/02/fenugreek-leaves-idli.html|website=SPICY CURRIES|access-date=14 October 2014|date=2012}}</ref> Sugar may be added to make them sweet instead of savoury.

Batter preparation using a manual rocking rock grinder can be replaced by electric grinders or blenders. Many restaurants have also come up with fusion recipes of idlis such as idly manchurian, idly fry, chilly idly, stuffed idly, to name a few.

==Batter fermentation==
Fermentation of idli batter results in both leavening caused by the generation of carbon dioxide as well as an increase in acidity. This fermentation is performed by lactic acid bacteria, especially the heterofermentative strain ''[[Leuconostoc mesenteroides]]'' and the homofermentative strain ''[[Enterococcus faecalis]]'' (formerly classified as ''Streptococcus faecalis''). Heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria such as ''L. mesenteroides'' generate both lactic acid as well as carbon dioxide whereas homofermentative lactic acid bacteria only generate lactic acid.

Both ''L. mesenteroides'' and ''E. faecalis'' are predominantly delivered to the batter by the black gram. Both strains start multiplying while the grains are soaking and continue to do so after grinding.

''L. mesenteroides'' tolerates high concentrations of salt unlike most other bacteria. Hence the salt in the batter and the ongoing generation of lactic acid both suppress the growth of other undesirable micro-organisms.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=VEEN|first1=A.
