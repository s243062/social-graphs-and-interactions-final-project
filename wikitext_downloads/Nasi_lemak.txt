==History and background==
Nasi lemak was mentioned as early as 1875 in a French–Malay dictionary compiled by Pierre-Étienne-Lazare Favre,<ref>Favre, P. É. L. (1875). [https://www.google.com.my/books/edition/Dictionnaire_malais_fran%C3%A7ais/3Ec0AQAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=n%C4%81si%20lemak&printsec=frontcover Dictionnaire malais-français]. Austria: Imprimerie impériale et royale – via Google Books</ref> a Roman Catholic missionary based on the Malay peninsula, and in a book titled ''The Circumstances of Malay Life'', written by [[Richard Olaf Winstedt]] in 1909.<ref>{{cite book |last=Winstedt |first=Richard Olaf |author-link=Richard Olaf Winstedt |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_2cQcAAAAMAAJ |title=The Circumstances of Malay Life |publisher=Ams Press Inc |year=1909 |access-date=23 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_2cQcAAAAMAAJ|title=The circumstances of Malay life Free Ebook|year=1981|isbn=9780404168827 |last1=Winstedt |first1=Richard |publisher=AMS Press }}</ref> With roots in Malay culture and [[Malay cuisine|cuisine]], the name of the dish in [[Malay language|Malay]] literally means "fat rice"<ref name="foodspotting">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PswWAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT52 |title=The Foodspotting Field Guide|editor= April V.

Traditionally, nasi lemak is wrapped and served in [[banana leaves]], together with a hot spicy sauce (''[[sambal]]'') and various garnishes, including fresh cucumber slices, fried [[Anchovy (food)|anchovies]] (''ikan bilis''), roasted peanuts, and hard-boiled or fried eggs.<ref name="foodspotting"/><ref name="malaymail">{{cite web |url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/eat-drink/article/nasi-lemak-the-one-dish-that-unites-us-all |title=Nasi lemak: The one dish that unites us all |author= Lee Khang Yi|work=Malay Mail Online |date=31 August 2014 }}</ref>

As a more substantial meal, nasi lemak may also be served with an additional protein dish such as ''[[ayam goreng]]'' (fried chicken), ''sambal sotong'' ([[cuttlefish]] in chili), small fried fish, [[Cockle (bivalve)|cockles]], and ''[[rendang]] daging'' (beef stewed in coconut milk and spices).<ref name="malaymail"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hungrygowhere.my/dining-guide/food-trends/nasi-lemak-wars-*aid-6b523101/ |title=Nasi Lemak Wars |author=Karen-Michaela Tan |date=14 October 2014 |work=Hungry Go Where |access-date=1 April 2015 |archive-date=28 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928151538/http://www.hungrygowhere.my/dining-guide/food-trends/nasi-lemak-wars-*aid-6b523101/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> Other accompaniments include stir-fried [[Ipomoea aquatica|water convolvulus]] (''kangkong'')<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dVyJAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA126 |title=Malay Heritage Cooking |author= Rita Zahara|page=126 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish International (Asia) Pte Ltd |date=1 January 2012 |isbn=  978-9814328661 }}</ref> and spicy pickled vegetable salad (''[[acar]]'').

Nasi lemak is widely eaten in [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]]. Commonly eaten as breakfast in both countries, it is sold in [[hawker centre]]s and roadside stalls.<ref name="SCMP-1"/>

==Variations==

[[File:Nasi lemak basic.jpg|thumb|Traditional Malaysian nasi lemak in its basic form: [[sambal]], fried anchovies, sliced cucumbers, and boiled egg.]]

In Malaysia and Singapore, nasi lemak comes in many variations, as it is prepared by different chefs from different cultures.

In northwestern [[Peninsular Malaysia]], nasi lemak dishes typically incorporate [[curry]] into their recipe. The sambal served with the dish varies in spiciness, ranging from mild to very spicy.

Hawker centres usually wrap the dish in [[Banana leaf|banana leaves]] to enhance its flavour. Roadside stalls sell it ready-packed, known as ''nasi lemak bungkus'', with prices as lows as RM2.00.<ref>{{Cite web |title=MCO takeaway: Start the day right with RM2 'nasi lemak bungkus' from this PJ Ara Damansara food truck |url=https://malaysia.news.yahoo.com/mco-takeaway-start-day-rm2-025138983.html |date=16 June 2021 |access-date=28 October 2025 |website=Malay Mail via Yahoo News}}</ref>

===Malaysia===
====Traditional Malaysian version====
[[File:Stacked packs of nasi lemak, Seremban.jpg|thumb|upright|Stacked packs of nasi lemak in a ''[[Warung#Terminology|kedai makan]]'' in [[Seremban]]]]

A traditional Malaysian nasi lemak calls for rice and a serving of sambal, anchovies, peanuts, and boiled egg.

While the dish is typically made using white rice, [[brown rice]] can also be used.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://recipeland.com/recipe/v/healthier-nasi-lemak-56110 |title= Healthier Nasi Lemak |access-date=20 November 2021}}</ref> Cooked with fresh coconut milk, with [[Pandanus amaryllifolius|pandanus leaves]] thrown in, the dish is served on banana leaves.

====Alor Setar variant====
{{See also|Nasi kandar}}
[[File:Nasi Lemak Utara.jpg|thumb|upright|An [[Alor Setar]]-style nasi lemak served with curry and an omelette]]

Also known as ''nasi lemak kuning'' ("yellow nasi lemak"), or ''nasi lemak royale'', this version is prevalent around parts of northern [[Kedah]], especially in [[Alor Setar]], as well as in the state of [[Perlis]]. The rice is yellow in colour and commonly eaten with curries.

As both variations of nasi lemak are widely available in northern Kedah and Perlis, locals commonly refer to the traditional dish as ''nasi lemak daun pisang'' ("banana leaf nasi lemak").

====Terengganu variant====
In the east-coast state of [[Terengganu]], ''ikan aye/aya/tongkol'' ("[[mackerel tuna]]") is often added to the dish.

====Malacca variant====
[[File:Nasi Lemak biasa with kangkung.jpg|thumb|Malaccan ''nasi lemak kangkung'']]

In [[Malacca]], ''[[kangkung]]'' is usually served together with nasi lemak, a contrast from the [[cucumber]] that is commonly used in the standard version of the dish.

====Malaysian Chinese variant====
Although it is not common to see [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] stalls and restaurants selling nasi lemak, there is a non-[[halal]] version that contains pork, sold in towns and cities such as Malacca, [[Penang]], [[Perak]], and certain parts of [[Kuala Lumpur]].

====Malaysian Indian variant====
The [[Malaysian Indian]] variation is similar to the original one. As many Malaysian Indians are [[Hinduism|Hindus]], however, and thus do not eat beef, their variant of nasi lemak is often served with chicken curry, fish curry, or lamb curry, as well as with dishes like chicken [[Spice mix#Masala|masala]] or chicken [[Poriyal#Etymology|varuval]].

====Vegetarian variant====
[[File:Vegetarian Nasi Lemak.jpg|thumb|right|Vegetarian nasi lemak]]

In certain parts of Malaysia and Singapore, hawkers and restaurants may offer [[vegetarian]] nasi lemak. In this version, the dried anchovies and the [[shrimp paste]] for sambal are replaced with vegetarian substitutes. Vegetarian nasi lemak can also be served with stir-fried vegetables and plant-based imitation fish or [[Meat alternative|meat]].

====Strawberry variant====
This variant is usually regarded as a unique [[Cameron Highlands]] specialty, where [[strawberries]] are commercially grown. The fruit is added to the sambal, and the rice is coloured dark pink.

===Indonesia===
Across the [[Malacca Strait]], the [[Malay Indonesian]]s of the Sumatran east coast share a common heritage and [[Malay cuisine|cuisine]] with their Malaysian counterparts. As a result, nasi lemak is also native to the provinces of [[Riau Islands]] and [[Riau]].<ref name="Batamnews">{{Cite web |first=Ruzi |last=Wiranata |title=Nasi Lemak, Menu Sarapan Pagi Favorit di Kepri |url=https://www.batamnews.co.id/berita-97450-nasi-lemak-menu-sarapan-pagi-favorit-di-kepri.html |date=21 March 2023|access-date=11 September 2023 |website=batamnews.co.id |language=id}}</ref>

====Riau variant====
[[File:Stamp of Indonesia - 2008 - Colnect 385171 - Nasi Lemak.jpeg|thumb|left|An Indonesian stamp depicting nasi lemak as a local dish of [[Riau]] province]]

In [[Pekanbaru]] city, Riau province, locally caught freshwater river fishes are commonly used to accompany nasi lemak. These include ''ikan selais'' (''[[Kryptopterus cryptopterus]]''), ''ikan patin'' (''[[Pangasius]]''), and ''ikan lomek'' (''[[Harpadon nehereus]]''). The fish are usually cooked in [[Padang food|Minang]]-style ''lado ijo'' (green chili pepper), minced and fried as ''perkedel ikan'', or just plain fried.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nasi Lemak Pekanbaru|publisher=Melayu Online|url=http://melayuonline.com/ind/culture/dig/1147/nasi-lemak-pekanbaru|access-date=8 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328233239/http://melayuonline.com/ind/culture/dig/1147/nasi-lemak-pekanbaru|archive-date=28 March 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Other than fried fish, Pekanbaru's nasi lemak might also be served with fried [[tempeh]], beef prepared as ''[[gulai]]'' or ''[[rendang]]'', and also stir-fried [[long beans]], often cooked in spicy coconut milk.<ref>{{Cite web |date=27 March 2023 |title=Makanan Khas Riau Mulai dari Makanan Berat hingga Makanan Ringan |url=https://gramedia.com/best-seller/makanan-khas-riau-mulai/ |access-date=7 September 2023 |website=Gramedia |language=id-ID}}</ref>

====Medan variant====
[[File:Nasi Lemak Medan Rendang 3.jpg|thumb|right|Nasi lemak Medan with ''emping'' and potato crisps, sweet fried [[tempeh]], beef [[rendang]], egg ''balado'', ''perkedel'', and cucumber, topped with egg bits and fried shallot]]

The [[Medan]] [[Sultanate of Deli|Melayu Deli]] version of nasi lemak is usually served with a choice of side dishes, either ''rendang'' (beef or chicken) or ''[[Balado (food)|balado]]'' (egg or shrimp in chili sauce). It may additionally include a sprinkle of crispy fried [[shallot]], slices of omelette, ''[[kripik]] kentang balado'' (spicy potato chips), ''tempe orek'' (seasoned fried tempeh), ''[[perkedel]]'' (fried potato patties), sambal chili paste, and slightly bitter ''[[emping]]'' crackers.<ref name="Kompas Nasi Lemak Medan"/>

Next to ''rendang'' and ''balado'', the vegetable dish ''sayur masak lemak'' (vegetables including long beans, cabbage, and long green chilies in coconut milk) is also offered. It is a popular [[street food]] in Medan, sold in small ''[[warung]]'', usually together with [[Lontong|''lontong'' Medan]].<ref>{{cite web | date = 21 May 2007 | title = Medan on a Plate | work = Eating Asia | url = http://eatingasia.typepad.com/eatingasia/2007/05/the_best_nasi_l.html}}</ref>

====Singaporean Chinese variant====
Retaining the familiar aroma of pandan leaves, the Singaporean Chinese variation of nasi lemak comes with a variety of sides that include deep-fried [[chicken drumstick]]s, chicken [[Sausage|franks]], [[fish cake]], curried vegetables, and [[Bighead carp|tongsan]] [[lunch meat|luncheon meat]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=15 July 2019|title=Is nasi lemak from Malaysia or Singapore?|url=https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/travel-food/article/3018591/nasi-lemak-malaysia-or-singapore-and-how-did-it-get-its|access-date=3 November 2020|website=South China Morning Post}}</ref>

==Similar dishes==
{{main|Coconut rice}}

Nasi lemak's closest analogue is probably the Sumatran ''[[nasi gemuk]]'' (lit. "fatty rice"), commonly found in the Indonesian cities of [[Jambi (city)|Jambi]] and [[Palembang]]. The two dishes are essentially the same, and they differ mainly in name, where ''lemak'' is synonymous with ''gemuk'' in [[Jambi Malay|Jambi]] and [[Palembang language|Palembang Malay]].<ref name="Amalia-Detik">{{Cite web |last=Amalia |first=Lita |title=Gurihnya Nasi Gemuk Khas Jambi, Yuk Bikin! |url=https://www.detik.com/sumut/kuliner/d-6606753/gurihnya-nasi-gemuk-khas-jambi-yuk-bikin |access-date=7 September 2023 |website=detiksumut |language=id-ID}}</ref>

Other, similar regional dishes that use rice cooked in coconut milk include ''[[nasi uduk]]'' from Jakarta, ''[[nasi gurih]]'' from [[Aceh]], and the [[Javanese cuisine|Javanese]] ''[[nasi liwet]]''.<ref name="Nasi Uduk Kompas.id">{{Cite web |date=7 September 2023 |title=Semerbak Aroma Rempah Nasi Uduk Betawi |url=https://interaktif.kompas.id/baca/semerbak-aroma-rempah-nasi-uduk-betawi/ |access-date=18 September 2023 |website=Tutur Visual – Kompas.id |language=id}}</ref>

[[File:Nasi Lemak Lemuni.jpg|thumb|right|Preparation of ''[[nasi lemuni]]'']]

''[[Nasi lemuni]]'' is a similar savoury rice dish traditionally found in northern Peninsular Malaysia. Its preparation is similar to that of nasi lemak, though the inclusion of ''lemuni'' leaf (''[[Vitex trifolia]]'') makes it distinctive.

''[[Nasi katok]]'' is another similar dish, this one from Brunei Darussalam, which uses plain white rice rather than coconut rice.

==Health==
In March 2016, nasi lemak was mentioned as one of the healthy international breakfast foods by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://time.com/4254125/healthy-international-breakfast/|title=10 Healthy International Breakfasts|last1=This|first1=Mike Dunphy / Eat|last2=That!|first2=Not|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=21 March 2016 |access-date=6 April 2016}}</ref> However, a single, full-size serving of nasi lemak, with the addition of fried chicken, meat, or fish, can be between 800 and well over 1,000 calories. The coconut milk-infused rice also contains [[saturated fat]], an ingredient connected to health issues such as [[diabetes]].<ref>{{cite news | work = Star2.com | title = Is nasi lemak really a healthy dish? | date = 31 March 2016 | author = Chris Chan | url = http://www.star2.com/living/viewpoints/2016/03/31/is-nasi-lemak-really-a-healthy-dish/ | access-date = 21 October 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161021175334/http://www.star2.com/living/viewpoints/2016/03/31/is-nasi-lemak-really-a-healthy-dish/ | archive-date = 21 October 2016 | url-status = dead }}</ref>
