{{lang|sv|'''Surströmming'''|i=no}} ({{IPA|sv|ˈsʉ̂ːˌʂʈrœmːɪŋ|pron}}; {{langnf|sv||sour herring}}) is [[Brining|lightly salted]], [[Fermentation in food processing|fermented]] [[Baltic Sea]] [[herring]] traditional to [[Swedish cuisine]] since at least the [[16th century]]. It is distinct from fried or [[pickled herring]].

The [[Baltic herring]], known as {{wikt-lang|sv|strömming}} in Swedish, is smaller than the [[Atlantic herring]] found in the [[North Sea]]. Traditionally, {{lang|sv|strömming}} is defined as herring caught in the [[brackish]] waters of the Baltic north of the [[Kalmar Strait]].<ref>They are about one-third the size of North Sea herring (Swedish {{wikt-lang|sv|sill}}) that is adapted to salt water. {{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/dewa/giwa/areas/reports/r17/executive_summary_giwa_r17.pdf |title=GIWA Regional Assessment 17 - Baltic Sea: Executive summary |work=UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221122226/http://www.unep.org/dewa/giwa/areas/reports/r17/executive_summary_giwa_r17.pdf |archive-date=2015-02-21 }}</ref> The herring used for {{lang|sv|surströmming|i=no}} are caught prior to [[Spawn (biology)|spawning]] in April and May.

During the production of surströmming, just enough [[salt]] is used to prevent the raw herring from [[decomposition|rotting]] while allowing it to [[Fermentation|ferment]]. A [[Fermented fish|fermentation process]] of at least six months gives the fish its characteristic strong smell and somewhat acidic taste.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hákarl: Surströmming: The Swedish Stinky Fish Delicacy

At the end of the 1940s, surströmming producers in Sweden lobbied for a [[King in Council (Sweden)|royal ordinance]] ({{langx|sv|förordning|link=no}}) that would prevent incompletely fermented fish from being sold. The decree that was issued forbade sales of the current year's production in Sweden prior to the third Thursday in August. While the ordinance is no longer in force, retailers still maintain the date for the "premiere" of that year's catch.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nordiskamuseet.se/aretsdagar/surstrommingspremiaren |title=''Surströmmingspremiären'' |date=February 26, 2013 |website=Nordiska museet}}</ref>

== Origin ==
Surströmming has been part of [[Norrland|northern]] [[Swedish cuisine]] since at least the 16th century.

[[Fermented fish]] is a traditional staple in European cuisines. The oldest archeological findings of fish fermentation are 9,200 years old and originate from the south of today's Sweden.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/643791 |title=Signs of early settlement in the Nordic region date back to the cradle of civilization |work=EurekAlert! |date=8 February 2016 |access-date=15 November 2023 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305440316000170 |doi=10.1016/j.jas.2016.01.008 |title=Something rotten in Scandinavia: The world's earliest evidence of fermentation |date=2016 |last1=Boethius |first1=Adam |journal=Journal of Archaeological Science |volume=66 |pages=169–180 |bibcode=2016JArSc..66..169B |url-access=subscription }}</ref> More recent examples include [[garum]], a fermented fish sauce made by the ancient Greeks and Romans, and [[Worcestershire sauce]], which also contains fermented fish.

Preservation of fish through fermentation in weak [[brine]] may have developed when brining was still expensive due to the cost of salt.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kurlansky M|chapter=Chapter 8. A Nordic Dream|title=Salt: A World History|page=138| location=London| publisher=Vintage Books| isbn=978-0-09-928199-3 |year=2003}}</ref> In modern times, the fish are initially marinated in a strong brine solution that draws out the blood, then fermented in a weaker brine in barrels prior to canning.

The [[canning]] procedure, introduced in the 19th century, enabled the product to be marketed in shops and stored at home, whereas formerly the final stage would have been stored in large wooden barrels and smaller, one-litre kegs. Canning also enabled the product to be marketed farther south in Sweden.

== Chemical process ==
Fermentation occurs through [[autolysis (biology)|autolysis]] and starts from a [[lactic acid]] [[enzyme]] in the spine of the fish. Together with bacteria, pungent smelling acids are formed, such as [[propionic acid]], [[butyric acid]] and [[acetic acid]]. [[Hydrogen sulfide]] is also produced. The salt raises the [[osmotic pressure]] of the brine above the zone where bacteria responsible for rotting can thrive and prevents decomposition of proteins into [[oligopeptide]]s and [[amino acid]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Instead, the osmotic conditions enable ''[[Halanaerobium]]'' bacteria such as ''[[Halanaerobium praevalens |H. praevalens]]'' to thrive and decompose the fish [[glycogen]] into [[organic acid]]s, making it sour (acidic).<ref name=Halanaerobium/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kobayashi |first1=T. |last2=Kimura |first2=B. |last3=Fujii |first3=T. |title=Strictly anaerobic halophiles isolated from canned Swedish fermented herrings (Surströmming) |url-status=live |journal=[[International Journal of Food Microbiology]] |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |volume=54 |issue=1–2 |pages=81–89 |doi=10.1016/s0168-1605(99)00172-5 |pmid=10746577 |url=http://higiene.unex.es/bibliogr/Microorg/IJFM0081.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220323062243/http://higiene.unex.es/bibliogr/Microorg/IJFM0081.pdf |archive-date=2022-03-23 |access-date=2022-03-22 |date=2000-03-10|s2cid=33472888 }}</ref>

== Production and market ==
[[File:Oskar's suströmming.jpg|thumb|A can of Surströmming, with the top noticeably bulging due to fermented gases being released]]
The herring are caught in May and June, when they are in prime condition and about to spawn, and have not yet fattened. They are put into a strong brine for about 20 hours that draws out the blood, after which the heads and innards are removed and the fish is put into a weaker brine solution. The barrels are placed in a temperature-controlled room kept at {{convert|15–18|C|F}}. Canning takes place at the beginning of July and for three to four weeks thereafter. Ten days prior to the premiere the final product is distributed to wholesalers.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=2023-03-07 |title=Surströmming |url=https://levandekulturarv.se/in-english/the-inventory/submissions/surstromming |access-date= |website=Levande kulturarv |language=en}}</ref> The fermentation of the fish relies on a lactic acid enzyme in the spine that is activated if the conditions, temperature and brine concentration, are right. The low temperature in Northern Sweden is one of the elements that contribute to the character of the final product.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Prior to the development of modern canning methods, surströmming was sold in wooden barrels for immediate consumption, as even the smaller kegs could leak.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.surstromming.se/historia/historia-1800-talet-1.htm |title=''Surströmmingens historia - 1800-talet'' |website=www.surstromming.se}}</ref>

Fermentation continues in the can, causing it to bulge noticeably, which would usually be a sign of [[botulism]] or other [[food poisoning]] concern in non-fermented canned foods. Species of ''[[Halanaerobium]]'' bacteria are responsible for the in-can ripening. These bacteria produce [[carbon dioxide]] and a number of compounds that account for the unique odor: pungent ([[propionic acid]]), rotten-egg ([[hydrogen sulfide]]), rancid-butter ([[butyric acid]]), and vinegary ([[acetic acid]]).<ref name=Halanaerobium>{{cite book |author=McGee, Harold |title=On Food and Cooking |edition=Revised |publisher=Scribner |year=2004 |isbn=0-684-80001-2 |page= 236}}</ref> Due to these gases, a thousand cans of surströmming exploded over a period of six hours during a fire at a Swedish warehouse in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sweden fire turns cans of rotten fish into exploding missiles |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-27258303 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=May 2, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= ''Surströmmingsburkar exploderade när sjöbod brann'' |trans-title=Fermented herring cans exploded when boathouse burned |url=https://www.helahalsingland.se/artikel/surstrommingsburkar-exploderade-nar-sjobod-brann |website=helahälsingland |publisher=MittMedia |language=sv |date=May 1, 2014}}</ref>

Surströmming is commonly sold in grocery stores all over Sweden. According to the Surströmming Academy's statistics from 2009, about 2 million people eat surströmming annually. Sweden's export of surströmming is only 0.2 percent of all produced surströmming.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Surströmming Academy about surströmming today|url=https://www.surstrommingsakademien.se/historia/idag/ |website=surstrommingsakademien.se |language=sv |access-date=13 August 2022}}</ref>

Many people do not care for surströmming.<ref name=ban /> As with the Nordic dried-fish dish ''[[lutefisk]]'',{{citation needed |date=July 2023}} it is a food that meets strong reactions. It is more popular in northern Sweden than in other parts of the country.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2017-08-17 |title=Nu är det många som äter surströmming |language=sv |work=Sveriges Radio |url=https://sverigesradio.se/artikel/6758457 |access-date=2023-08-28}}</ref>

{{As of |2023}}, over the past few years, the supply of Baltic and other herring caught by Swedish fishermen has dramatically declined. Baltic herring fisheries have been used unsustainably since the [[Middle Ages]], and [[overfishing]] is pushing populations to the brink of collapse. With such low catch numbers, retailers are now selling out their entire supply within minutes of the annual surströmming release.<ref>{{cite news |title=Coastal fishermen report dramatically smaller herring catches in the Baltic Sea - Radio Sweden {{!}} Sveriges Radio |first=Mona |last=Hambraeus |url=https://sverigesradio.se/artikel/coastal-fishermen-report-dramatically-smaller-herring-catches-in-the-baltic-sea |newspaper=Sveriges Radio |date=2022-07-26 |access-date=2023-07-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Supply of 'smelly' fermenting herring not meeting Swedish demand {{!}} Courthouse News Service |first=Lasse |last=Sørensen |url=https://www.courthousenews.com/supply-of-smelly-fermenting-herring-not-meeting-swedish-demand/ |website=www.courthousenews.com |date=2022-08-20 |access-date=2023-07-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Overfishing of Baltic herring already in 13th century {{!}} University of Gothenburg |first1=Olof |last1=Lönnehed |first2=Carl |last2=André |url=https://www.gu.se/en/news/overfishing-of-baltic-herring-already-in-13th-century |website=www.gu.se |date=2022-10-28 |access-date=2023-07-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Surströmming: the infamous Swedish fermented fish that's putridly fascinating |first1=Mihai |last1=Andrei |first2=Tibi |last2=Puiu |url=https://www.zmescience.com/feature-post/what-is-surstromming-fish/ |website=www.zmescience.com |date=2023-04-28 |access-date=2023-07-16}}</ref>

== Preparation ==
[[File:Surströmmingstallrik.JPG|thumb|right|Surströmming served on [[tunnbröd]] (a Swedish [[flatbread]]) with boiled potatoes and vegetables]]
[[File:Surstroemmngsklaemma.png|thumb|260px|Surströmming with potatoes and onion on buttered [[tunnbröd]], served with a glass of milk]]

Swedes usually consume surströmming after the third Thursday of August, labeled as "Surströmming day", through early September.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://rove.me/to/sweden/surstromming-or-sour-herring |title=Surströmming or Sour Herring |date=25 April 2019 |access-date=April 25, 2019}}</ref> Because of the strong smell, it is often eaten outdoors. The pressurized can is usually opened some distance away from the dining table and is often initially punctured while immersed in a bucket of water, or after tapping and angling it upwards at 45 degrees, to prevent escaping gas from spraying brine.

Surströmming comes both ungutted with only the heads removed and as [[Fish fillet|fillets]]. With the former, the fish is [[gutted]] prior to eating, and the backbone and sometimes the skin are removed. The [[roe]] is commonly eaten along with the fish.

Surströmming is often eaten with [[tunnbröd]], either soft or a crispy type of flatbread made of different kind of [[flour]], sometimes it also contains milk and bread spices.<ref name="ta">{{cite web |title=Vad är tunnbröd? |url=https://tunnbrodsakademin.se/vad-ar-tunnbrod/ |publisher=Tunnbrödsakademin |access-date=17 October 2024 |language=Swedish}}</ref> Crispy tunnbröd has a bubbly texture and is more brittle than typical [[crispbread]] made of [[rye]].<ref name="ta"/><ref>{{cite web |title=''Olika sätt att äta surströmming'' |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/matvin/article10648441.ab |website=www.aftonbladet.se |publisher=[[Aftonbladet]] |access-date=24 May 2015}}</ref> The use of tunnbröd originated in the [[The High Coast|High Coast]] area, where the tradition is to make a sandwich (known as a ''surströmmingsklämma'') with two pieces of buttered hard tunnbröd. In addition to the fish, the two most common toppings are potatoes (either sliced or mashed, often [[almond potato]]es) and finely diced red onion. Surströmming is also commonly eaten without bread, with potatoes and red onion. To counterbalance the strong flavour of the fish, [[Västerbotten cheese]] is sometimes added.<ref name="Eat">{{cite web |last1=Lyregård |first1=Berit |date=11 August 2005 |title=Surströmming ska ätas med finess |url=http://www.dn.se/mat-dryck/reportage/surstromming-ska-atas-med-finess/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124050212/http://www.dn.se/mat-dryck/reportage/surstromming-ska-atas-med-finess/ |archive-date=24 January 2016 |access-date=24 May 2015 |website=[[Dagens Nyheter]]}}</ref>

In the southern part of Sweden, it is customary to use a variety of condiments such as diced red onion, ''[[gräddfil]]'' (fat fermented [[sour cream]] similar to [[Smetana (dairy product)|smetana]]) or [[crème fraîche]], [[chives]], and sometimes tomato and chopped [[dill]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Schmidt |first1=Claes |last2=Lund |first2=Sara |title=Kulturkrock! |url=http://saraclaes.allas.se/kulturkrock/ |website=www.allas.se |publisher=Allas |access-date=2015-05-24 |archive-date=2017-02-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224052728/http://saraclaes.allas.se/kulturkrock/ }}</ref>

Surströmming is commonly served with ''[[snaps]]'', light beers like [[pilsner]] or [[lager]], [[svagdricka]] (a type of [[small beer]]), water, or cold [[milk]]. What to drink with surströmming is disputed among [[connoisseur]]s. Surströmming is usually served as the focus of a traditional festivity called a ''surströmmingsskiva''.

[[File:OSFC 2010 4 Tilson.JPG|thumb|Oxford Symposium on Food & Cookery, 2010. Held at [[St Catherine's College, Oxford|St Catherine's college]], [[Oxfordshire]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]]]
German [[food critic]] and author Wolfgang Fassbender wrote that "the biggest challenge when eating surströmming is to [[vomit]] only after the first bite, as opposed to before".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://nachgewuerzt.blog.nzz.ch/2011/08/22/grauen-in-der-dose/ |title=Wolfgang Fassbender in Swiss newspaper ''Neue Zürcher Zeitung'', August 2011. |access-date=2011-09-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124044024/http://nachgewuerzt.blog.nzz.ch/2011/08/22/grauen-in-der-dose/ |archive-date=2011-11-24 }}</ref>

=== European Union ===
Due to being made from herring from the [[Baltic Sea]], surströmming today contains higher levels of [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]] and [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]] than permitted in the [[European Union|EU]]. Sweden was granted exceptions to these rules from 2002 to 2011 and then applied for a renewal of the exceptions. Producers have said that if the application is denied, they will only be allowed to use herring less than {{convert|17|cm}} long, as those contain lower levels, which will affect the availability of herring.<ref>{{cite news |trans-title=Sour Herring is Saved |title=Surströmmingen är räddad |lang=sv |url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/inrikes/surstrommingen-ar-raddad |work=[[Västerbottens-Kuriren]] |access-date=2011-09-06 |date=8 April 2011}}</ref>{{update inline |date=March 2022}}

=== German eviction ===
In 1981, a landlord evicted a tenant without notice after the tenant intentionally spread surströmming brine in the apartment building's stairwell on the night of 24–25 December. The matter was brought to court due to the tenant disputing the validity of the eviction's reasoning. In January 1984, the [[Landesgericht (Germany)|regional court]] of [[Cologne]] ruled that the termination was justified after the landlord's party demonstrated their case by opening a can inside the courtroom. The ruling cited a violation of the tenant agreement per § 573 [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|''Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch'']], stating that the court "had convinced itself that the disgusting smell of the fish brine far exceeded the degree that fellow-tenants in the building could be expected to tolerate".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://db.mietgerichtstag.de/tl_files/Dateien/Mietgerichtstage/2005/pfeifer.pdf |title = Störung des Mietgebrauchs durch Mieter |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329133211/http://db.mietgerichtstag.de/tl_files/Dateien/Mietgerichtstage/2005/pfeifer.pdf |archive-date=March 29, 2017 |date=March 29, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=2013-12-24 |title=Ordentliche Kündigung eines Mieters wegen Verspritzens von Fischpökelbrühe im Treppenhaus zulässig |url=https://urteile.news/LG-Koeln_1-S-17183_Ordentliche-Kuendigung-eines-Mieters-wegen-Verspritzens-von-Fischpoekelbruehe-im-Treppenhaus-zulaessig~N16672 |access-date= |website=Urteile.news |language=DE}}</ref>

=== Airline bans ===
In April 2006, several major airlines (such as [[Air France]], [[British Airways]], [[Finnair]], and [[KLM]]) banned the fish,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fishupdate.com/swedish-fermented-herring-dish-considered-safety-risk-on-airlines-fishupdate-com/ |title=Swedish fermented herring dish considered safety risk on airlines |date=September 22, 2014 |access-date=April 25, 2019 |archive-date=April 25, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425153200/https://www.fishupdate.com/swedish-fermented-herring-dish-considered-safety-risk-on-airlines-fishupdate-com/ }}</ref> claiming that the pressurised cans of fish are potentially explosive. The sale of the fish was subsequently discontinued at [[Stockholm Arlanda Airport]]. Those who produce the fish have called the airlines' decision "culturally illiterate", claiming that it is a "myth that the tinned fish can explode".<ref name=ban>{{cite web |last =  Bevanger |first = Lars |title = Airlines ban 'foul' Swedish fish |url = https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4867024.stm |publisher = [[BBC]]|website=BBC News |access-date = 2007-09-24 |date=1 April 2006}}</ref>

== Museum ==
On 4 June 2005, the first surströmming museum in the world was opened in Skeppsmalen, {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} south-east of [[Örnsköldsvik]], a town at the northern end of the High Coast.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ta en tur med vädret |url=http://www.expressen.se/res/ta-en-tur-med-vadret/ |website=www.expressen.se |publisher=[[Expressen]] |date=18 July 2005 |access-date=24 May 2015}}</ref> The name of the museum is ''Fiskevistet'' (translated as 'The Fish Encampment').
