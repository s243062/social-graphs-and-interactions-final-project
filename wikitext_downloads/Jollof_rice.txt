'''Jollof''' ({{IPAc-en|dʒ|ə|'|l|ɒ|f}}), or '''jollof''' '''rice''', is a [[rice dish]] from [[Senegal]], West Africa.<ref>{{Cite web |title=UNESCO - Ceebu Jën, a culinary art of Senegal |url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/ceebu-jn-a-culinary-art-of-senegal-01748 |access-date=2024-03-31 |website=ich.unesco.org}}</ref> It is typically made with [[long-grain rice]], tomatoes, [[Chili pepper|chilis]], onions, spices, and sometimes other vegetables and/or meat in a single pot, although its ingredients and preparation methods vary across different regions.

Regional variations are a source of competition among the countries of West Africa, and in particular between [[Nigerian cuisine|Nigeria]] and [[Ghanaian cuisine|Ghana]]; in the 2010s this developed into a friendly rivalry known as the "Jollof wars".

In French-speaking West Africa, a variation of the dish is known as [[riz au gras]]. The Senegalese version, [[thieboudienne]], has been recognized by UNESCO as an [[intangible cultural heritage]] dish.

==History and origin==
The [[Jolof Empire|Jolof]] or Wolof Empire was a confederacy state that ruled parts of [[West Africa]] situated in modern-day [[Senegal]], [[Mali]], [[The Gambia]] and [[Mauritania]] from around the 12th century<ref name=":3">{{cite book |last1=Boulègue |first1=Jean |title=Le Grand Jolof, XIIIe-XVIe siècle |date=1987 |publisher=Façades |isbn=9782907233002 |location=Blois |language=fr}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite book |last1=Gamble |first1=David P. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TwIOAQAAMAAJ |title=Peoples of the Gambia: The Wolof.

Food and agriculture historian James C. McCann argued that it was unlikely that the dish could have naturally spread from Senegal to its current range since a similar cultural diffusion is not seen in "[[Linguistics|linguistic]], historical or political patterns". Instead, he proposed that the dish spread with the [[Mali empire]], especially the [[Dyula people|Djula tradespeople]] who dispersed widely to the regional commercial and urban centers, taking with them economic arts of "blacksmithing, small-scale marketing, and rice agronomy" as well as the religion of [[Islam]].<ref name="McCann" />

Marc Dufumier, an [[Emeritus Professor|emeritus professor]] of [[agronomy]], proposes a more recent origin for the dish, which may only have appeared as a consequence of the colonial promotion of intensive [[peanut]] cropping in central Senegal for the French oil industry, and where commensurate reduction in the planted area of traditional [[millet]] and [[sorghum]] staples was compensated for by imports of broken rice from [[Southeast Asia]]. This gave local cooks no choice but to use the then-unfamiliar product.<ref name="Dufumier-2018">{{cite web|title= Recette : le thiéboudiène de Marc Dufumier |first= Marc |last= Dufumier | url= https://www.lemonde.fr/m-gastronomie/article/2018/03/30/recette-le-thieboudiene-de-marc-dufumier_5278664_4497540.html |date= March 30, 2018| publisher= [[Le Monde]] |access-date= 2018-10-27}}</ref>

The use of [[Columbian exchange|New World]] tomatoes, tomato paste, [[capsicum]] peppers ([[Bell pepper|bell]], [[Chili pepper|chili]], [[paprika]]), Indian [[curry powder]], Mediterranean [[thyme]], and Asian rice varieties, may limit the origin of the current dish to no earlier than the 19th century, there being no evidence of the ingredients being locally cultivated or imported before this period.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Alpern |first=Stanley B. |date=1992 |title=The European Introduction of Crops into West Africa in Precolonial Times |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3171994 |journal=History in Africa |volume=19 |pages=13–43 |doi=10.2307/3171994 |jstor=3171994 |s2cid=163106670 |issn=0361-5413|url-access=subscription }}</ref><ref name="Vegan" /> In Senegal, oral histories credit Penda Mbaye, a cook at the residence of one of the colonial rulers in [[Saint-Louis, Senegal]], as having created the dish when she ran out of [[barley]] and substituted rice.<ref name="Vegan">{{Cite web |last=Kokayi |first=Saqera |date=2021-03-18 |title=The History of Jollof Rice |url=https://bestofvegan.com/food-history-the-history-of-jollof-rice/ |access-date=2023-05-15 |website=[[Best of Vegan]] |language=en}}</ref><ref name="Dufumier-2018" /><ref>{{Cite web |last=Afana |first=Clementine |date=31 March 2020 |title=Senegalese Thieboudienne Is a Dish That Feeds, Satisfies, and Unites |url=https://matadornetwork.com/read/senegalese-thieboudienne-dish-feeds-satisfies-unites/ |access-date=2023-09-18 |website=[[Matador Network]] |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Geographical range and variants==
Jollof rice is one of the most common dishes in West Africa. There are several regional variations in name and ingredients;<ref name="Diner's Dictionary">{{cite book|last1=Ayto|first1=John|title=The Diner's Dictionary: Word Origins of Food and Drink|edition=2nd|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199640249|page=[https://archive.org/details/dinersdictionary0000ayto/page/188 188]|url=https://archive.org/details/dinersdictionary0000ayto|url-access=registration|chapter=Jollof rice}}</ref> for example, in Mali it is called ''zaamè'' in [[Bamanankan]]. The dish's most common name of ''jollof'' derives from the name of the [[Wolof people]],<ref name="Asare">{{cite book|last=Osseo-Asare|first=Fran|title=Food Culture in Sub-Saharan Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1s-a7EMM6BgC&pg=FA162|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-32488-8|pages=33, 162}}</ref> though in Senegal, Mauritania and The Gambia the dish is referred to in Wolof as ''[[ceebu jën]]'' or ''benachin''.

[[File:Ingredients for jollof rice.jpg|thumb|Typical ingredients for a jollof with fish, clockwise from top left: chili peppers, tomatoes, tomato paste, ground nut oil, rice, salt, bouillon cube, fish, onion]]
Jollof rice traditionally consists of rice, cooking oil, tomato puree, onion, salt, chilies, and often some combination of other ingredients such as [[tomato paste]], [[bell pepper]], garlic, ginger, [[thyme]], [[curry powder]], bay leaves, [[Grains of Selim|grains of selim]], and [[Bouillon cube|bouillon cubes]] or [[Stock (food)|stock]]; recipes vary from country to country and cook to cook. Chicken, turkey, beef, lamb or fish are often cooked with or served with the dish.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Classic Nigerian Jollof Rice Recipe on Food52|url=https://food52.com/recipes/61557-classic-nigerian-jollof-rice| access-date=2021-02-27| website=Food52}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://buzzghana.com/ghana-jollof-recipe-steps/|title=Ghana Jollof Recipe: Steps To Preparing Jollof Rice The Ghanaian Way|date=2017-09-05|website=BuzzGhana|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref><ref name="Sloley 2021">{{cite web | last=Sloley | first=Patti | title=Jollof Wars: Who does West Africa's iconic rice dish best? | website=BBC Travel | date=7 June 2021 | url=https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20210607-jollof-wars-who-does-west-africas-iconic-rice-dish-best | access-date=16 July 2021}}</ref> In some countries, other vegetables such as cabbage, green peas, or carrots are included.<ref name="Sokoh-2022" />

West African countries typically have at least one variant form of the dish, with [[Ghana]], [[Nigeria]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]] and [[Cameroon]] particularly competitive as to which country makes the best jollof.<ref name="Sloley 2021" /> In the mid-2010s this expanded into the "Jollof Wars".<ref>{{Cite news |date=2017-08-25 |title=West Africa steams over jollof rice war |language=en-GB |work=[[BBC News]] |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-41053424 |access-date=2023-09-18}}</ref>

===Ghana===
[[File:Jollof Rice Ghana.jpg|thumb|Ghanaian jollof rice]]
Ghanaian jollof rice is made of vegetable oil, [[onion]], ginger, pressed [[garlic]] cloves, [[chillies]], tomato paste, [[beef]] or [[goat meat]] or [[Chicken as food|chicken]] (sometimes alternated with mixed vegetables), local or refined rice, typically jasmine rice and [[black pepper]].<ref name="FoodMap" /> Ghanaian jollof typically does not include any green leafy vegetables.<ref name="Egbejule-2016" />

The method of cooking Ghanaian jollof begins with first preparing the beef or chicken by seasoning and steaming it with a pureé of ginger, onions and garlic and frying it until it is well-cooked.<ref name="FoodMap">{{cite web|title=Ghana: Jollof Rice|url=http://www.africanfoodmap.com/recipes/recipe-3/|website= The African Food Map|access-date=15 November 2016}}</ref> The rest of the ingredients are then fried all together, starting from onions, pepper, tomato paste, tomatoes and spices in that order. After all the ingredients have been fried, rice is then added and cooked until the meal is prepared.

===Nigeria===
{{Culture of Nigeria}}
Although considerable variation exists, the basic profile for Nigerian jollof rice includes long-grain [[parboiled rice|rice]] (including golden sella basmati rice), tomatoes puree and/or [[tomato paste]], onions, pepper ([[scotch bonnet]]s and/or [[habanero pepper]]s; [[poblano]]s<ref>Horton E.

[[File:Nigerian Jollof 02.jpg|thumb|Nigerian jollof]]
The important quality of rice used to cook Nigerian one-pot rice recipes, including jollof rice, is that it is [[parboiled rice |parboiled]]. The decision whether to use any of the numerous brands of conventional long-grain parboiled/easy-cook rice (e.g., Tolly Boy, Mama Gold, Dangote Rice, Veetee, Village Pride, Tropical Sun, Mama Pride, Mama Africa, Cap Rice, Uncle Ben’s, Royal Stallion, Carolina Gold) or Golden Sella basmati-parboiled rice (further sub-branded, e.g., Asli, Tilda)<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.schooldrillers.com/rice-brands-and-prices-in-nigeria/ | title=List of Most Popular Rice Brands and Prices in Nigeria. &#124; School Drillers | date=9 December 2021 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://trumpetmediagroup.com/the-trumpet/food-drink/foodies-inspire-xmas-sparkle-with-tolly-boy-rice/ | title=Foodies inspire Xmas sparkle with Tolly Boy Rice | date=15 December 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Children's Science & Nature Software &#124; Buy Children's Science & Nature Software Online in Nigeria &#124; Jumia NG | url=https://www.jumia.com.ng/tropical-sun-golden-sella-pure-basmati-rice-5kg-376088348.html }}</ref> is merely a matter of availability, convenience and/or personal preference and the sub-status of one or the other grain-group being conventional long-grain or basmati long-grain completely irrelevant. What matters is that it is [[parboiled rice |parboiled]] (i.e., partially boiled at the husk when processing). Sella basmati rice, however, is considered more aesthetically pleasing to some.<ref>Aneke, F.O., 2019. SENSORY EVALUATION OF JOLLOF RICE USING DIFFERENT TYPES OF RICE.</ref>

Most of the ingredients are cooked in one pot, of which a rich meat stock or broth and a fried tomato and pepper puree characteristically forms the base. Rice is then added and left to cook in the liquid.<ref name="Komolafe-2019" /> 

The dish is then served with the protein of choice (which in theory may be any meat but often beef, turkey, chicken or croaker-fish; much less commonly lamb, pork, etc.) and very often with fried [[Cooking banana|plantain]]s, [[moin-moin |moi-moi]] (bean pudding), steamed vegetables, [[coleslaw]], salad, etc.

Several variations of prototypal Nigerian jollof rice exist, including coconut-jollof rice.<ref>Abbas, A.M., Agada, I.G. and Kolade, O., 2018. Impacts of rice importation on Nigeria’s economy.

Jollof is culturally important in much of West Africa to the point there is a common saying, "A party without jollof is just a meeting".<ref name="Sokoh-2021" /> In Nigeria the phrase "see jollof" means "see how much fun is being had", according to Nigerian food historian [[Ozoz Sokoh]].<ref name="Sokoh-2021" />

Since the 2010s, there has been increasing interest in West African foods in the western world. Jollof food festivals have been held in [[Washington, DC]], and [[Toronto]]. "World Jollof Day" has been celebrated since 2015 on 22 August, gaining traction on [[social media]], and has helped increased the global recognition of jollof rice.<ref name="Sloley 2021" /><ref name="Sokoh-2021" /> On 3 November 2022, the dish was honoured with a [[Google Doodle]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Google Doodle Celebrates West Africa's Jollof Rice|url=https://www.cnet.com/culture/internet/google-doodle-celebrates-west-africas-jollof-rice/|date=3 November 2022|access-date=4 November 2022|last=Musil|first=Steven|website=[[CNET]]}}</ref>

Some areas also have versions of two related dishes:
* Party jollof or party rice is traditionally cooked outdoors over a wood fire, which gives it a smoky flavor and a crusty "bottom pot" similar to [[Scorched rice|tahdig]] or [[socarrat]], it is prepared with fresh tomato and pepper mix, tomato paste, onions, vegetable oil, spices like thyme, rosemary, curry, meat stock, etc.<ref name="Sokoh-2021" /><ref name="Sokoh-2022">{{Cite web |last=Sokoh |first=Ozoh |author-link=Ozoz Sokoh |date=22 September 2022 |title=Nigerian Jollof Rice Recipe |url=https://www.seriouseats.com/nigerian-jollof-rice-recipe-6741471 |access-date=2023-09-18 |website=[[Serious Eats]] |language=en}}</ref>
* Native rice, also called [[concoction rice]], uses red palm oil and smoked, dried fish and is seasoned with locust beans (also known as iru or dawa-dawa), [[uziza]] seeds and/or [[Ocimum gratissimum |scent leaf]],<ref name="Sokoh-2021" /> (respectively known as nchuanwu, arimu and ahuji in [[Igbo language |Igbo]]; ntong in Efik-Ibibio; efirin in Yoruba, añyeba in [[Igala language |Igala]], aramogbo in [[Edo language |Edo]]; etc.), occasionally sprinkled with cut [[Merremia |''olili'']] (local mint). Concoction rice is a term that may refer to either this or an ‘economically-friendly’ version of either this or conventional jollof rice but in the latter, too, red [[palm oil]] (or [[peanut oil |groundnut oil]]) is more frequently used to cook it than vegetable oils.
