In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], a '''meat pie''' is a handheld savoury [[pie]] containing diced or [[Ground beef|minced meat]] and [[gravy]], sometimes with onion, mushrooms or cheese, and often consumed as a [[Take-out|takeaway]] food snack.

==Commercial production==
[[File:Aussie meat pie (cropped).jpg|thumb|The filling of an Australian meat pie]]
Meat pies are made in numerous neighbourhood bakery shops in Australia and New Zealand.

According to a 2003 study, the average Australian eats more than 12 meat pies each year.<ref name="theage2003" /> According to a 2004 study, the average New Zealander eats 15 meat pies a year.<ref>Andre Taber states that in 2004, business transactions for meat pies in New Zealand were worth NZ$120 million. The average cost of a meat pie was about NZ$2 this puts the sale of meat pies in New Zealand to be 60 million. As New Zealand has a population of 4 million this puts the average consumption per head to 15 per year.

=== Australia ===
Manufacturers of pies in Australia tend to be state-based, reflecting the long distances involved with interstate transport and lack of refrigeration capabilities in the early years of pie production.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Many pies are sold ready-to-eat at smaller outlets and are sold unbranded although some may be locally produced by a brand-name vendor, or even imported. Frozen pies are heated prior to serving.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-04-04/meat-pie-exhibition-tracks-history-of-australia-iconic-fast-food/7297216|title=Meat pies: From ancient fast food to Australian icon|date=4 April 2016|website=abc.net.au|access-date=5 August 2017}}</ref>

An Australian meat pie, first produced in 1947, by L. T. McClure in a small bakery in [[Bendigo]], became the well-known [[Four'n Twenty]] pie. Due to its association with [[Australian rules football]], Four'n Twenty has iconic status in [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]].<ref name="theage2003">{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/07/20/1058639657123.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Bye-bye American pie | date=21 July 2003}}</ref> Other manufacturers well predate this brand.

In 1977, during the time that American fast food restaurants moved into New Zealand, [[Progressive Enterprises]] created [[Georgie Pie]], a [[fast food restaurant]] with a menu based on meat pies. The pies were batch made and frozen at Progressive's [[Māngere]] plant.  The first Georgie Pie restaurant opened in Kelston, [[Auckland]], and at its peak in the mid-1990s had become a chain of 32 restaurants across New Zealand.  However, after a major expansion, Georgie Pie became uneconomic to run and was eventually sold to [[McDonald's New Zealand]] in 1996. The last restaurant at Mission Bay, Auckland, closed in 1998. In June 2013, McDonald's started a trial relaunch of Georgie Pie, selling one flavour of pie (Steak Mince 'n' Cheese) through eleven of its restaurants in Auckland and Hamilton.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/9229767/McDonalds-takes-Georgie-Pie-nationwide|title=McDonald's takes Georgie Pie nationwide|date=1 October 2013|access-date=3 December 2016|via=Stuff.co.nz}}</ref>

==Nutritional value==
The meats allowed by [[FSANZ]] to make up at least 25% of a meat pie are beef, buffalo, camel, venison, goat, hare, pork, poultry, rabbit and sheep. [[Kangaroo meat]], a leaner alternative, is also sometimes used. However, most pie manufacturers specify 'beef' in their ingredients list; typically, those using other types of meat will simply put 'meat' in the list instead. FSANZ requires that a meat pie must contain a minimum of 25% "meat flesh". Meat flesh includes the skeletal muscle of any slaughtered animal as well as any attached animal rind, fat, connective tissue, nerve, blood and blood vessels.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-08-20|title=What's in a meat pie - food and drink|url=https://www.choice.com.au/food-and-drink/meat-fish-and-eggs/meat/articles/whats-in-a-meat-pie|access-date=2021-04-26|website=CHOICE|language=en}}</ref> [[Offal]] (such as brain, heart, kidney, liver, tongue, tripe) must be specified on the label.<ref>[http://www.choice.com.au/viewArticle.aspx?id=105214&catId=100286&tid=100008&p=2&title=Test%3a+Meat+pies Body parts and gravy?]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024195904/http://www.choice.com.au/viewArticle.aspx?id=105214&catId=100286&tid=100008&p=2&title=Test%3A%20Meat%20pies |date=24 October 2007 }} – CHOICE May 2006</ref>
