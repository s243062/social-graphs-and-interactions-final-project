==Procedure==

* Rinse the rice thoroughly and drain well.

* Add water to a pot and bring it to a boil.

* Pour the rinsed rice into the boiling water.

* Reduce the heat and simmer until the water is fully absorbed and the rice becomes soft and sticky. If the rice remains hard, add more water as needed and continue cooking.

* Once the rice is soft, use a spatula to mash it thoroughly until it forms a smooth, dough-like consistency.

* Mold the mashed rice into a desired shape using a container, or wrap it in nylon to hold the shape.

* Serve hot with your favorite soup.<ref name=":2" />
