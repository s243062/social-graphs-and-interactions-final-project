== Etymology ==
The word derives from the Arabic root {{Transliteration|ar|harasa}} ({{Langx|ar|هرس}}) 'to pound, to break into pieces', referring to pounding chilis,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Jose|date=2016-07-22|title=The Story of Harissa|url=https://www1.belazu.com/story/harissa/|access-date=2021-02-08|website=Belazu Ingredient Company|language=en-US|archive-date=2021-02-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210209005402/https://www1.belazu.com/story/harissa/|url-status=dead}}</ref> a tool traditionally used to make the paste in the Maghreb is called {{ill|Mehraz|fr|Mehraz}},<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-09-17 |title=Le Mehres, un outil de grand-mère qui n'a jamais perdu son charme |url=https://tunisie.co/article/9419/gastronomie/cuisine/mehras-504800 |access-date=2023-09-17 |website=tunisie.co |language=en-US}}</ref> and similar names are used for other pastes in the Maghrebi cuisine, such as "Hrous" which uses the same harissa recipe with a slight difference in the peppers, which are green.

== Consumption and culinary traditions ==

===Algeria===
In Algeria, harissa is commonly added to soups, stews, and couscous.<ref name="Edelstein2010">{{cite book|author=Sari Edelstein|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tl9Pcq25s8AC&pg=PA345|title=Food, Cuisine, and Cultural Competency for Culinary, Hospitality, and Nutrition Professionals|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Publishers|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4496-5968-4|page=345}}</ref> Harissa paste can also be used as a rub for meat<ref>{{cite web|last=Fayed|first=Saad|title=Flank Steak with Harissa|url=http://mideastfood.about.com/od/beef/r/harissaflank.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608075412/http://mideastfood.about.com/od/beef/r/harissaflank.htm|archive-date=2009-06-08|access-date=2009-08-02|publisher=About.com}}]</ref> or [[eggplant]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Baby Eggplant with Harissa and Mint|url=http://www.aubergines.org/recipes.php?eggplant=2672|access-date=2009-08-02|publisher=Ashbury's Aubergines}}</ref> Another significant producer is Algeria's [[Annaba Province]],<ref name="Group2008">{{cite book|author=Oxford Business Group|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zPz9FHXJVLUC&pg=PA230|title=The Report: Algeria 2008|publisher=Oxford Business Group|year=2008|isbn=978-1-902339-09-2|page=230}}</ref> which is also a significant consumer.<ref name="Albala2011">{{cite book|author=Ken Albala|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NTo6c_PJWRgC&pg=PA7|title=Food Cultures of the World Encyclopedia|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2011|isbn=978-0-313-37626-9|page=7}}</ref> According to cookbook author [[Martha Rose Shulman]], premade harissa tastes rather different from that which is  served in Tunisian and [[expatriate]] restaurants.

===Israel and Libya===
In [[Israel]], harissa is a common topping for ''[[sabich]]''<ref name="Hughes2013">{{cite book|author=Jane Hughes|title=The Adventurous Vegetarian: Around the World in 30 Meals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E8r0AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA182|year=2013|publisher=New Internationalist Publications, Limited |isbn=978-1-78026-124-9 |page=182}}</ref> and ''[[shawarma]]''.

Filfel chuma ({{langx|he|פלפלצ'ומה}}{{ltr}}), also spelled pilpelshuma, literally "pepper garlic", is the typical [[chili sauce]] of [[Israeli cuisine#Sauces and condiments|Libyan Jewish cuisine]] which is very similar to harissa.<ref name="gur">Gur, Jana; (et al.)

===Morocco===
[[Moroccan cuisine]] has also adopted harissa, and some Moroccans use it as a side condiment for [[tagine]]s, or sometimes mixed into dishes. Moroccans tend to have a preference for less seasoned harissa as it allows them to incorporate it into dishes of different flavor profiles.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Benkabbou |first=Nargisse |date=2016-07-12 |title=Harissa |url=https://www.mymoroccanfood.com/home/harissa |access-date=2024-03-11 |website=My Moroccan Food |language=en-GB}}</ref>

=== Tunisia ===
Recipes for harissa vary according to the household and region.  Variations can include the addition of [[fermentation|fermented]] onions or lemon juice. Prepared harissa is sold in jars, cans, bottles and tubes.
