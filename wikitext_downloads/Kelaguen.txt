'''''Kelaguen''''' is a [[Chamorros|Chamorro]] dish from the [[Mariana Islands]] eaten as a side dish or as a main course.  Similar to [[ceviche]], a pickling marinade of [[lemon juice]], fresh [[coconut]], [[scallion|green onions]], salt and spicy [[hot pepper]]s or ''donni' '' is used to marinate cooked [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], raw [[Shrimp (food)|shrimp]], [[Fish (food)|fish]] or [[beef meat]]/[[Liver (food)|liver]].  With the exception of the cooked chicken, the acids in the marinade "cook" the raw shrimp, fish or beef instead of heat.  It is served cold or at room temperature and eaten as is, over [[rice]], or wrapped in a warm corn or flour tortilla (or the Chamorro version, ''titiyas'').<ref name="annie">{{cite web|url=http://www.annieschamorrokitchen.com/chicken-kelaguen-flour-titiyas/|title=Chicken Kelaguen & Flour Titiyas|date=29 July 2013|publisher=Annie's Chamorro Kitchen|accessdate=16 January 2017|archive-date=26 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226222120/http://www.annieschamorrokitchen.com/chicken-kelaguen-flour-titiyas/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="jw">{{cite web|url=http://justwandering.org/2011/destination/guam/exploring-chamorro-cuisine/|title=Exploring Chamorro Cuisine|date=20 June 2011|publisher=Just Wandering|accessdate=16 January 2017|archive-date=8 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608190616/http://justwandering.org/2011/destination/guam/exploring-chamorro-cuisine/|url-status=live}}</ref>

''Kelaguen'' is derived from the [[Philippines|Filipino]] ''[[kilawin]]''. It was introduced by Filipino settlers when the Marianas and the Philippines were both part of the [[Spanish East Indies]]. ''Kelaguen'', however, has diverged in that it also incorporates influences from [[Latin America]], like the use of tortillas.<ref name="annie"/><ref name="jw"/>
