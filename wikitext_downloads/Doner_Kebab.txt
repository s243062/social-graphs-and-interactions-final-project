The sliced meat of a doner kebab may be served on a plate with various accompaniments, stuffed into a [[pita]] or other type of bread as a sandwich, or wrapped in a thin [[flatbread]] such as [[lavash]] or [[filo]], known as a ''[[dürüm]]'' (literally meaning ''roll'' or ''wrap'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]).

== Etymology ==
In the English name "{{Linktext|doner kebab}}", the word ''doner'' is [[Loanword|borrowed]] from the Turkish {{lang|tr|döner kebap}}, with the Turkish letter ''[[ö]]'' usually [[anglicized]] as "o",<ref name="Collins doner kebab">{{Cite web |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/doner-kebab |title=Doner kebab definition and meaning |website=[[Collins English Dictionary]] | access-date=21 January 2018}}</ref> though "döner kebab" is an alternative spelling in English.<ref name="OED doner kebab">{{cite OED2|doner kebab}}</ref> The word ''{{Linktext|kebab}}'' is used, which comes to English from the {{langx|ar|كَبَاب}} ({{Lang|ar-latn|kabāb}}), partly through [[Urdu]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]; it may refer to a number of different [[kebab]] dishes made with roasted or grilled meat. Although ''kebab'' has been used in English since the late 17th century, ''doner/döner kebab'' is known only from the mid-20th century or later.<ref name="OED doner kebab" /> The Turkish word ''{{Linktext|döner}}'' comes from {{Lang|tr|dönmek}} ({{Gloss|to turn, to rotate}}), so the Turkish name {{lang|tr|döner kebap}} literally means {{Gloss|rotating roast}}.<ref name="Heine2004">{{cite book |author=Peter Heine |title=Food culture in the Near East, Middle East, and North Africa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1jE5k5qeKbgC&pg=PA91 |access-date=5 March 2011 |year=2004 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-313-32956-2 |page=91}}</ref> In [[German language|German]], it is spelled {{Lang|de|Döner Kebab}}; the sandwich is often called {{Lang|de|ein Döner}}.

In [[Greek language|Greek]], it was originally called ''döner'' ({{langx|el|ντονέρ}}) but later came to be known as ''[[gyros]]'', from {{lang|el|γύρος}} ({{Gloss|turn}}), a [[calque]] of the Turkish name.<ref>[[Aglaia Kremezi]], "What's in a Dish's Name", "Food and Language", ''Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery'', 2009, {{ISBN|1-903018-79-X}}</ref> The Arabic name {{lang|ar|شاورما}} ({{Lang|ar-latn|shāwarmā}}) derives from another Turkish word, ''{{lang|tr|çevirme}}'', also meaning {{Gloss|turning}}.

* ''[[Dürüm]]'', wrapped in a thin [[Lavash|lavaş]] that is sometimes also grilled after being rolled, to make it crispier. It has two main variants in mainland Turkey:
** {{Lang|tr|Soslu dürüm}} ''or SSK (''{{Lang|tr|sos, soğan, kaşar}}; {{Gloss|sauce, onion, cheese}}) (specialty of [[Ankara]], contains İskender kebap sauce, making it juicier)
** {{Lang|tr|Kaşarlı dürüm döner}} (speciality of [[Istanbul]], grated [[kaşar]] cheese is put in the wrap which is then toasted to melt the cheese and crisp up the lavaş)
* {{Lang|tr|Tombik}} or {{Lang|tr|gobit}} (literally {{Gloss|the chubby}}, doner in a bun-shaped pita, with crispy crust and soft inside and generally less meat than a [[dürüm]])
* {{Lang|tr|Ekmekarası}} ({{Gloss|between bread}}, generally the most filling version, consisting of a whole (or a half) regular Turkish bread filled with doner)

==== Vietnam ====
[[File: Doner Kebap in Hanoi.jpg |thumb|upright|A döner street food cart in Hanoi, Vietnam]]
Doner kebab is increasingly becoming popular in [[Vietnam]], mostly because of Vietnamese who used to live in Germany and introduced it to their homeland. Throughout [[Hanoi]] and [[Ho Chi Minh City]] many doner kebab stalls can be found. [[Bánh mỳ]] Döner Kebab, the Vietnamese version of the doner kebab, has some fundamental differences with the original doner kebab. First of all, pork is used instead of beef and lamb.

Doner kebab shops can be found in all cities across [[Austria]].

==== Belgium ====
In Belgium, the first doner kebabs were already served in the 1970s, brought by immigrants to the country. In the mining region, mainly beef or variants with pieces of chicken was used for the doner kebab. Doner kebabs with mutton and lamb were more likely to be found in other regions of Belgium.{{citation needed|date=July 2024}}

==== Finland ====
[[File:Döner kebab in Helsinki.jpg|thumb|A plate of döner kebab in [[Kamppi]], Helsinki]]
In Finland, doner kebabs gained popularity after the 90s, when Turkish and other Middle-Eastern immigrants started to arrive in the country in considerable numbers, opening restaurants and importing their traditional dishes. Kebabs are generally seen as fast food, often served by late-night [[pizzeria]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pernionkebab.fi/skanssi-kebab/ |title=A kebab restaurant in the "Skanssi" shopping centre|publisher=pernionkebab.fi |language=fi |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016124425/http://www.pernionkebab.fi/skanssi-kebab/ |archive-date=16 October 2009 }}</ref>

Tarkan Taşyumruk, president of the Association of Turkish Döner Producers in Europe (ATDID), provided information in 2010 that, every day, more than 400 tonnes of doner kebab meat is produced in Germany by around 350 firms. At the same ATDID fair, Taşyumruk stated: "Annual sales in Germany amount to €2.5&nbsp;billion. That shows we are one of the biggest fast-foods in Germany."
