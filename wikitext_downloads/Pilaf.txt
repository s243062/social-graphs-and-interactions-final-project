==Etymology==
According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' Online Edition's summary, the [[English language|English]] word ''pilaf'', which the OED, refers to the version with spelling "pilau," is a borrowing partly from [[Persian language|Persian]], partly from [[Hindi]], and partly also from [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]. In more detail, the English pilau, of first use 1609 CE, has come from Persian pulaw (16th cent. as palāv), in turn from [[Hindi]] pulāv dish of rice and meat, from [[Sanskrit]] pulāka ball of rice, probably from [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] (cf [[Tamil language|Tamil]] puḷukku (adjective) simmered, (noun) boiled or parboiled food, puḷukkal cooked rice); probably partly via [[French language|French]] pilau (1654; 1680 as pilaw; 1833 as pilaf), [[Italian language|Italian]] pilao (1542).<ref>{{cite OED|pilau (n)|1467848783}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Arroz enjoyado - Morasa Poló.JPG|thumb|left|Persian Pollo]]
Although the cultivation of rice had spread much earlier from [[India]] to [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[West Asia]], it was at the time of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] that methods of cooking rice which approximate modern styles of cooking pilaf at first spread through a vast territory from [[Spain]] to [[Afghanistan]], and eventually to a wider world.

According to author [[K. T. Achaya]], the Indian epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'' mentions an instance of rice and meat cooked together. Also, according to Achaya, "pulao" or "pallao" is used to refer to a rice dish in ancient Sanskrit works such as the ''[[Yājñavalkya Smṛti]]''.<ref name="KTAchaya1994">{{cite book |author=[[K. T.

The word itself is medieval Farsi, and the dish may have been created in the early sixteenth century at the Safavid court in Persia.  ... Although dishes combining rice, meat and spices were prepared in ancient times, the technique of first sautéing the rice in ghee and then cooking it slowly to keep the grains separate probably came later with the Mughals."</ref><ref>{{citation|last=Perry|first=Charles|title=Annual Cookbook Issue: Book Review: An Armchair Guide to the Indian Table: Indian Food: A Historical Companion By K.

This is a dangerous practice, particularly in India, because certain Indian scholars like to claim that everything in the world originated in India a long time ago. ... Achaya even invents one or two myths of his own. He says there is evidence that south Indians were making pilaf 2,000 years ago, but if you look up the book he footnotes, you find that the Old Tamil word pulavu had nothing to do with pilaf.

Similarly [[Alexander the Great]] and his army, many centuries earlier, in the 4th century BCE, have been reported to have been so impressed with the Eastern Iranian [[Bactria]]n and [[Sogdia]]n ''pilavs'' that his soldiers brought the recipes back to [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] when they returned.<ref name=nabhan>{{cite book|last=Nabhan|first=Gary Paul|title=Cumin, Camels, and Caravans: A Spice Odyssey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e-glDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA135|publisher=University of California Press|date=2014|isbn=9780520267206}}</ref> Similar stories exist of Alexander bringing pilaf to the ancient Persian [[Samarkand]]; however, they are considered apocryphal by art historian [[John Boardman (art historian)|John Boardman]].{{Sfn|Boardman|2019|p=102}} Similarly, it has been reported that pilaf was consumed in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and in the [[Republic of Venice]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Παναγιωτάκης |first=Νικόλαος |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D4dXAAAAMAAJ |title=Ἄνθη χαρίτων: μελετήματα ἑόρτια συγγραφέντα ὑπὸ τῶν ὑποτρόφων τοῦ Ἑλληνικοῦ ἰνστιτούτου βυζαντινῶν καὶ μεταβυζαντινῶν σπουδῶν τῆς Βενετίας... |date=1998 |publisher=[[Hellenic Institute of Byzantine and Post-Byzantine Studies in Venice]] |isbn=978-960-7743-01-5 |pages=72 |language=el |access-date=2023-04-12  |archive-date=2023-08-27  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230827182811/https://books.google.com/books?id=D4dXAAAAMAAJ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The earliest documented recipe for pilaf comes from the tenth-century [[Persian people|Persian]] scholar [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sīnā), who in his books on medical sciences dedicated a whole section to preparing various dishes, including several types of pilaf. In doing so, he described the advantages and disadvantages of every item used for preparing the dish. Accordingly, Persians consider Avicenna to be the "father" of modern pilaf.<ref name=nabhan /> 

Thirteenth-century texts describe the consistency of pilaf that the grains should be plump and somewhat firm to resemble peppercorns with no mushiness, and each grain should be separate with no clumping.<ref name="guardian">{{cite web|title=How to cook perfect pilaf|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/sep/27/how-to-cook-perfect-pilaf|work=The Guardian|date=2012-09-26|access-date=2019-02-13 |archive-date=2023-03-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230307094944/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/sep/27/how-to-cook-perfect-pilaf|url-status=live}}</ref>

Another primary source for pilaf dishes comes from the 17th-century Iranian philosopher [[Molla Sadra]].<ref name=algar>{{cite book|last=Algat |first=Ayla |title=Classical Turkish Cooking: Traditional Turkish Food for the America |publisher=HarperCollins |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gn49svh2_KUC&pg=PT13|isbn=9780062039118 |date=2013-07-30 }}</ref>

Persian Pilau became the standard fare in West Asia and [[Transcaucasia]] over the years.

During the period of the [[Soviet Union]], the Central Asian versions of the dish spread throughout all Soviet republics, becoming a part of the common [[Soviet cuisine]].

==Preparation==
Some cooks prefer to use [[basmati]] rice because it is easier to prepare a pilaf where the grains stay "light, fluffy and separate" with this type of rice. However, other types of long-grain rice are also used. The rice is rinsed thoroughly before use to remove the surface starch. Pilaf can be cooked in water or stock. Common additions include fried onions and fragrant spices like [[cardamom]], [[bay leaves]] and [[cinnamon]].<ref name=guardian />

Pilaf is usually made with meat or vegetables, but it can also be made plain which is called ''sade pilav'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], ''chelo'' in [[Persian language|Persian]] and ''ruzz mufalfal'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]].{{sfn|Davidson|2014|p=624}} Persian pilaf uses [[saffron]] which gives Persian rice its unique yellow color and taste. Pilaf is often made by adding the rice to hot fat and stirring briefly before adding the cooking liquid. The fat used varies from recipe to recipe. Cooking methods vary with respect to details such as pre-soaking the rice and steaming after boiling.<ref name=guardian />

==Local varieties==
There are thousands of variations of pilaf made with rice or other grains like [[bulgur]].<ref name=guardian />Some include different combinations of meats, fruits or vegetables, while others are simple and served plain.<ref name=guardian /> 

[[Central Asian cuisine|Central Asian]], [[South Asian cuisine|South Asian]], [[Iranian cuisine|Iranian]] and [[Caribbean cuisine]] are some with distinctive styles of making pilaf.<ref name="perry">{{cite web|last=Perry|first=Charles|title=Rice Pilaf: Ingredients, Texture Varies|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1994-04-28-9404250390-story.html|work=Sun Sentinel|date=1992-04-28|access-date=2019-02-13 |archive-date=2019-02-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190213124108/https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1994-04-28-9404250390-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Bukhari Meal - Pilaf.jpg|thumb|Bukhari (pilaf) meal in Saudi Arabia]]

In [[Afghan cuisine]], ''[[Kabuli palaw]]'' ({{langx|fa|کابلی پلو}}) is made by cooking [[basmati]] with mutton, lamb, beef or chicken, and oil. Kabuli palaw is cooked in large shallow and thick dishes. Fried sliced [[carrot]]s and [[raisin]]s are added. Chopped nuts like [[pistachio]]s, [[walnut]]s, or [[almond]]s may be added as well. The meat is covered by the rice or buried in the middle of the dish. Kabuli palaw rice with carrots and raisins is very popular in [[Saudi Arabia]], where it is known as ''roz Bukhari'' ({{langx|ar|رز بخاري}}), meaning '[[Emirate of Bukhara|Bukhara]]n rice'.

In [[Bangladesh]], ''polao'' ({{lang|bn|পোলাও}}), is a popular ceremonial dish cooked only with aromatic rice. Bangladesh cultivates many varieties of aromatic rice, which can be found only in this country and some surrounding Indian states with predominantly Bengali populations. Historically, there were many varieties of aromatic rice. These included short-grain rice with buttery and other fragrances depending on the variety. Over a long span of time, many recipes were lost and then reinvented.

Since the 1970s in Bangladesh ''pulao'' has referred to aromatic rice ({{lang|bn|বাসন্তী পোলাও}}) ''Bashonti polao'', first fried either in oil or clarified butter with onions, fresh ginger and whole aromatic spices such as cardamom, cinnamon, black pepper, and more, depending on each household and region. This is then cooked in stock or water, first boiled and then steamed. It is finished off with a bit more clarified butter and fragrant essences such as rose water or kewra water. For presentation, beresta (fried onions) are sprinkled on top. Chicken ''pulao'', (''morog pulao'') is a traditional ceremonial dish among the Bangladeshi Muslim community. There are several different types of ''morog pulao'' found only in particular regions or communities.

In Sylhet and Chittagong, a popular ceremonial dish called ''[[akhni]] polao''. ''Aqni'' being the rich stock in which mutton is cooked and then used to cook the rice. Another very spicy ''Polao'' dish very popular and unique to Bangladesh is called ''Tehari''. It is very different in taste to the ''tahris'' found in some parts of neighboring India. They are most popularly eaten with beef and ''chevon'' (goat meat) but are also paired with chicken.<ref name="Long2015">{{cite book |last1=Long |first1=Lucy M. |title=Ethnic American Food Today: A Cultural Encyclopedia |year=2015 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1-4422-2731-6 |page=52 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DBzYCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA52 |access-date=2022-07-22  |archive-date=2022-07-22  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220722200740/https://books.google.com/books?id=DBzYCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA52 |url-status=live }}</ref> Young small potatoes, mustard oil (which is alternated with clarified butter or oil depending on individual taste), and a unique spice blend found in ''teharis'' distinguish them from other meat ''polaos''. The most famous ''tehari'' in the capital city of [[Dhaka]] is called ''[[Hajir biryani]]''. Although here the name ''biryani'' is a misnomer, in usage among the urban young population it differentiates the popular dish mutton ''biryanis'' (goat meat).

=== Brazil ===
A significantly modified version of the recipe, often seen as influenced by what is called {{lang|pt|arroz pilau}} there, is known in [[Brazilian cuisine|Brazil]] as {{lang|pt|arroz de frango desfiado}} or {{lang|pt|risoto de frango}} ({{IPA|pt|ɐˈʁoz dʒi ˈfɾɐ̃ɡu dʒisfiˈadu|lang}}, "shredded chicken rice"; {{IPA|pt|ʁiˈzotu|}}, "chicken [[risotto]]"). Rice lightly [[Sofrito|fried]] (and optionally seasoned), salted and cooked until soft (but neither soupy nor sticky) in either water or chicken stock is added to chicken stock, onions and sometimes cubed bell peppers (cooked in the stock), shredded chicken breast, green peas, tomato sauce, [[soy sauce|shoyu]], and optionally vegetables (e.g. canned sweet corn, cooked carrot cubes, courgette cubes, [[broccolini]] flowers, chopped broccoli or broccolini stalks or leaves fried in garlic seasoning) or herbs (e.g., mint, like in {{lang|pt|[[Canja de galinha|canja]]}}) to form a distantly [[risotto]]-like dish – but it is generally fluffy (depending on the texture of the rice being added), as generally, once all ingredients are mixed, it is not left to cook longer than five minutes. In the case shredded chicken breast is not added, with the rice being instead served alongside chicken and {{lang|fr|sauce suprême}}, it is known as {{lang|pt|arroz suprême de frango}} ({{IPA|pt|ɐˈʁos suˈpɾẽm(i) dʒi ˈfɾɐ̃ɡu|lang}}, "chicken [[supreme (cookery)|supreme]] rice").

In the [[Eastern Caribbean]] and other Caribbean territories there are variations of ''[[pelau]]'' which include a wide range of ingredients such as [[pigeon pea]]s, [[Pea|green peas]], [[green bean]]s, corn, carrots, pumpkin, and meat such as beef or chicken, or cured pig tail.  The seasoned meat is usually cooked in a stew, with the rice and other vegetables added afterwards. Coconut milk and spices are also key additions in some islands.

[[Trinidad]] is recognized for its ''pelau'', a layered rice with meats and vegetables. It is a mix of traditional [[African cuisine]] and "New World" ingredients like [[ketchup]]. The process of browning the meat (usually chicken, but also stew beef or lamb) in [[sugar]] is an African technique.<ref name=ganeshram>{{cite book|last=Ganeshram|first=Ramin|title=Sweet Hands: Island Cooking from Trinidad & Tobago|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zNA8RWWB3gwC|publisher=Hippocrene Books|isbn=9780781811255|date=2005-10-31}}</ref>

A limited degree of steaming is commonly achieved by covering the pot. It is usually cooked in a ''[[Kazon (cookware)|kazon]]'' (or ''deghi'') over an open fire.

Plov is usually simply spiced with salt, [[black pepper|peppercorns]], and [[cumin]], but [[coriander]], [[Barberry|barberries]], [[Peppercorn|red pepper]], or [[Pot marigold|marigold]] may be added according to regional variation or the chef's preference. Heads of garlic and chickpeas are sometimes buried into the rice during cooking.

Although often prepared at home, plov is made on special occasions by an ''oshpaz'' or ''ashpoz'' (osh/ash master chef), who cooks it over an open flame, sometimes serving up to 1,000 people from a single cauldron on holidays or occasions such as weddings. ''Oshi nahor'', or "morning palov", is served in the early morning (between 6 and 9 am) to large gatherings of guests, typically as part of an ongoing wedding celebration.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Perfect Plov Recipe|url=https://nargiscafe.com/perfect_plov_recipe/|website=nargiscafe.com|access-date=2020-05-24|archive-date=2021-02-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210227060432/https://nargiscafe.com/perfect_plov_recipe/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In [[Greek cuisine]], ''piláfi'' (πιλάφι) is fluffy and soft, but neither soupy nor sticky, rice that has been boiled in a meat stock or [[Bouillon cube|bouillon broth]]. In Northern Greece, it is considered improper to prepare ''piláfi'' on a stovetop; the pot is properly placed in the oven.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}} ''Gamopílafo'' ("wedding pilaf") is the prized pilaf served traditionally at weddings and major celebrations in [[Crete]]: rice is boiled in lamb or goat broth, then finished with [[lemon]] juice. Although it bears the name, ''Gamopílafo'' is not a pilaf but rather a kind of [[risotto]], with a creamy and not fluffy texture.

''Pulao'' is usually a mixture of  [[rice]] with vegetables, usually [[pea]]s, [[potato]]es, [[green bean]]s, [[carrot]]s and sometimes includes any one kind of meat like [[chicken]], [[fish]], [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[goat]], [[pork]] or [[prawn]]s. A typical [[Bengali cuisine|Bengali]] style pulao is prepared using vegetarian ingredients like [[Long-grain rice|Long grain rice]] or [[aromatic rice]], [[cashewnut]], [[raisin]], [[ghee]] and various spices like [[nutmeg]], [[bay leaf]], [[cinnamon]], [[cardamom]], [[cumin]], [[clove]] and [[Mace (spice)|mace]]. There are also a few very elaborate ''pulaos'' with Persian names like ''hazar pasand'' ("a thousand delights").{{sfn|Davidson|2014|p=}} It is usually served on special occasions and weddings, though it is not uncommon to eat it for a regular lunch or dinner meal.

=== Iran ===
[[File:Loobia Polo.jpg|thumb|right|''Lubia polo'', 'Persian rice with green beans' in Iran]]
[[Persian cuisine|Persian]] culinary terms referring to [[rice]] preparation are numerous and ancient and have influenced and found their way into the neighbouring languages: ''polow'' (from which the word "pilaf" is derived around the world; rice cooked in broth while the grains remain separate, straining the half cooked rice before adding the broth and then "brewing"), ''chelow'' (white rice with separate grains), ''[[kateh]]'' (sticky rice) and ''[[tahchin]]'' (slow cooked rice, vegetables, and meat cooked in a specially designed dish). One of the many unique ingredients used in Persian rice is saffron. There are a wide variety of Persian rice dishes (upto 100 dishes) with vegetables and herbs which are very popular among Iranians.  

There are four primary methods of cooking rice in Iran:
* ''Chelow'': rice that is carefully prepared through soaking and [[parboiling]], at which point the water is drained and the rice is steamed. This method results in an exceptionally fluffy rice with the grains separated and not sticky; it also results in a golden rice crust at the bottom of the pot called ''[[tahdig]]'' (literally "bottom of the pot").
* ''Polow'': rice that is cooked exactly the same as ''chelo'', with the exception that after draining the rice, other ingredients are layered with the rice, and they are then steamed together.
* ''Kateh'': rice that is boiled until the water is absorbed. This is the traditional dish of Northern Iran.
* ''Dami:'' Cooked almost the same as ''kateh'', except that the heat is reduced just before boiling and a towel is placed between the lid and the pot to prevent steam from escaping. ''Dami'' literally means "simmered".

=== Japan ===
Japanese style Pilaf (ピラフ) is commonly eaten with Japanese school lunch, or kyūshoku (給食). The most common pilaf enjoyed with Japanese school lunch is a corn pilaf.

=== Kenya ===
In [[Kenya]] pilau is mostly eaten in coastal regions. The spices are similar to Indian varieties. Potatoes are typically added to the masala and the dish can be eaten with meat, fish or meatless. It is often served with a side of [[kachumbari]].

In [[Pakistan]], ''pulao'' ({{lang|ur|{{Nastaliq|پلاؤ}}}}), also romanized as ''{{lang|ur-latn|pulāv}}''''',''' is a popular dish made with fragrant [[basmati]] rice cooked in a seasoned meat or bone broth. Typically non-spicy, it features tender pieces of meat, such as chicken, lamb, or beef, though vegetarian variations are also popular. As with Afghan cuisine, ''[[Kabuli palaw|Kabuli pulav]]'' is a staple dish in Pakistan, especially in the western regions. This variation of pulav is often adorned with sliced carrots, almonds, and raisins fried in a sweet syrup, adding a unique touch of sweetness and texture to the dish.
[[Bannu|Bannu Beef Pulao]], also known as Bannu Gosht Pulao, is a traditional and popular variation of pulav recipe hailing from the [[Bannu District|Bannu district]] of the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province in [[Pakistan]]. The dish is made with beef, basmati rice, and a blend of local spices, resulting in a flavor profile characteristic of the region. The beef is first cooked in a separate preparation known as [[Yahni|Beef Yakhni]], made using a combination of salt, ginger, garlic, onions, and garam masala. This broth enhances the flavor and ensures the meat is tender. The rice is then combined with the cooked beef, allowing the flavors to meld together. This delicacy is often served during special occasions and family dinners and is a [[Staple food|staple]] of the [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] culinary tradition.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Home Bannu Beef Pulao Chuburji |url=https://www.bannubeefpulaoturabfoods.pk/chuburji/home |access-date=2023-01-22 |website=www.bannubeefpulaoturabfoods.pk |archive-date=2023-01-22  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230122181708/https://www.bannubeefpulaoturabfoods.pk/chuburji/home |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Malang Jan Bannu Beef Pulao |url=http://niftyfoodz.com/recipe/malang-jan-bannu-beef-pulao |access-date=2023-01-22 |website=niftyfoodz.com |language=en |archive-date=2023-01-22  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230122181719/https://niftyfoodz.com/recipe/malang-jan-bannu-beef-pulao |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Romania===
Romanian style ''pilaf'' is often more watery in consistency, more akin to [[congee]], and uses chicken breast meat along with chopped red peppers, onion, and carrot.

===Levant===
Traditional Levantine cooking includes a variety of Pilaf known as "[[Maqlubeh]]", known across the countries of the Eastern Mediterranean. The rice pilaf which is traditionally cooked with meat, eggplant, tomatoes, potatoes, and cauliflower also has a fish variety known as "Sayyadiyeh", or the Fishermen's Dish.

===Turkey===
[[File:Pilav.JPG|thumb|right|Typical Turkish pilav. Rice with [[orzo (pasta)|orzo]].]]
Historically, mutton stock was the most common cooking liquid for Turkish pilavs.

Turkish cuisine contains many different pilav types. Some of these variations are ''pirinç'' (rice) pilav, ''[[bulgur]]'' pilav, and ''arpa şehriye'' ([[orzo]]) pilav. Using mainly these three types, Turkish people make many dishes such as ''[[perdeli pilav]]'', and ''etli pilav'' (rice cooked with cubed beef). Unlike Chinese rice, if Turkish rice is sticky, it is considered unsuccessful. To make the best rice according to Turkish people, one must rinse the rice, cook in butter, then add the water and let it sit until it soaks all the water. This results in a pilaf that is not sticky and every single rice grain falls off of the spoon separately.

===Baltics===
Lithuanian pilaf is often referred to as ''plovas''. It tends to consist of rice and vegetables; depending on the region the vegetables can be tomatoes, carrots, cabbage, and/or mushrooms. It often contains chicken pieces or cut-up pieces of pork, usually the meat around the neck or the stomach; seasonings can be heavy or light, and some ''plovas'' might be made with rice that is very soft, unlike other variants.

Latvian pilaf is often referred to as ''plovs'' or ''plov''. It tends to contain the same ingredients as the Lithuanian ''plovas'' and can vary from county to county.

The Greek Orthodox [[Pontic Greeks|Pontian]] minority had their own methods of preparing pilav.<ref>{{cite web |title=Five Pontian recipes for Lent |url=https://www.pontosnews.gr/293024/syntages/pente-pontiakes-syntages-gia-to-sarak/ |work=Pontos News |language=Greek |date=March 2, 2014 |access-date=2021-04-10  |archive-date=2023-03-07  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230307095019/https://www.pontosnews.gr/293024/syntages/pente-pontiakes-syntages-gia-to-sarak/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Voutira |first1=Eftihia |title=Genealogies across the cold war divide: The case of the Pontic Greeks from the former Soviet Union and their 'affinal repatriation' |journal=Ethnography |date=2020 |url=https://www.academia.edu/44724165 |volume=21 |issue=3 |page=360 |doi=10.1177/1466138120939589 |s2cid=221040916 |access-date=2021-04-10  |archive-date=2022-09-06  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220906054108/https://www.academia.edu/44724165 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Sinope Pilaf |work=Pontos News |language=Greek |date=October 7, 2012 |url=https://www.pontosnews.gr/260394/syntages/pilafi-sinopis/ |access-date=2021-04-10  |archive-date=2023-03-07  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230307095029/https://www.pontosnews.gr/260394/syntages/pilafi-sinopis/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Pontians along the Black Sea coast might make pilav with anchovies (called {{lang|pnt|hapsipilavon}}) or mussels (called {{lang|pnt|mythopilavon}}).<ref>{{cite web |title=Mythopilavon: the Pontian mussel pilav |work=Pontos News |language=Greek |date=February 15, 2013 |url=https://www.pontosnews.gr/272040/syntages/mythopilavon-to-pontiako-mydopilafo/ |access-date=2021-04-10  |archive-date=2023-03-07  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230307095028/https://www.pontosnews.gr/272040/syntages/mythopilavon-to-pontiako-mydopilafo/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Hapsipilavon, the Pontian pilaf with fish |work=Pontos News |language=Greek |date=February 19, 2021 |url=https://www.pontosnews.gr/640286/syntages/chapsopilavon-pontiako-pilafi-ta-psaria/ |access-date=2021-04-10  |archive-date=2023-03-07  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230307095028/https://www.pontosnews.gr/640286/syntages/chapsopilavon-pontiako-pilafi-ta-psaria/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Other varieties of Pontian pilav could include chicken,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Charmei |first1=Amber |title=Homecoming, Greek-Style |work=Greece Is |date=2018 |url=https://www.greece-is.com/article/homecoming-greek-style/ |access-date=2021-04-10  |archive-date=2021-04-10  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210410032246/https://www.greece-is.com/article/homecoming-greek-style/ |url-status=live }}</ref> lamb, and vegetables.
