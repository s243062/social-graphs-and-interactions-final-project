'''Soused herring''' is raw [[Herring as food|herring]] soaked in a mild [[Preservative|preserving liquid]]. It can be raw herring in a mild vinegar pickle or Dutch [[brining|brined]] herring.  As well as vinegar, the [[marinade]] might contain cider, wine or tea, sugar, herbs (usually [[bay leaf]]), spices (usually [[mace (spice)|mace]]), and chopped onion.

The word 'soused' can also describe a marinated herring that has been cooked.<ref>{{cite web|title=Saffron Orange Soused Mackerel Salad|url=http://www.britishlarder.co.uk/saffron-orange-soused-mackerel-salad|publisher=The British Larder|accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref> The herring is usually baked in the (vinegar) marinade (but can be fried and then soaked in the marinade). It is served cold. This is usual in Scotland, Wales and Ireland.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Davidson |first1=Alan |title=North Atlantic Seafood |date=October 1988 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=0140468153|pages=440, 463}}</ref>

The soused herring (''maatjesharing'' or just ''maatjes'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], or ''Matjes/matjes'' in [[German language|German]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] respectively) is an especially mild salt herring, which is made from immature herrings. The herrings are ripened for a couple of days in oak barrels in a salty solution, or [[brine]]. The pancreatic [[enzymes]] which support the ripening make this version of salt herring especially mild and soft. Raw herring pickled in vinegar are called [[rollmop]]s.

As of 2015, within the EU, Dutch-made ''Hollandse Nieuwe'', ''Holländischer Matjes'' and ''Hollandse maatjesharing'' have [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|TSG]] Certification<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/quality/door/registeredName.html?denominationId=10050 EU TSG Certification Database Entry] (Accessed November 2015)</ref> and German-produced '''Glückstädter Matjes''', produced in [[Schleswig-Holstein]] has ''PGI'' certification.<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/quality/door/registeredName.html?denominationId=8801 EU PGI Certification Database entry] (Accessed Nov/2015)</ref> A

==History==
This process of preparing herring (known as "[[gibbing]]") was developed in the Middle Ages by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]. Herrings are caught between the end of May and the beginning of July in the [[North Sea]] near [[Denmark]] or [[Norway]], before the breeding season starts. This is because herrings at this time are unusually rich in oils (over 15%) and their [[roe]] and [[milt]] have not started to develop.

The brine used for Dutch soused herring has a much lower salt content and is much milder in taste than the German ''[[Loggermatjes]]''. To protect against infection by [[nematodes]] of the genus [[Anisakis]], [[European Union]] regulations state that fish should be frozen at −20&nbsp;°C for at least 24 hours.<ref>{{cite web|title=REGULATION (EC) No 853/2004 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL: laying down specific hygiene rules for on the hygiene of foodstuffs|date=29 April 2004|at=Chapter III § D § 1|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:139:0055:0205:EN:PDF#page=113}}</ref> In the modern day, soused herrings can therefore be produced throughout the year.

The Dutch newspaper ''[[Algemeen Dagblad]]'' has for more than thirty years organized a competition whereby the quality of soused herring was evaluated.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Gao |first=Fengnan |last2=Gill |first2=Richard |date=2023 |title=A very Dutch scandal |doi=10.1093/jrssig/qmad059 |journal=Significance}}</ref> In 2017, there was a controversy over this competition, as an economist produced two working papers accusing the newspaper of biased testing.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2017 |title=Netherlands fishmongers accuse herring-tasters of erring |work=The Economist |url=https://www.economist.com/europe/2017/11/23/netherlands-fishmongers-accuse-herring-tasters-of-erring |issn=0013-0613}}</ref> As a consequence, the competition was discontinued. Subsequently, statisticians have argued that the economist's claims relied on questionable statistics.<ref name=":0" />

==Preparation==
Through a cut in the throat, the [[gills]] and part of the gullet are removed from the herring, eliminating any bitter taste. The liver and pancreas are left in the fish during the salt-curing process because they release enzymes essential for flavor. The herrings are then placed in the brine for approximately five days, traditionally in [[oak]] casks. They require no further preparation after [[Fillet (cut)|fillet]] and skin removal and can be eaten as a snack with finely sliced raw onion and pickles.

As skin removal requires experience, fillets or double fillets should be attempted first. The soused herrings are silvery outside and pink inside when fresh, and should not be bought if they appear grey and oily.

Whereas salt herrings have a salt content of 20% and must be soaked in water before consumption, soused herrings do not need soaking.

==Serving==

In the Netherlands soused herring is most often served as a snack, most frequently plain, or with a garnish of diced raw onion. Whole herring is often eaten by lifting the herring by its tail and eating it upwards holding it over the mouth.
Soused herring dishes in Northern Germany are traditionally served with potatoes boiled in their skins, French beans, finely sliced fried [[bacon]] and [[onion]]. It is also common in Germany to eat soused herring with sliced raw onion in a bread roll, in a dish called ''[[Fischbrötchen|Matjesbrötchen]]''.

In some regions (e.&nbsp;g. [[Holstein]]), it is served on dark bread with a [[cowberry]] and cream sauce. Soused herring can also be served with cream or [[yogurt]] sauces containing onions and gherkins, or in [[salads]].

In Sweden ''matjessill'' is traditionally served with boiled potatoes, sour cream, chopped chives, crisp bread and [[snaps]]. Boiled eggs are popular together with this dish that is most traditionally served on [[Midsummer]]'s Eve – Finland has a similar custom but ''silli'' is not associated with crisp bread. Nowadays most Swedes and Finns eat herring which comes in cans and are sliced and with added sugar. The Swedish ''matjessill'' is most often more strongly spiced than other varieties.
