Sofrito is blended into a watery or paste consistency. There are many family recipe variations of sofrito.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rivera |first1=Marta |title=Puerto Rican Sofrito- Authentic Culantro Cooking Base |url=https://senseandedibility.com/sofrito-authentic-recipe/ |website=Sense and Edibility |access-date=6 August 2025}}</ref> The sofrito is cooked with the rice, the idea is for the rice to absorb the sofrito for maximum flavor. <ref>{{cite news
