'''Mozzarella'''{{efn|English: {{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|ɒ|t|s|ə|ˈ|r|ɛ|l|ə}} {{respell|MOT|sə|REL|ə}}, {{IPA|it|mottsaˈrɛlla|lang|small=no}}; {{langx|nap|muzzarella}}, {{IPA|nap|muttsaˈrɛllə|pron|small=no}}.}} is a [[Types of cheese#Semi-soft cheese|semi-soft]] non-aged [[cheese]] prepared using the {{lang|it|[[pasta filata]]}} ('stretched-curd') method. It originated in [[southern Italy]].

Varieties of mozzarella are distinguished by the milk used: {{lang|it|mozzarella fior di latte}} when prepared with cow's milk and [[buffalo mozzarella]] ({{lang|it|mozzarella di bufala}} in Italian) when the milk of the [[Italian Mediterranean buffalo|Italian buffalo]] is used.

Mozzarella is used for most types of [[pizza]] and several pasta dishes or served with sliced [[tomato]]es and [[basil]] in [[Caprese salad]].

==Etymology==
{{lang|it|Mozzarella}}, derived from the southern Italian dialects spoken in [[Apulia]], [[Calabria]], [[Campania]], [[Abruzzo]], [[Molise]], [[Basilicata]], [[Lazio]], and [[Marche]], is the diminutive form of {{lang|it|mozza}}, 'cut', or {{lang|it|mozzare}}, 'to cut off', derived from the method of working.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mozzarella |author= Staff |title= Mozzarella |work= Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online |access-date= 1 April 2012 |archive-date= 6 October 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111006191703/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mozzarella |url-status= live }}</ref> The term is first mentioned in 1570, cited in a cookbook by [[Bartolomeo Scappi]], reading "milk cream, fresh butter, ricotta cheese, fresh mozzarella and milk".<ref>{{cite news |first= David |last= Charter |url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/food_and_drink/article3643079.ece |title= Buffalo mozzarella in crisis after pollution fears at Italian farms |work= [[The Times]] |location= London |date= 29 March 2008 |access-date= 1 April 2008 |archive-date= 29 August 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080829150322/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/food_and_drink/article3643079.ece |url-status= dead }}{{subscription required}}</ref> An earlier reference of [[Monsignor]] Alicandri is also often cited as describing mozzarella, which states that in the 12th century the Monastery of San Lorenzo, in [[Capua]], Campania, Alicandri offered pilgrims a piece of bread with {{lang|it|mozza}}.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Alicandri L.|title=Il Mazzone nell'antichità e nei tempi presenti|year=1915|page=88|language=Italian}}</ref>

Fresh mozzarella has been recognised as a [[traditional speciality guaranteed]] (TSG) since 1996 in the [[European Union]].<ref>Regolamento (CE) N. 2527/98 della commissione del 25 novembre 1998 registrando una denominazione - Mozzarella - nell'albo delle attestazioni di specificità.

It is soaked in [[Saline water|salt water]] ([[brine]]) or [[whey]].

In Italy, the cheese is produced nationwide using Italian buffalo's milk under the government's official name {{lang|it|mozzarella di latte di bufala}}, because [[Italian Mediterranean buffalo|Italian buffalo]] are present in all regions. Only selected {{lang|it|[[Buffalo mozzarella|mozzarella di bufala campana]]}} [[Protected designation of origin|PDO]] is a style made from the milk of Italian buffalo raised in designated areas of [[Campania]], [[Lazio]], [[Apulia]], and [[Molise]].

[[File:Bocconcini_gobeirne.jpg|thumb|Bocconcini with a sprig of basil]]
Fresh mozzarella balls are made in multiple sizes for various uses; often the name refers to the size.

A {{lang|it|bocconcino di bufala campana}} PDO is also made, which is simply {{lang|it|mozzarella di bufala campana}} PDO, produced in the egg-sized format.

When twisted to form a plait, mozzarella is called {{lang|it|treccia}}.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Bonetto | first1=C. | last2=Clark | first2=G. | last3=McNaughtan | first3=H. | title=Lonely Planet Southern Italy | publisher=Lonely Planet Global Limited | series=Travel Guide | year=2018 | isbn=978-1-78701-947-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M71TDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT471 | access-date=27 October 2024 | page=PT471}}</ref>

After the curd heals, it is further cut into {{Convert|1|-|1.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} pieces. The curds are stirred and heated to separate the curds from the whey. The whey is then drained from the curds and the curds are placed in a hoop to form a solid mass. The curd mass is left until the pH is at around 5.2–5.5, which is the point when the cheese can be stretched and kneaded to produce a delicate consistency—this process is generally known as {{lang|it|[[pasta filata]]}}. According to the {{lang|it|mozzarella di bufala campana}} trade association, "The cheese-maker kneads it with his hands... until he obtains a smooth, shiny paste, a strand of which he pulls out and lops off, forming individual mozzarella."<ref>{{cite web |author= Staff |url= http://www.mozzarelladibufala.org/allestimento.htm |title= Campana Buffalo's Mozzarella Cheese |publisher= Mozzarella di Bufala Campana Trade Organization |access-date= 8 May 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081017165243/http://www.mozzarelladibufala.org/allestimento.htm |archive-date= 17 October 2008 |url-status= dead }}</ref>

Large quantities of mozzarella are exported internationally.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book |last=Schwartz |first=Arthur |title=Naples at Table: Cooking in Campania |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |year=1998 |isbn=0-06-018261-X |location=New York |pages=[https://archive.org/details/naplesattablecoo0000schw/page/210/ 210]}}</ref>

==Storage==
Due to its high moisture content, it is traditionally served the day it is made,<ref name=":1" /> and food writer Arthur Schwartz describes that a Neapolitan will not eat day-old mozzarella without further processing—frying or baking into a casserole or pasta. Despite this, manufacturers market the cheese as having a week-long [[shelf life]]. As mozzarella is kept, it develops a sour flavour and softens, a process which is slower for larger cheeses.<ref name=":4" />

Within the city of Naples, there is a belief among part of the populace that the best mozzarella has "relaxed"; softened in the hours after being made. Schwartz reports that this does not seem to be believed by Campanians who live in the country, closer to dairy farms where the cheese is produced, where the cheese can be easily purchased while still firm.<ref name=":4" />

Low-moisture mozzarella can be kept refrigerated for up to a month,<ref name=":2" /> although some shredded low-moisture mozzarella is sold with a shelf life of up to six months.<ref name=":3" />

==Recognitions and regulations==
