A '''full breakfast''' or '''fry-up''' is a substantial cooked [[breakfast]] meal often served in Britain and Ireland. Depending on the region, it may also be referred to as a '''full English''',<ref name="full English">{{cite web |title=The full English |url=http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/pork-recipes/the-full-english |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728111930/http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/pork-recipes/the-full-english |archive-date=28 July 2014 |access-date=26 February 2014 |publisher=Jamieoliver.com}}</ref> a '''full Irish''', full '''Scottish''',<ref name="full Scottish">{{cite web |title=Traditional Scottish Food |url=http://www.visitscotland.com/about/food-drink/traditional |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213034050/http://www.visitscotland.com/about/food-drink/traditional |archive-date=13 February 2014 |access-date=26 February 2014 |publisher=Visit Scotland}}</ref> full '''Welsh'''<ref name="walesonline.co.uk">{{cite news |date=25 October 2005 |title=So what is a 'full Welsh breakfast'? |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/what-full-welsh-breakfast-2374227 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502004835/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/what-full-welsh-breakfast-2374227 |archive-date=2 May 2014 |work=Wales Online}}</ref> or '''Ulster fry'''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bell |first=James |date=29 January 2014 |title=How to...

The typical ingredients are [[bacon]], [[Sausage#Britain and Ireland|sausages]], [[egg (food)|eggs]], [[black pudding]], [[tomatoes]], [[edible mushroom|mushrooms]], and [[fried bread]] or [[Toast (food)|toast]] and the meal is often served with tea. [[Baked beans]], [[hash browns]], and coffee (in place of tea) are common contemporary but non-traditional inclusions.

The fried breakfast became popular in Great Britain and Ireland during the [[Victorian era]]; while the term "full breakfast" does not appear, a breakfast of "fried ham and eggs" is in [[Isabella Beeton]]'s ''[[Mrs. Beeton's Book of Household Management|Book of Household Management]]'' (1861).

== History and popularity ==
Many of the ingredients of a full breakfast have long histories, but "large cooked breakfasts do not figure in English life and letters until the 19th century, when they appeared with dramatic suddenness".<ref name="O'Connor">O’Connor, K. (2009). Cuisine, nationality and the making of a national meal: The English breakfast. In Nations and their histories: Constructions and representations (pp. 157-171). London: Palgrave Macmillan UK.</ref> Across the British Isles and Ireland, [[early modern]] breakfasts were often breads served with jams or marmalades, or else forms of [[oatmeal]], [[porridge]] or [[pottage]].<ref name="Anderson">Anderson, H. A. (2013). Breakfast: a history. AltaMira Press.</ref> Eggs and bacon started to appear in breakfasts in the seventeenth century,<ref name="Anderson" /> but they were not the only meats consumed in breakfasts at that time.<ref name="Anderson" /> The rising popularity of breakfast was closely tied to the rise of [[tea (drink)|tea]] as a popular morning drink.<ref name="O'Connor" /> Of note were the lavish breakfasts of the aristocracy, which would centre on local meats and fish from their country estates.<ref name="O'Connor" /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Shaw Nelson |first1=Kay |title=The Gastronomic World of Sir Walter Scott |url=https://electricscotland.com/familytree/frank/scott.htm |publisher=Electric Scotland |access-date=3 August 2023}}</ref>

The fried breakfast became popular in Great Britain and Ireland during the [[Victorian era]]. Cookbooks were important in the fixing of the ingredients of a full breakfast during this time,<ref name="O'Connor" /> and the full breakfast appeared in the best-selling [[Isabella Beeton]]'s ''[[Mrs. Beeton's Book of Household Management|Book of Household Management]]'' (1861). This new full breakfast was a pared-down version of the country breakfasts of the upper class, affordable to the emergent middle classes and able to be prepared and consumed in a shorter time before a day's work.<ref name="O'Connor" /><ref name="Anderson" /><ref name="EBS">{{cite news |title=History Of The Traditional English Breakfast |agency=English breakfast society |url=https://englishbreakfastsociety.com/full-english-breakfast.html |access-date=21 October 2021}}</ref> The full breakfast reached its peak of popularity in [[Edwardian Britain]],<ref name="EBS" /> and despite a decline following the food shortages of World War II,<ref name="O'Connor" /> new technologies of food storage and preparation allowed it to become a staple of the working class in the 1950s.<ref name="EBS" /> Since then the full breakfast has declined in popularity as a daily meal, due to perceived concerns about health and its lengthy preparation compared to convenience-food breakfasts.<ref name="O'Connor" /> However, the meal remains popular as an occasional, celebratory or traditional breakfast.<ref name="O'Connor" /><ref name="EBS" />

It is so popular in Great Britain and Ireland that many [[café]]s and [[pub]]s offer the meal at any time of day as an "all-day breakfast". It is also popular in many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations. The full breakfast is among the most internationally recognised [[British cuisine|British dishes]] along with [[bangers and mash]], [[toad in the hole]], [[shepherd's pie]], [[fish and chips]], [[roast beef]], [[Sunday roast]], [[cream tea]] and the [[Christmas dinner]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Spencer |first=Colin |title=British Food: An Extraordinary Thousand Years of History |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-231-13110-0}}</ref>

As nearly everything is fried in this meal, it is commonly known as a "fry-up". In the UK it is sometimes referred to as a "[[The full monty|Full Monty]]".
