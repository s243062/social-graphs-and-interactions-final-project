The traditional Cornish pasty, which since 2011 has had [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|Protected Geographical Indication]] (PGI) status in Europe,<ref name=L193 /> is filled with [[beef]], sliced or diced potato, [[rutabaga|swede]] (also known as yellow turnip or rutabaga – referred to in Cornwall and other parts of the [[West Country]] as [[turnip]]) and onion, seasoned with salt and pepper, and [[baking|baked]]. Today, the pasty is the food most associated with Cornwall. It is a traditional dish and accounts for 6% of the Cornish food economy. Pasties with many different fillings are made, and some shops specialise in selling pasties.

The origins of the pasty are unclear, though there are many references to them throughout historical documents and fiction. The pasty is now popular worldwide because of the [[Cornish diaspora|spread of Cornish miners]] and sailors from across Cornwall, and variations can be found in Australia, Mexico, the United States, [[Ulster]] and elsewhere.

[[File:Pasty2.jpg|thumb|upright|An old postcard from Cornwall showing a partly eaten pasty]]

Despite the modern pasty's strong association with Cornwall, its origins are unclear. The English word "pasty" derives from Medieval French (O.Fr.

Other early references to pasties include a charter that was granted by [[John, King of England|King John of England]] to the town of [[Great Yarmouth]] in 1208. The town was bound to send to the sheriffs of [[Norwich]] every year ''one hundred herrings, baked in twenty four pasties'', which the sheriffs delivered to the lord of the manor of [[East Carlton]] who then conveyed them to the king.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nuttall|first=P Austin|title=A classical and archæological dictionary of the manners, customs, laws, institutions, arts, etc. of the celebrated nations of antiquity, and of the middle ages|year=1840|location=London|page=555|publisher=Whittaker and Company|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V-gDAAAAQAAJ&dq=Yarmouth+pasties&pg=PA555|access-date=23 March 2023|archive-date=4 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230404115121/https://books.google.com/books?id=V-gDAAAAQAAJ&dq=Yarmouth+pasties&pg=PA555|url-status=live}}</ref> Around the same time, 13th-century [[Historians in England during the Middle Ages|chronicler]] [[Matthew Paris]] wrote of the monks of [[St Albans Cathedral|St Albans Abbey]] "according to their custom, lived upon pasties of flesh-meat".<ref>{{cite book|last=Brayley|first=Edward Wedlake|author-link=Edward Wedlake Brayley|title=The Beauties of England and Wales, Or Delineations, Topographical, Historical and Descriptive|volume=VII (Hertford, Huntingdon and Kent)|publisher=Thomas Maiden|location=London|year=1808|page=40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nd0uAAAAMAAJ&dq=st+alban%27s+abbey+pasties&pg=PA40|access-date=23 March 2023|archive-date=7 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230407152115/https://books.google.com/books?id=nd0uAAAAMAAJ&dq=st+alban%27s+abbey+pasties&pg=PA40|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1465, 5,500 venison pasties were served at the installation feast of [[George Neville (bishop)|George Neville]], archbishop of York and chancellor of England.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopædia Britannica 1823 vol VIII|year=1823|page=585|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JMknAAAAMAAJ&dq=Matthew+Paris+pasty&pg=PA585|publisher=Printed for Archibald Constable and Company|access-date=23 March 2023|archive-date=5 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230405004438/https://books.google.com/books?id=JMknAAAAMAAJ&dq=Matthew+Paris+pasty&pg=PA585|url-status=live}}</ref> The earliest reference for a pasty in [[Devon]] or Cornwall can be found in [[Plymouth]] city records of 1509/10, which describe "Itm for the cooke is labor to make the pasties 10d".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/cornwall/6144460.stm|title=Devon invented the Cornish pasty|publisher=BBC|date=13 November 2006|access-date=21 February 2019|archive-date=4 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200504203005/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/cornwall/6144460.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> They were even eaten by royalty, as a letter from a baker to [[Henry VIII]]'s third wife [[Jane Seymour]] confirms: "...hope this pasty reaches you in better condition than the last one ..."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2001/apr/21/foodanddrink.features31 |title=A short history of ...

In contrast to its earlier place amongst the wealthy, during the 17th and 18th centuries, the pasty became popular with working people in Cornwall and west Devon, where [[Tin#Mining and smelting|tin miner]]s and others adopted it because of its unique shape, forming a complete meal that could be carried easily and eaten without cutlery.<ref>{{cite book | title=Cornish Saints & Sinners | author=Harris, J Henry | year=2009 | publisher=Wildside Press LLC | page=195 | isbn=9781434453679 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZRDxG44Thg4C&pg=PA195}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2460056/The-history-of-the-Cornish-pasty.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2460056/The-history-of-the-Cornish-pasty.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live | title=The History of the Cornish Pasty | access-date=2 March 2011 | author=Devlin, Kate | date=25 July 2008 | newspaper=The Daily Telegraph}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref name="grigson" /> In a mine, the pasty's dense, folded pastry could stay warm for several hours, and if it did get cold, it could easily be warmed on a shovel over a candle.<ref name="context" />

Side-crimped pasties gave rise to the suggestion that the miner might have eaten the pasty holding the thick edge of pastry, which was later discarded, thereby ensuring that dirty fingers (possibly including traces of [[arsenic]]) did not touch the food or mouth.<ref name="DEFRA" /> However, many old photographs show that pasties were wrapped in bags made of paper or [[muslin]] and were eaten from end to end;<ref>{{cite book|last=Mansfield|first=Emma|title=The Little Book of the Pasty|year=2011|publisher=Lovely Little Books|location=Cornwall|isbn=978-1-906771-28-7|page=101}}</ref> according to the earliest Cornish recipe book, published in 1929, this is "the true Cornish way" to eat a pasty.<ref name=CRAM>{{cite book|title=Cornish Recipes: Ancient and Modern|author= Martin, Edith|publisher=A.

For Pasties sold in the United Kingdom, the '''Meat Pie and Sausage Roll Regulation 1967''' states that Pasties must contain meat that is a minimum 12.75% of the weight of the pastry.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vRcidxIUWYMC&dq=%22meat+and+vegetable+pasties%22&pg=PA217|title=Food Preparation and Cooking Cookery units.

A part-savoury, part-sweet pasty (similar to the [[Bedfordshire clanger]]) was eaten by miners in the 19th century, in the copper mines on [[Parys Mountain]], [[Anglesey]]. The technician who did the research and discovered the recipe claimed that the recipe was probably taken to Anglesey by Cornish miners travelling to the area looking for work.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/north_west/4841110.stm |title=UK &#124; Wales &#124; North West Wales &#124; Sweet-savoury pastie back on menu |work=BBC News |date=26 March 2006 |access-date=21 September 2009 |archive-date=6 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206032635/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/north_west/4841110.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> No two-course pasties are commercially produced in Cornwall today,<ref name="merrick">{{cite book|title=The Pasty Book|first=Hettie|last= Merrick|publisher=Tor Mark Press |place=Penryn|year=1995}}</ref> but are usually the product of amateur cooks.<ref name="nyt" /> They are, however, commercially available in the British supermarket chain [[Morrisons]] (under the name 'Tin Miner Pasty').<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cornishpasties.org.uk/Pasties-with-aftersVIII-Morrisons-Tin-Miners.htm|title=The Cornish Pasty presents: The Morrisons Tin Miner Pasty|last=Ryan|first=Keith|website=www.cornishpasties.org.uk|access-date=15 January 2018|archive-date=4 January 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220104122118/http://cornishpasties.org.uk/Pasties-with-aftersVIII-Morrisons-Tin-Miners.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> Other traditional fillings have included a wide variety of locally available meats including pork, bacon, egg, rabbit, chicken, [[mackerel]] and sweet fillings such as dates, apples, [[jam]] and sweetened rice - leading to the oft-quoted joke that 'the Devil hisself was afeared to cross over into Cornwall for fear that ee'd end up in a pasty'.<ref name="ReferenceA">Cornish Recipes, Ancient & Modern, Edith Martin, Truro, 1929</ref>

The food is mentioned as being popularised in America by Cornishmen, as a parallel to how gods are "brought over" to America in the rest of the story. Another literature reference takes place in ''[[The Cat Who...|The Cat Who]]'' ... series by [[Lilian Jackson Braun]]. Pasties are referred to as a cultural part of the north country, and Jim Qwilleran often eats at The Nasty Pasty, a popular restaurant in fictional Moose County, famous for its tradition of being a mining settlement. Reference to pasties is made in [[Brian Jacques]]' popular ''[[Redwall]]'' series of novels, where it is a staple favourite on the menu to the mice and creatures of Redwall Abbey. Pumpkin pasties are among the foods enjoyed by the young [[Wizarding World|wizards]] of [[J. K. Rowling]]'s [[Harry Potter]] series. Pasties also appear in the ''[[The Poldark Novels|Poldark]]'' series of [[historical novel]]s of Cornwall, by [[Winston Graham]], as well as the [[BBC]] television series adapted from these works.--->

===Superstitions, rhymes and chants===
In the tin mines of Devon and Cornwall, pasties were associated with "[[knocker (folklore)|knocker]]s", spirits said to create a knocking sound that was either supposed to indicate the location of rich veins of ore,<ref>{{cite book|last=Froud|first=Brian|title=Faeries|year=2002|publisher=Pavilion|isbn=1-86205-558-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9MgsqlMARBAC&q=pastie+knockers}}</ref> or to warn of an impending tunnel collapse. To encourage the good will of the knockers, miners would leave a small part of the pasty within the mine for them to eat.<ref name="Trust">{{cite book | title=Gentleman's Relish: And Other Culinary Oddities | author=National Trust | author-link=National Trust | year=2007 | publisher=Anova Books | pages=78–9 | isbn=978-1-905400-55-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cRcQizr0uy8C&pg=PA79}}</ref> Sailors and fisherman would likewise discard a crust to appease the spirits of dead mariners, though fishermen believed that it was bad luck to take a pasty aboard ship.<ref name="Trust" />

A Cornish proverb, recounted in 1861, emphasised the great variety of ingredients that were used in pasties by saying that the devil would not come into Cornwall for fear of ending up as a filling in one.<ref>{{cite book|last=Halliwell|first=James Orchard|title=Rambles in Western Cornwall by the Footsteps of the Giants|url=https://archive.org/details/ramblesinwestern00halluoft|year=1861|publisher=John Russell Smith|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ramblesinwestern00halluoft/page/40 40]–41|quote=In fact so universal are the contents of Cornish pasties, a local proverb states that the devil will not venture into Cornwall, for if the inhabitants caught him, they would be sure to put him into a pie}}</ref> A [[Cornwall|Cornish]] schoolboy [[playground]]-[[rhyme]] current in the 1940s concerning the pasty went: {{blockquote|[[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]], [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] and [[John the Apostle|John]], ate a pasty five feet long,<br />Bit it once, Bit it twice, Oh my Lord, it's full of mice.<ref name="hall" />}} In 1959 the English singer-songwriter [[Cyril Tawney]] wrote a nostalgic song called "The Oggie Man". The song tells of the pasty-seller with his characteristic vendor's call who was always outside Plymouth's [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport Naval Dockyard]] gates late at night when the sailors were returning, and his replacement by hot dog sellers after World War II.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyriltawney.co.uk/depth.htm#oggie|title=Tawney in Depth – The background to some of Cyril's classic songs|publisher=cyriltawney.co.uk|access-date=6 September 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826085846/http://www.cyriltawney.co.uk/depth.htm#oggie|archive-date=26 August 2010}}</ref>

The word "oggy" in the internationally popular chant "[[Oggy Oggy Oggy|Oggy Oggy Oggy, Oi Oi Oi]]" is thought to stem from Cornish dialect "''[[hoggan]]''", deriving from "hogen" the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] word for pasty. When the pasties were ready for eating, the [[bal maiden]]s at the mines would supposedly shout down the shaft "Oggy Oggy Oggy" and the miners would reply "Oi Oi Oi".<ref>{{cite news|last=Gibson|first=Rory|title=Time for Aussies to lose 'bogan' chant?|url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/news/time-for-aussies-to-throw-bogan-chant-out/story-e6frfq80-1225943556735|access-date=11 March 2011|newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]]|date=26 October 2010|archive-date=5 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705123749/http://www.news.com.au/travel/news/time-for-aussies-to-throw-bogan-chant-out/story-e6frfq80-1225943556735|url-status=dead}}</ref>{{dubious|date=April 2013}}

===Giant pasties===
As the 'national dish' of Cornwall, several oversized versions of the pasty have been created in the county. For example, a giant pasty is paraded from [[Polruan]] to [[Fowey]] through the streets during regatta week.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jago|first=M|title=Regatta beats the odds|url=http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/Regatta-beats-odds/story-11374997-detail/story.html|access-date=4 March 2011|work=This is Cornwall|date=26 August 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208174159/http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/Regatta-beats-odds/story-11374997-detail/story.html|archive-date=8 February 2012}}</ref> Similarly, a giant pasty is paraded around the ground of the [[Cornish Pirates]] rugby team on [[St Piran's Day]] before it is passed over the goal posts.<ref>{{cite news|last=Richards|first=N|title=Pirates ready for big cup test|url=http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/Pirates-ready-big-cup-test/story-11396805-detail/story.html|access-date=4 March 2011|work=This is Cornwall|date=5 March 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208192848/http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/Pirates-ready-big-cup-test/story-11396805-detail/story.html|archive-date=8 February 2012}}</ref>
