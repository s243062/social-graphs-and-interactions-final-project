'''Ful medames''' ({{langx|ar|فول مدمس|fūl midammis}} {{IPA|ar|fuːl meˈdammes|IPA}}; other spellings include ''ful mudammas'' and '' foule mudammes''), or simply '''fūl''', is a stew of cooked [[Vicia faba|fava beans]] served with olive oil, [[cumin]], and optionally with chopped [[parsley]], [[garlic]], [[onion]], [[lemon]] juice, [[chili pepper]] and other vegetables, herbs, and spices.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Cook this: Ful medames from Falastin|url=https://nationalpost.com/life/food/cook-this-ful-medames-from-falastin|access-date=2020-10-05|website=National Post|date=10 July 2020|language=en-CA|last1=Brehaut|first1=Laura}}</ref> Ful medames is traditionally made in and served out of a large metal jug.<ref name=EGYfavabeans>{{Cite web|date=2011-09-30|title=Ful Medames - Egyptian Staple Beans of Delight|url=https://migrationology.com/ful-medames-egypts-life-line-saving-beans-of-delight/|access-date=2021-02-22|website=Migrationology - Food Travel Blog|language=en}}</ref> It is notably a [[staple food]] in [[Sudan]] and [[Egypt]] and is considered a national dish,<ref name=EGYfavabeans/> especially in the northern cities of [[Cairo]] and [[Gizah]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} Fava beans can also sometimes be found in other [[cuisine]]s in the [[Middle East]], and [[Africa]], though cooked differently.

==History==
Some writers have suggested that ful medames dated all the way back to [[Ancient Egypt]].<ref name="Albala">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hTBv607RId8C&q=ful+medames+staple+food+cairo&pg=PT30|title=Beans: A History|isbn=9780857850782|last1=Albala|first1=Ken|date=September 2007}}</ref>

Some evidence of the use of ful is a cache of 2,600 dried fava beans unearthed at a late Neolithic site on the outskirts of [[Nazareth]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ojc4Uker_V0C&pg=PA191|title=Encyclopedia of Jewish Food|first=Gil|last=Marks|date=November 17, 2010|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9780470943540 |via=Google Books}}</ref>

This dish is mentioned in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]], indicating that it was used in the Horn of Africa and Middle Eastern countries since the fourth century. Although there are countless ways of embellishing ''fūl'', the basic recipe remains the same. Once the ''fūl'' is cooked, it is salted and eaten plain or accompanied by [[vegetable oil]], corn oil, butter, clarified butter, buffalo milk, [[béchamel sauce]], cured beef ([[Pastirma|basturma]]), fried or boiled eggs, [[tomato sauce]], [[garlic sauce]], [[tahini]], fresh lemon juice, [[chili pepper]]s, or other ingredients.<ref name="Albala" />

In the Middle Ages, the making of ''fūl'' in [[Cairo]] was monopolized by the people living around the Princess Baths, a [[public bath]] in a tiny compound near today's public fountain of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad ‘Ali Pasha]], a block north of the two elegant minarets of the [[Mosque of Sultan al-Muayyad]] above the 11th century Bab Zuweila gate. During the day, bath attendants stoked the fires heating the ''qidras'', which are huge pots of bath water. Wood was scarce, so garbage was used as fuel and eventually a dump grew around the baths. When the baths closed, the red embers of the fires continued to burn. To take advantage of these precious fires, huge ''qidras'' were filled with fava beans, and these cauldrons were kept simmering all night, and eventually all day too, in order to provide breakfast for Cairo's population. Cookshops throughout Cairo would send their minions to the Princess Baths to buy their wholesale ''fūl''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cliffordawright.com/caw/food/entries/display.php/id/60/ |title=Professor Janet Abu-Lughod - Princeton University Press |access-date=2010-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429201143/http://www.cliffordawright.com/caw/food/entries/display.php/id/60/ |archive-date=2014-04-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Fūl is prepared from the small, round bean known in Egypt as ''fūl medames'' ("brown beans"). The beans are cooked until very soft. Other kinds of beans used by Egyptian cooks are ''fūl rūmī'' ("Roman", i.e. "European broad beans"), large kidney-shaped fava beans, and ''fūl baladī'' ("country beans", which are of middling size). ''Fūl nābit'' (Coptic: ⲫⲉⲗⲉⲧⲣⲏⲧ, Feletrat) are fava bean sprouts, ''fūl akhḍar'' ("green fūl") are fresh fava beans, and ''fūl madshūsh'' ("crushed fūl") are crushed fava beans.

Ful medames was exported from [[Egypt]] to other parts of the [[Arab world]], as well as other parts of Africa and Asia, but particularly to [[Iraq]], [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], [[Israel]], [[Palestine]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Yemen]], [[Bahrain]], [[Somalia]], [[Djibouti]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]], [[South Sudan]], [[Sudan]], [[Morocco]] and [[Libya]].<ref name="auto"/>

===Middle East===
Ful medames is a popular breakfast dish in [[Syria]], especially [[Aleppo]]. The fava beans are left simmering in large copper jars throughout the night, to be served from the next morning on; the beans swim in tahini and olive oil, completed with a hint of red pepper paste (made from [[Aleppo pepper]]) over the top.

In [[Jordan]], ful is made just like hummus in a form of a dip, usually made with tahini, garlic, tomato, lemon juice, ground cumin, olive oil, green peppers and salt.

In [[Jerusalem]] and surrounding areas, ful is often served on top of [[hummus]], such a setup is sometimes referred to as ''Qudsiyeh'' ({{Langx|ar|قدسية||From Jerusalem}}) outside of Jerusalem.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kassis |first1=Reem |author1-link=Reem Kassis |title=Qudsiyeh (Hummus Topped With Fava Beans) |url=https://www.seriouseats.com/qudsiyeh-hummus-topped-with-fava-beans-recipe-8641078 |website=Serious Eats |access-date=19 May 2025 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Qudsiya – Middle East Monitor |url=https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20220730-qudsiya/ |website=Middle East Monitor |access-date=19 May 2025}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=من المطبخ الفلسطيني.. طريقة عمل قدسية الفول بالحمص في سحور رمضان |url=https://akhbarelyom.com/news/VideoDisplay/4315346/1/ |access-date=4 November 2025 |work=Akhbar el-Yom |date=29 Feb 2024 |language=ar |trans-title=From Palestinian cuisine: How to make fava bean and chickpea stew for Ramadan suhoor}}</ref>

Ful medames is consumed as part of the [[Lent]] diet by [[Christianity in the Middle East|Christian communities in Arab countries]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Oxford Companion to Food|first=Alan |last=Davidson|year= 2014| isbn=9780191040726| page =295|publisher=Oxford University Press |quote=}}</ref>

Ful medames forms part of the [[Israeli breakfast]] popularized by [[kibbutzim]] in [[Israel]].

===Africa===
In [[Somalia]], fuul is a staple in breakfast food. It is often served with eggs, [[Khubz|khubz/ceesh]] bread or the traditional Somali flatbread called [[Lahoh|laxoox/canjeero]]. It is very similar to the [[Egypt]]ian, [[Sudan]]ese, and [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] variants of the dish, but usually spicier due to Somalis' use of the xawaash spice mixture ([[cumin]], [[coriander]], sage, [[Black pepper|peppercorn]], [[fenugreek]], [[turmeric]], [[ginger]], [[cardamom]], [[clove]]s, [[nutmeg]], and [[saffron]]).

In [[Morocco]] ful is known as ''[[bissara]]'' and consists of fava beans and split green peas (known locally as ''jabbana'') boiled together with garlic and served with cumin and seasoning. It is particularly popular in the north of the country and is eaten during the cold winter months.

In [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]], ful is one of the few dishes not eaten with a pancake-like bread called ''[[injera]]'' but is served with wheat flour bread. Places serving ful and the accompanying flour bread often provide a communal kitchen for patrons seeking to bake such types of breads since flour bread is not typical in the Ethiopian or Eritrean diet. The beans are topped, or mixed with, a combination of oil and ''[[berbere]]''.

===Other regions===
In [[Malta]], ''ful bit-tewm'' (beans with garlic) is usually associated with [[Fasting and abstinence in the Roman Catholic Church|fasting]] during [[Lent]] and [[Good Friday]]. The beans are soaked in water overnight, cooked in oil with garlic and fresh or dried mint, then dressed with olive oil or vinegar before serving.

The meal has also travelled as far as [[Malaysia]], in particular the state of [[Johore]], and [[Singapore]] where it has been adapted into the local recipe ''kacang pool'', which incorporates [[ghee]] in place of oil and minced meat.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rasa.my/kacang-pool-mudah-dimasak-sarapan-popular-kat-johor-bahru/|title=Kacang Pool Mudah Dimasak, Sarapan Popular kat Johor|author1=Faridah Talib|date=21 January 2020|magazine=Rasa|language=ms|access-date=12 December 2012}}</ref> [[Kidney beans]] and [[baked beans]] are also added to give the dish more body.

== Salad ==

Ful medames salad ({{langx|ar|سلطة فول مدمس}}) is an [[Arab cuisine|Arab]] [[breakfast]] [[Meze|mezze]] favorite, but it is also eaten as a hearty salad. It typically consists of [[fava beans]], chopped [[tomato]]es, [[onion]], [[parsley]], [[Lemon|lemon juice]], [[olive oil]], pepper and [[salt]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.zenanzaatar.com/ful-medames-syrian-style-arabic-bean-salad-vegan-gf/|title=Ful Medames, Syrian Style (Arabic Bean Salad) [Vegan, GF] - Zena 'n Zaatar|last=Zena|date=2017-01-26|work=Zena 'n Zaatar|access-date=2017-04-18|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mylebanesemarket.com/fava-bean-salad-foul-medames/|title=Fava Bean Salad – Foul Medames|website=My Lebanese Market|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-18|archive-date=2017-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419002937/http://www.mylebanesemarket.com/fava-bean-salad-foul-medames/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.foodservicedirector.com/menu-development/recipedia/articles/ful-medames-salad|title=Ful Medames Salad|work=FoodService Director|access-date=2017-04-18|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eastmedfood.com/beautiful-beans-from-east-med-simple-midweek-dinner-ful-medames/|title=Recipe Beautiful fava beans from East Med (Ful Medames / foul) – East Med Food|website=www.eastmedfood.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-18|archive-date=2017-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419002849/http://www.eastmedfood.com/beautiful-beans-from-east-med-simple-midweek-dinner-ful-medames/|url-status=dead}}</ref>
