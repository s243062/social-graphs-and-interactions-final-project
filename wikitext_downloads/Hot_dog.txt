== History ==
[[File:Coney Island Hot Dogs (1940).webm|thumb|left|A hot dog as served on [[Coney Island hot dog|Coney Island]] in 1940]]

The word ''frankfurter'' comes from [[Frankfurt]], Germany, where pork sausages similar to hot dogs originated.<ref>{{OEtymD|frankfurter|access-date=2009-10-17}}</ref> These sausages, ''[[Frankfurter Würstchen]]'', were known since the 13th century and given to the people on the event of imperial coronations, starting with the coronation of [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor]], as King. "Wiener" refers to [[Vienna|Vienna, Austria]] ({{langx|de|Wien}}), home to a sausage made of a mixture of pork and beef.<ref>{{OEtymD|wiener |access-date=2009-10-17}}</ref> Johann Georg Lahner, an 18th/19th century butcher from the [[Franconia]]n city of Coburg, is said to have brought the ''Frankfurter Würstchen'' to Vienna, where he added beef to the mixture and simply called it ''Frankfurter''.<ref>{{harvcolnb|Schmidt|2003|p=241}}</ref> Nowadays, in German-speaking countries, except Austria, hot dog sausages are called ''Wiener'' or ''[[Vienna Sausage|Wiener Würstchen]]'' (''Würstchen'' means "little sausage"), to differentiate them from the original pork-only mixture from [[Frankfurt]]. In [[Swiss German]], it is called ''Wienerli'', while in Austria the terms ''Frankfurter'' or ''Frankfurter Würstel'' are used.{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}

A German immigrant named [[Feuchtwanger]], from [[Frankfurt]], in [[Hesse]], allegedly pioneered the practice in the American Midwest; there are several versions of the story with varying details. According to one account, Feuchtwanger's wife proposed the use of a bun in 1880: Feuchtwanger sold hot dogs on the streets of [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and provided gloves to his customers so that they could handle the sausages without burning their hands. Losing money when customers did not return the gloves, Feuchtwanger's wife suggested serving the sausages in a roll instead.<ref>{{cite web |author=KiteFly Web Design – kitefly.com |url=http://www.hotdogchicagostyle.com/history.php |title=Hot Dog History |publisher=Hotdogchicagostyle.com |access-date=2012-03-05 |archive-date=2010-12-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204012255/http://hotdogchicagostyle.com/history.php |url-status=live }}</ref> In another version, Antoine Feuchtwanger, or Anton Ludwig Feuchtwanger, served sausages in rolls at the World's Fair&nbsp;– either at the 1904 [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] in St. Louis,<ref>Allen, Beth; Westmoreland, Susan (ed.)

Another possible origin for serving the sausages in rolls is the pieman [[Charles Feltman]], at [[Coney Island]] in New York City. In 1867 he had a cart made with a stove on which to boil sausages, and a compartment to keep buns in which they were served fresh. In 1871 he leased land to build a permanent restaurant, and the business grew, selling far more than just the "Coney Island Red Hots" as they were known.<ref>{{harvcolnb|McCullough|2000|pp=234–36}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.westland.net/coneyisland/articles/food.htm|title=Coney Island History -Food & Dining|website=www.westland.net|access-date=2017-09-11|archive-date=2017-02-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218170521/http://www.westland.net/coneyisland/articles/food.htm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.coneyislandhistory.org/hall-of-fame/charles-feltman|title=Charles Feltman|date=2015-05-22|work=Coney Island History Project|access-date=2017-09-11|language=en|archive-date=2017-09-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911205025/http://www.coneyislandhistory.org/hall-of-fame/charles-feltman|url-status=live}}</ref>

An early use of the term ''hot dog'' in reference to the sausage-meat appears in the ''Evansville'' (Indiana) ''Daily Courier'' (September 14, 1884):

<blockquote>even the innocent 'wienerworst' man will be barred from dispensing hot dog on the street corner.<ref name="oedhotdog">{{Cite OED|term=hot dog|access-date=10 September 2017}}</ref></blockquote>

It was used to mean a sausage in casing in the ''Paterson'' (New Jersey) ''Daily Press'' (31 December 1892):

<blockquote>the 'hot dog' was quickly inserted in a gash in a roll.<ref name="oedhotdog" /></blockquote>

Subsequent uses include the ''New Brunswick Daily Times'' (New Jersey; May 20, 1893), the ''New York World'' (May 26, 1893), and the ''Knoxville Journal'' (September 28, 1893).<ref name="popik" />

According to one story, the use of the complete phrase ''hot dog'' (in reference to sausage) was coined by the newspaper cartoonist [[Thomas A. Dorgan|Thomas Aloysius "Tad" Dorgan]] around 1900 in a cartoon recording the sale of hot dogs during a [[New York Giants (baseball)|New York Giants]] baseball game at the [[Polo Grounds]].<ref name="popik" /> He may have used the term because he did not know how to spell "dachshund".<ref name="wilton" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allrecipes.com/article/hot-dogs-history/|title=How Did Hot Dogs Get Their Name?|website=Allrecipes|access-date=8 May 2023|archive-date=29 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230429223013/https://www.allrecipes.com/article/hot-dogs-history/|url-status=live}}</ref> No copy of the apocryphal cartoon has ever been found.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.snopes.com/language/stories/hotdog.asp | title=Hot Dog | website=Snopes | date=July 13, 2007 | access-date=2007-12-13 | archive-date=2023-07-03 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230703223845/https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hot-dog/ | url-status=live }}</ref> Dorgan did use the term at other times; the earliest known example was in connection with a bicycle race at [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden]], appearing in ''[[New York Journal-American|The New York Evening Journal]]'' of December 12, 1906.<ref name="wilton" /><ref name="popik">"[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/hot_dog_polo_grounds_myth_original_monograph/ Hot Dog (Polo Grounds myth & original monograph)] barrypopik.com {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608215101/http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/hot_dog_polo_grounds_myth_original_monograph/ |date=2011-06-08 }}"</ref>

=== Ingredients ===
Common hot dog sausage ingredients include:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hot-dog.org/sausage-basics/sausage-glossary|title=Sausage Glossary &#124; NHDSC|website=www.hot-dog.org|access-date=2020-09-02|archive-date=2020-09-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200901150637/http://hot-dog.org/sausage-basics/sausage-glossary}}</ref>
*Meat trimmings and fat
*Flavorings, such as salt, garlic, and [[paprika]]
*Preservatives (cure) – typically [[sodium erythorbate]] and sodium nitrite

Pork and beef are the traditional meats used in hot dogs. Less expensive hot dogs are often made from chicken or turkey, using low-cost [[mechanically separated poultry]]. Changes in meat technology and dietary preferences have led manufacturers to lower the salt content and use turkey, chicken, and vegetarian meat substitutes.

=== Commercial preparation ===
[[File:This Is Hormel (1964) hot dog segment.webm|thumb|Hormel hot dogs going into a smoker (1964)]]
Hot dogs are prepared commercially by mixing the ingredients (meats, spices, binders and fillers) in vats where rapidly moving blades grind and mix the ingredients in the same operation. This mixture is forced through tubes into casings for cooking. Most hot dogs sold in the US are "skinless" rather than "natural casing" sausages.

==== Natural casing ====
As with most sausages, hot dogs must be in a casing to be cooked. Traditional casing is made from the small intestines of sheep. The products are known as "natural casing" hot dogs or frankfurters.<ref name=levine>{{harvcolnb|Levine|2005}}:[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/25/dining/25dogs.html It's All in How the Dog Is Served] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830110301/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/25/dining/25dogs.html |date=2011-08-30 }}</ref> These hot dogs have firmer texture and a "snap" that releases juices and flavor when the product is bitten.<ref name=levine/>

[[Kosher foods|Kosher]] casings are expensive in commercial quantities in the US, so kosher hot dogs are usually skinless or made with reconstituted collagen casings.<ref name=levine/>

==== Skinless ====
"Skinless" hot dogs use a casing for cooking, but the casing may be a long tube of thin [[cellulose]] that is removed between cooking and packaging, a process invented in Chicago in 1925<ref name="zeldes">{{cite web | last = Zeldes | first = Leah A. | title = Know your wiener! | work = Dining Chicago | publisher = Chicago's Restaurant & Entertainment Guide, Inc. | date = 2010-07-08 | url = http://www.diningchicago.com/blog/2010/07/08/know-your-wiener/ | access-date = 2010-07-31 | archive-date = 2011-07-10 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110710093609/http://www.diningchicago.com/blog/2010/07/08/know-your-wiener/ }}</ref> by Erwin O.

The first skinless hot dog casings were produced by Freund's new company under the name "[[Viskase#Products|Nojax]]", short for "no jackets" and sold to local Chicago sausage makers.

Skinless hot dogs vary in surface texture, but have a softer "bite" than with natural casing.  Skinless hot dogs are more uniform in shape and size and cheaper to make than natural casing hot dogs.

Typically it is served in a hot dog bun with various condiments and toppings. The sausage itself may be sliced and added to other dishes such as [[Beanie weenie|beanie weinie]] or [[filipino spaghetti]].

Many nicknames applying to either have emerged over the years, including frankfurter, frank, wiener, weenie, [[Coney Island hot dog|coney]], and red hot.  Annually, Americans consume 20 billion hot dogs.<ref>{{cite web |title=In 2016, consumers spent more than $2.4 billion on hot dogs in U.S. supermarkets |url=http://www.hot-dog.org/media/consumption-stats |publisher=National Hot Dog & Sausage Council |access-date=4 July 2018 |archive-date=22 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200822080333/http://www.hot-dog.org/media/consumption-stats }}</ref>

Stands and trucks sell boiled hot dogs at street and highway locations.  Wandering hot dog vendors sell their product in baseball parks.  At convenience stores, hot dogs are kept heated on rotating grills. Hot dogs are also common on restaurants' children's menus.

Other toppings include sauerkraut, mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and chili peppers.

Condiment preferences vary across the U.S. Southerners showed the strongest preference for chili, while Midwesterners showed the greatest affinity for ketchup.<ref>{{cite web| title= Fire in their Bellies: Sixty Percent of Americans Prefer Hot Dogs Grilled, New Hot Dog Council Poll Data Shows Mustard Takes 'Gold Medal' in Topping Poll| url=http://www.hot-dog.org/pr/052505.htm | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20050616014926/http://www.hot-dog.org/pr/052505.htm | publisher= National Hot Dog & Sausage Council; American Meat Institute | date= 25 May 2005 | access-date= 29 March 2013 | archive-date= 16 June 2005}}</ref>[[File:Sigh and Elaine Bell Catering Pop-Up, Sonoma, California 07.jpg|thumb|A hot dog made from [[Lamb meat|lamb]] in [[Sonoma, California]]]]

In most of the world, a "hot dog" is recognized as a sausage in a bun, but the type varies considerably. The name is often applied to something that would not be described as a hot dog in North America. For example, in New Zealand a "hot dog" is a battered sausage, often on a stick, which is known as a [[corn dog]] in North America; an "American hot dog" is the version in a [[bun]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Rough Guide to New Zealand|author=Rough Guides|isbn=978-0-241-18670-1|year=2010|publisher=[[Rough Guides]]}}</ref>
