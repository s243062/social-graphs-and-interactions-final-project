'''Simit''' is a circular [[bread]], typically [[wikt:encrusted|encrusted]] with [[sesame seed]]s or, less commonly, poppy, [[flax]] or sunflower seeds, found across the [[Ottoman cuisine|cuisines of the former Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Middle East]], especially in Armenia, Turkey and the Balkans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnnturk.com/yasam/diger/turkiye-ve-yunanistanin-simit-savasi-kizisiyor-1702|title = Türkiye ve Yunanistan'ın simit savaşı kızışıyor}}</ref> Simit's size, crunch, chewiness, and other characteristics vary slightly by region.

In [[İzmir]], simit is known as ''gevrek'' ("crisp"), although it is very similar to the [[Istanbul]] variety. Simit in [[Ankara]] are smaller and crisper than those of other cities.{{cn|date=December 2020}}

==Origins==
Archival sources show that ''simit'' has been produced in [[Istanbul]] since 1525.<ref>Sahillioğlu, Halil. "Osmanlılarda Narh Müessesesi ve 1525 Yılı Sonunda İstanbul’da Fiyatlar" ''Belgelerle Türk Tarihi'' '''2''' (The Narh Institution in the Ottoman Empire and the Prices in Istanbul in Late 1525. Documents in Turkish History 2) (Kasım 1967): 56</ref> Based on [[Üsküdar]] court records (Şer’iyye Sicili) dated 1593,<ref>Ünsal, Artun. Susamlı Halkanın Tılsımı.[The Secret of the Ring with Sesames] İstanbul: YKY, 2010: 45</ref> the weight and price of simit was standardized for the first time. The 17th-century traveler [[Evliya Çelebi]] wrote that there were 70 simit bakeries in Istanbul during the 1630s.<ref>'''Evliya Çelebi''' Seyahatnâmesi Kitap I. [The Seyahatname Book I] ([[Robert Dankoff]], Seyit Ali Kahraman, Yücel Dağlı).

Simit is generally served plain, or for [[breakfast]] with tea, [[fruit preserves]], or [[cheese]] or [[ayran]]. Drinking [[tea]] with simit is traditional. Simit ("Bokegh" in Armenian) is a traditional Christmas bread in Armenia.{{cn|date=December 2020}}

Simit are generally sold by [[street vendor]]s in Turkey,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.lezzetlitatlitarifleri.com/citir-burgu-simit-tarifi/ | title=Çıtır Burgu Simit Tarifi - Lezzetli Tatlı Tarifleri }}</ref> who either have a simit trolley or carry the simit in a tray on their head. Street merchants generally advertise simit as fresh ("''Taze simit!''"/"''Taze gevrek!''")<ref name="ft2025">{{cite news |title=An ode to simit, Istanbul’s chewy, timeless superfood |url=https://www.ft.com/content/d41376e9-0dda-4f00-a188-6c9272abbb96 |access-date=6 October 2025 |work=FT |date=6 Oct 2025}}</ref> since they are baked throughout the day; otherwise hot ("''Sıcak, sıcak!''") and extremely hot ("''El yakıyor!''" means "It burns the hand!") when they are not long out of the oven.{{cn|date=December 2020}}

Simit is an important symbol for lower and middle-class people of Turkey. Sometimes it is called ''susam kebabı'' ("sesame [[kebab]]").{{Cn|date=March 2025}}

In other parts of the Middle East, in Egypt it is consumed with boiled eggs and/or [[Duqqa|duggah]], which is a mixture of herbs used as condiments. It is commonly used to break the fast, with yoghurt or buttermilk, in mosques in [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]].{{Cn|date=March 2025}}

Today, many municipalities in Turkey produce simit through their own subsidiaries.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gazete|first=Banka|date=15 November 2021|title=Yesaş simit üretecek|work=Gazete Banka Haber|url=https://gazetebanka.com/yesas-simit-uretecek/10970/|access-date=15 November 2021}}</ref>

==Similar products==
Certain varieties of Romanian [[covrigi]] are similar to simit, the places that sell them even being known as ''simigerii''.

Another type of bread similar to simit is known as ''obwarzanek'' (in particular ''[[obwarzanek krakowski]]'') in Poland and ''[[bublik]]'' in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. The main difference is that the rings of dough are poached briefly in boiling water prior to baking (similarly to [[bagel]]s), instead of being dipped in water and molasses syrup, as is the case with simit.{{Cn|date=April 2023}}

Girde (Uygur: Гирде) is a type of bread baked on the walls of tandoori oven, that is very similar to simit, and that the [[Uyghurs]] in [[China]] see as a characteristic item in their culture-specific kitchen.{{Cn|date=March 2025}}
