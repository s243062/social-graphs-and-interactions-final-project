'''Feijoada''' or '''''feijoada à brasileira''''' (lit. Portuguese for "'''Brazilian-style ''feijoada'''''") is a dish that consists of a stew of black beans with various types of pork and beef. It is served with ''[[farofa]]'', white rice, sautéed [[collard green]], and sliced oranges, among other sides. It is a popular dish, typical of Brazilian cuisine.

First documented in [[Recife]], State of [[Pernambuco]], feijoada has been described as a [[national dish]] of [[Brazilian cuisine|Brazil]], especially of Pernambuco and Bahia, as other parts of Brazil have other regional dishes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://super.abril.com.br/comportamento/a-feijoada-nao-e-invencao-brasileira/|title=A feijoada não é invenção brasileira|language=pt|publisher=Superinteressante|access-date=26 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://basilio.fundaj.gov.br/pesquisaescolar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=546:o-carapuceiro-jornal&catid=38:letra-c|title=O Carapuceiro (jornal)|language=pt|publisher=Fundaj|access-date=26 June 2017|archive-date=9 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909233742/http://basilio.fundaj.gov.br/pesquisaescolar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=546:o-carapuceiro-jornal&catid=38:letra-c|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== History ==

''[[Feijoada]]'' is a common name given to dishes from Portuguese-speaking countries. The Brazilian version of the delicacy is probably an adaptation of the Portuguese stew which originated in the north of this 

The first known mention of "''feijoada à brasileira''" was in [[Recife]], Pernambuco, in 1827.<ref>{{cite web |title=A feijoada foi mesmo criada pelos escravos? |url=https://super.abril.com.br/saude/a-feijoada-foi-criada-pelos-escravos/ |access-date=5 June 2017 |publisher=Superinteressante}}<!-- auto-translated by Moduletranslator --></ref> In Brazil, the first mention of the dish dates back to the beginning of the 19th century in an advertisement published in no. 47 of the ''Diário de Pernambuco'', in the city of Recife, on March 2, 1827, stating that at the Locanda da Águia d'Ouro, in das Cruzes Street, on Thursdays "excellent Brazilian-style ''feijoada'' would be served, all for a comfortable price."<ref name="Não_nomeado-xr76-1">Newspaper accessed at the periodical library Hemeroteca Digital.</ref><ref name="dp">{{cite web|access-date=12 April 2023|author=Paulo Goethe|date=2 May 2016|title=O padre que perdeu para a feijoada|url=https://blogs.diariodepernambuco.com.br/diretodaredacao/2016/05/02/o-padre-que-perdeu-para-a-feijoada/|work=Diario de Pernambuco}}<!-- auto-translated by Module:CS1 translator --></ref> On August 7, 1833, also in Recife, the advertisement for the newly opened Hôtel Théatre, published in the ''Diário de Pernambuco'', stated that "''Feijoada à brasileira''" would be served on Thursdays.<ref name="Não_nomeado-xr76-1" /><ref name="Théâtre">{{cite web|access-date=3 March 2017|publisher=Superinteressante|title=A feijoada não é invenção brasileira|url=https://super.abril.com.br/comportamento/a-feijoada-nao-e-invencao-brasileira/}}<!-- auto-translated by Module:CS1 translator --></ref> On March 3, 1840, still in the ''Diário de Pernambuco'', Father Carapuceiro published an article in which he said:<ref name="dp" /><blockquote>In families where true gastronomy is unknown, where they have gatherings, it is usual and common practice to convert the leftovers of the previous day's dinner into ''feijoada'', which they call 'the burial of the bones' [...] Leftover turkey, roast suckling pigs, bacon and ham cutouts are thrown into a large pot or cauldron, as well as a good few pieces of dried meat, known as ''ceará'', all mixed with the indispensable beans: everything is reduced to a grease!<ref>Gaspar, Lúcia.

[[File:Feijoada à brasileira 1.jpg|thumb|Brazilian-style feijoada stew.]]
In 1848, the same Recife newspaper announced the sale of "bacon meat, suitable for ''feijoadas'', at 80 réis a pound". On January 6, 1849, the ''[[Jornal do Commercio]]'', from [[Rio de Janeiro]], announced that the newly installed "Novo Café do Commércio" restaurant, next to the "Fama do Café com Leite" bar, would serve "''A Bella Feijoada à Brazilleira''" every Tuesday and Thursday, at the request of many customers.

On page two of the October 1st, 1860 edition of the [[Ceará]] newspaper ''D. Pedro II,'' in a pamphlet entitled "Amor d'um Escravo", Oscar Comettant describes ''feijoada'' as follows: "This food consists of salted meat, dried in the sun, black beans, small but very good, bacon, and to combine everything, a very coarse flour, which is made from the [[cassava]] root. From the mixture of these ingredients, a kind of dark porridge is formed, which may look unappealing but has a very pleasant taste. ''Feijoada'' (that is what that mixture is called) is the important dish of every modest dinner in Brazil: it is the meat pot [a reference to the French ''[[pot-au-feu]]''] among us, and the ''[[puchero]]'' in Spain."<ref name="Não_nomeado-xr76-1" />

There is also a receipt for a purchase by the Imperial Household, dated April 30, 1889, from a butcher in the city of [[Petrópolis]], in the state of Rio de Janeiro, which shows that green meat, veal, mutton, pork, sausage, blood sausage, liver, kidneys, tongue, brains, offal, and tripe sauces were consumed. This proves that it was not only slaves who ate these ingredients and that they were considered delicacies. In 1817, Jean-Baptiste Debret already reported on the regulation of the profession of "''tripeiro''" ("triper") in the city of Rio de Janeiro, who were street vendors who obtained these animal parts from cattle and pig slaughterhouses. Debret also reports that the brains went to hospitals and that the liver, heart, and guts (of cows, oxen, and pigs) were used to make ''angu'' (a type of porridge), which was commonly sold by female slaves or [[Manumission|freedwomen]] in the city's squares and streets. This practice gave rise to what in Rio de Janeiro is known as "''angu à baiana''", mainly because it contains [[Palm oil|dendê oil]] (palm oil).

Both the upper classes and the poor ate black beans, but the upper classes particularly enjoyed them with an assortment of meat and vegetables, similar to feijoada. In contrast, the poor and enslaved usually ate a mixture of black beans and manioc flour.<ref>Elias, Rodrigo. "Feijoada: A short history of an edible institution." ''Flavors from Brazil.''

</ref> The most widespread popular legend about the origin of ''feijoada'' is that the masters gave their slaves the "leftovers" of the pigs when they were being slaughtered. Cooking these ingredients with beans and water gave rise to the recipe. This version, however, is not supported either by culinary tradition or by the slightest historical research. For example, pig's feet were part of Portuguese eating habits, judging by [[Camilo Castelo Branco]]'s novel ''A Brasileira de Prazins'', published in 1882, where it reads: "[...] he preferred the butter of his country, like veal, and the loin of the pig in Portuguese sausages, and the pig's foot in Portuguese tripe."<ref>Camilo Castelo Branco, ''A Brasileira de Prazins'', Chapter VI.</ref> According to historian Carlos Augusto Ditadi, in an article published in ''Gula'' magazine in May 1998, this myth is born of modern folklore, in a romanticized vision of the social and cultural relations of slavery in Brazil.[[File:Feijoada à brasileira -02.jpg|left|thumb|Typical ''feijoada'' dish accompanied by rice, kale and farofa.]]
The ''feijoada completa'' ("complete feijoada"), as it is known, accompanied by rice, sliced oranges, sautéed kale and ''farofa'', was very popular at the Rio de Janeiro restaurant G. Lobo, which was located at 135 General Câmara Street in downtown Rio de Janeiro. The establishment, founded at the end of the 19th century, but disappeared in 1905 with the widening of Uruguaiana Street.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Itamaraty |title=Feijoada: breve história de uma instituição comestível |url=http://dc.itamaraty.gov.br/imagens-e-textos/revista-textos-do-brasil/portugues/revista13-mat6.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903011941/http://dc.itamaraty.gov.br/imagens-e-textos/revista-textos-do-brasil/portugues/revista13-mat6.pdf |archive-date=3 September 2013 |access-date=4 July 2017}}</ref>

In his books ''Baú de Ossos'' and ''Chão de Ferro'', Pedro Nava describes G. Lobo's ''feijoada'', praising the one prepared by Mestre Lobo. The contemporary recipe would have migrated from the kitchen of the G. Lobo's kitchen to the whole country. But Pedro Nava points out that it is (...) "rather the venerable evolution of Latin dishes".<blockquote>(...) It can't be said to have been a spontaneous creation. Rather, it is the venerable evolution of Latin dishes such as the French ''cassoulet'' - a white bean ragù with goose, duck or mutton meat - which requires a stoneware pot - ''cassole'' - to be prepared."</blockquote>The ''feijoada'', in any case, became popular among all social ''strata'' in Brazil, always in a spirit of festivity and celebration, far from recalling scarcity. Those prepared at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century in Rio de Janeiro by the Bahian woman [[Tia Ciata]] were famous.
[[File:Fejuca.png|thumb|Typical ''feijoada'' accompanied by rice, sautéed kale and ''farofa''.]]
And earlier, the writer [[França Júnior|Joaquim José de França Júnior]], in a text from 1867, fictitiously describes a picnic in the Cadeia Velha field, where a ''feijoada'' was served with "(...) loin, pig's head, tripe, mocotós, Rio Grande tongue, ham, dried meat, ''[[paio]]'', bacon, sausages (...)", and, in 1878, he describes a ''feijoada'' in [[Paquetá Island|Paquetá]]: "The word ''feijoada'', whose origin is lost in the night of the times of El-Rei Our Lord, does not always designate the same thing. In the common sense, ''feijoada'' is the appetizing and succulent delicacy of our ancestors, the bulwark of the poor man's table, the ephemeral whim of the rich man's banquet, the essentially national dish, like Martins Pena's theater, and the [[Thrush (bird)|thrush]] of [[Gonçalves Dias]]' heartfelt poetry. In the figurative sense, the word refers to a ''patuscada'', that is, 'a function among friends held in a remote or inconspicuous place."<ref>''Gazeta de Notícias'', November 28, 1877, p. 1, pamphlet entitled "Feijoadas", accessed at Hemeroteca Digital.</ref>

The dish has spread throughout the country as the most representative recipe of Brazilian cuisine. Revised, expanded, and enriched, ''feijoada'' is no longer just a dish. Today, as Câmara Cascudo also noted, it is a complete meal.

The culinary historian [[Jessica B. Harris]] has compared Feijoada to [[soul food|American soul food]]. She has also linked the use of mixed meats, slow-cooking, and the accompaniment of collard greens to the traditions of enslaved African people.<ref name="lam-newyorktimes">{{cite news |last=Lam |first=Francis |date=May 27, 2015 |title=Brazilian Soul Food |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/31/magazine/brazilian-soul-food.html |accessdate=August 5, 2021}}</ref>

The Brazilian version of feijoada (feijoada completa)<ref>{{Cite web |title=Feijoada completa |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/feijoada-completa |access-date=17 December 2020 |publisher=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]}}</ref> is prepared with [[Black turtle bean|black beans]],<ref name="Bayor">[https://books.google.com/books?id=bJW79Rlu-igC&dq=Feijoada&pg=PA180 Multicultural America: An Encyclopedia of the Newest Americans - Google Books<!-- Bot generated title -->] p. 180.</ref> a variety of [[Salting (food)|salted]] pork or beef products, such as pork<ref name="Bayor" /> trimmings (ears, tail, feet),<ref name="Bayor" /> [[bacon]], smoked [[pork ribs]], and at least two types of smoked [[sausage]] and [[jerked beef]] (loin and tongue). The final dish has the beans and meat pieces barely covered by a dark purplish-brown broth. The taste is strong, moderately salty but not spicy, dominated by black bean and meat stew flavors. It is customary to serve it with white rice and oranges, the latter to help with digestion, as well as [[Collard (plant)#Brazil and Portugal|''couve'']], a side dish of stir-fried, chopped collard greens, and a crumbly topping called ''[[farofa]]'', made of [[Cassava#Culinary|manioc flour]].

==Regional variations==
Many modern variants of the dish are based on feijoada recipes popularized in the Brazilian regions of [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[São Paulo]], [[Recife]], and [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]]. The type of bean used in feijoada varies by region. While in the [[Southeast Region, Brazil|southeast]], including Rio de Janeiro and [[Minas Gerais]], feijoada is typically prepared with black beans, in [[Bahia]], [[Sergipe]] and [[Goiás]] brown or red beans are more commonly used.<ref name="lam-newyorktimes"/><ref name="brown-culturetrip">{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Sarah|date=March 17, 2017|title=A Brief Introduction To Feijoada, Brazil's National Dish|url=https://theculturetrip.com/south-america/brazil/articles/a-brief-introduction-to-feijoada-brazils-national-dish|accessdate=July 27, 2021|archive-date=March 17, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230317164514/https://theculturetrip.com/south-america/brazil/articles/a-brief-introduction-to-feijoada-brazils-national-dish|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In [[Pernambuco]], where it was first described and used, it was modified over time because Pernambucans prefer brown beans to black beans. This modified dish is called ''Feijoada pernambucana.<ref>{{cite web |title=Feijoada pernambucana: menos feijão, mais legumes |url=http://www.mulhernareal.com.br/feijoada-pernambucana-menos-feijao-mais-legumes-para-economizar-e-se-esbaldar-nessa-iguaria |access-date=12 April 2023 |work=Mulher na real |archive-date=12 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230412135031/http://www.mulhernareal.com.br/feijoada-pernambucana-menos-feijao-mais-legumes-para-economizar-e-se-esbaldar-nessa-iguaria |url-status=dead }}<!-- auto-translated by Module:CS1 translator --></ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Feijoada Pernambucana |url=https://josistyle.wordpress.com/2020/04/19/feijoada-pernambucana-pernanbuco/ |access-date=12 April 2023}}<!-- auto-translated by Module:CS1 translator --></ref>''

In most of Brazil, feijoada consists of only beans and meat, but in [[Bahia]] and [[Sergipe]] it is common to add vegetables including [[Cooking banana|plantains]], [[kale]], [[potato]]es, [[carrot]]s, [[cabbage]], and [[pumpkin]]s, usually near the end of the cooking process, when they are cooked from beneath by the vapors of the stew.<ref name="brown-culturetrip"/>

== Cultural significance ==
[[File:Feijoada_servida_na_Universidade_Estadual_de_Campinas_em_22.8.2025.6.jpg|thumb|Brazilian feijoada served at the [[State University of Campinas]]]]
As a celebratory dish, feijoada is traditionally served on Saturday afternoons or Sunday lunch and intended to be a leisurely midday meal. It is meant to be enjoyed throughout the day and not eaten under rushed circumstances. The meal is usually eaten among extended family and paired with an event like watching a [[Brazil national football team|football match]] or other social event. Because of the dish's heavy ingredients and rich flavors, feijoada is viewed as Brazilian [[soul food]]. In the city of São Paulo, feijoada is a typical dish in working-class restaurants on Wednesdays and Saturdays, mainly in the commercial area. In Rio de Janeiro, restaurants traditionally serve it on Fridays.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hinchberger |first=Bill |url=https://archive.org/details/nationalgeograph0000hinc |title=National Geographic Traveler: Brazil |publisher=National Geographic Society |year=2014 |isbn=9781426211645 |page=viii |quote=national dish of Brazil black beans pork Friday. |url-access=registration}}</ref> The dish is normally served with a choice among a selection of meats, e.g. pork, bacon, pig ears, pig feet, to fulfill the customer's needs. Other variations of feijoada also exist, such as low fat or vegetarian versions.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Fajans |first=Jane |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gEupAgAAQBAJ |title=Brazilian Food: Race, Class and Identity in Regional Cuisines |date=2013-07-18 |publisher=A&C Black |isbn=9780857850430 |language=en}}</ref>
==In popular culture==
[[Chico Buarque]]'s [[Chico Buarque (1978 album)|1978 album]] contains a song called "Feijoada Completa". The song's lyrics describe the ingredients, the method of preparation, and a typical way in which feijoada is consumed.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TfwgEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT96 |pages=96–97 |title=Music at the Intersection of Brazilian Culture; An Introduction to Music, Race, and Food |author1=Elisa Macedo Dekaney |author2=Joshua A.
