'''Potato pancakes''' are [[Frying|shallow-fried]] [[pancake]]s consisting of grated or ground [[potato]], [[matzo meal]] or [[flour]] and typically a binding ingredient such as [[Egg as food|egg]] or [[corn starch]], often flavored with grated [[garlic]] or [[onion]] and [[seasoning]]s. They may be topped with a variety of [[condiments]], ranging from the savory (such as [[sour cream]] or [[cottage cheese]]), to the sweet (such as [[apple sauce]] or [[sugar]]), or they may be served plain. The dish is sometimes made from [[mashed potato]]es to make pancake-shaped [[croquette]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.all-about-potatoes.com/mashed-potato-pancakes.html |title=Mashed potato pancake recipe |publisher=All-about-potatoes.com |access-date=2011-12-25 |archive-date=2012-02-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218151446/http://www.all-about-potatoes.com/mashed-potato-pancakes.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Some variations are made with [[sweet potato]]es.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = UNC Press Books| isbn = 978-1-4696-1790-9| last = Moose| first = Debbie| title = Southern Holidays: a Savor the South® cookbook| date = 2014-09-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| title = Sweet Potato Latkes, 2 Ways| work = Food Network| access-date = 2018-11-08| url = https://www.foodnetwork.com/healthyeats/recipes/2015/12/sweet-potato-latkes-2-ways}}</ref>

It is the national dish of [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]] and [[Slovakia]]. In [[German cuisine|Germany]], potato pancakes are eaten either salty (as a side dish) or sweet with apple sauce,<ref>{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220012928/http://whatscookingdad.com/potato-pancakes/ |archive-date=2012-02-20 |title=Potato pancakes recipe at "Whats Cooking Dad?" |publisher=Whatscookingdad.com |date=2009-01-06 |access-date=2011-12-25 |url=http://whatscookingdad.com/potato-pancakes/}}</ref> or blueberries, sugar and cinnamon; they are a very common menu item at outdoor markets and festivals in colder seasons.

=== Swedish ''{{lang|sv|raggmunkar}}'', ''{{lang|sv|potatisplättar}}'', ''{{lang|sv|rårakor}}'' and ''{{lang|sv|potatisbullar}}'' ===
[[File:Raggmunk .jpg|thumb|Raggmunk with pork and lingonberries]]
There are four Swedish versions of potato pancakes.
* ''{{lang|sv|Raggmunkar}}'' are prepared with a pancake batter of wheat flour, milk and egg, into which shredded raw potatoes are added. They are fried in butter and look like [[crêpe]]s (i.e. thin pancakes).<ref>[https://www.koket.se/grundrecept-pa-raggmunk ''Köket: Grundrecept på raggmunk''] (Swedish only) Linked 2019-02-14</ref>
* ''{{lang|sv|Potatisplättar}}'' are also made of pancake batter and shredded potatoes, but the potatoes are cooked before they are shredded.<ref>[https://www.koket.se/potatisplattar-2 ''Köket: Potatisplättar''] (Swedish only) Linked 2019-02-14</ref>
* ''{{lang|sv|Rårakor}}'' are a variant more akin to [[hash browns]] and ''[[rösti]]'', i.e. shredded raw potatoes formed as thin pancakes, but without any batter, which are fried in butter. They can be served as a fancy starter with sour creme, red onion and [[Kalix Löjrom]].<ref>[https://www.koket.se/raraka-grundrecept ''Köket: Råraka, grundrecept''] (Swedish only) Linked 2019-02-14</ref>
* ''{{lang|sv|Potatisbullar}}'' are rather thick pancake-like patties of mashed potatoes and eggs, which are turned in breadcrumbs and then fried in butter. Can be bought ready-made in Sweden.<ref>[https://www.hemtrevligt.se/hemmetsjournal/recept/potatisbullar-10949/ ''Hemmets Journal: Potatisbullar''] (Swedish only) Linked 2019-02-14</ref>

All four variants are traditionally served with fried [[bacon]] and [[lingonberry]] jam.

=== Slavic ''draniki'' ===
''Draniki'' are found in many Slavic countries, particularly Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, and Slovakia. Draniki are the national dish of said countries. They are popular in Belarus specifically. The humble potato pancake is a favorite due to its simplicity and taste.

Draniki are traditionally eaten with sour cream.

=== British potato cakes ===
Potato cakes are common in the [[United Kingdom]]. In the [[North East England|North-East of England]] (particularly County Durham), there is a dish known as "tattie fish" because the pancake resembles a deep-fried piece of fish. The pancake consists of flour, eggs, shredded potatoes and onions. Some people add [[tomato]] or [[cheese]] to the mix.

The British also brought potato pancakes to former colonies such as Zimbabwe, where they are an affordable dish still eaten today.

===Irish ''boxty''===
{{main|Boxty}}
{{Further|Irish cuisine}}
A form of potato pancake known as ''[[boxty]]'' ({{langx|ga|bacstaí}}) is a popular traditional dish in most of [[Ireland]], particularly north [[Connacht]] and southern [[Ulster]]. It is made similarly to the British type, with more starch and often with [[buttermilk]] and [[baking soda]]. It has a smooth, grained consistency.

The potato dish is based on an older variant made with cheese instead of potatoes that goes back to at least the Middle Ages.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/food/features/history-of-latkes/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107211050/http://www.pbs.org/food/features/history-of-latkes/|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 7, 2012|title=Discover the History of Latkes - PBS Food|website=[[PBS]] |date=12 December 2011}}</ref>

Latkes need not necessarily be made from potatoes.

The word {{lang|yi-Latn|latke}} itself is derived (via Yiddish) from the [[East Slavic language|East Slavic]] word {{lang|ru-Latn|ladka}}, {{lang|ru-Latn|oladka}}, a diminutive from {{lang|ru-Latn|[[Oladyi|oladya]]}} ({{lang|ru|оладья}}), "small pancake". The word {{Transliteration|he|levivah}} ({{lang|he|לביבה}}), the Hebrew name for latke, refers in the [[Book of Samuel]] to a dumpling made from kneaded dough, as part of the story of [[Amnon]] and [[Tamar (daughter of David)|Tamar]].<ref>{{cite web |author=DLC |url=http://www.balashon.com/2006/12/leviva.html |title=Analysis of the word "latke" |publisher=Balashon |date=2006-12-18 |access-date=2011-12-25}}</ref>
Some interpreters have noted that the homonym {{Transliteration|he|levav}} ({{lang|he|לבב}}) means "heart", and the verbal form of l-v-v occurs in the [[Song of Songs]] as well. In the lexicon of Ashkenazi Jews from [[Udmurtia]] and [[Tatarstan]] there are recorded versions of the kosher-style appellation of latkes (''[[draniki]]'', ''dranki'', ''krezliki'', ''kremzliki'', ''kakorki'', etc.) during the eight-day [[Hanukkah]] holiday.<ref>Altyntsev A.
