'''''Stegt flæsk''''' ({{IPA|da|ˈstekt ˈflesk|lang}}) is a dish from [[Scandinavia]] consisting of [[Frying|fried]] pork belly and generally served with [[potato]]es and [[parsley sauce]] (''persillesovs''). The dish is sometimes translated as '[[pork]] strips' or 'crisp fried pork slices'.<ref>Branislava Vladisavljevic [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dt7akbWvmSEC&pg=PA40&dq=Stegt+Fl%C3%A6sk+bacon Lonely Planet Western Europe Phrasebook] page 4 Lonely Planet Phrasebooks Edition: 4, illustrated Lonely Planet, 2007 {{ISBN|978-1-74104-059-3}}, 456 pages</ref><ref name="Lonely Plant">Andrew Stone, Carolyn Bain, Michael Booth, Fran Parnell [https://books.google.com/books?id=m_gT1lQpZEAC&pg=PA53&dq=Stegt+Fl%C3%A6sk#PPA53,M1] page 49 and page 53 Denmark Edition: 5, illustrated 2008, Lonely Planet {{ISBN|978-1-74104-669-4}}, 364 pages</ref> The [[pork belly]] or "breast" cut of a pig is used for ''stegt flæsk'' and the strips are cut about 1/4&nbsp;inch thick.

''Stegt flæsk'' is the national dish of Denmark<ref>Lars Dahlager [http://politiken.dk/mad/madnyt/ECE2459449/flaesk-er-hele-danmarks-nationalret/ Politiken], 20 November 2014</ref> and one of the country's most popular foodstuffs and has been described as "a dish of pork fat, and only pork fat, in parsley sauce."<ref name="Lonely Plant"/> An "alternative guide to Denmark" from the British broadcaster [[BBC]] described ''stegt flæsk med persillesovs'' as fried slices of pork with fat served with parsley sauce and boiled potatoes.<ref name="BBC">"And for those who haven't had enough of old Porky Pig, the Danes also like ''stegt medister'', a thick sausage with minced pig meat and fat, spices and chopped onion, fried on the frying pan. Figures for heart disease in Denmark were not available."

''Stegt'' means 'fried' and ''flæsk'' means 'strips of pork belly'. It is lightly salted but not smoked. ''Stegt flæsk'' is included in ''The Art of Danish Cooking'' by Nika Standen Hazelton and ''Scandinavian Cooking'' by Elizabeth Craig where the dish is translated as "bacon with parsley sauce"<ref>Nika Standen Hazelton The Art of Danish Cooking Page 123 1964 Doubleday 240 pages</ref><ref>Elizabeth Craig Scandinavian cooking 1958 Deutsch/ Indiana University 351 pages</ref> ''Flæsk'' is also translated as 'bacon' in older language guides.<ref>New Guide to Conversations in Danish and English 1882 246 pages</ref> The main difference between bacon and ''flæsk'' is that ''flæsk'' is never sold smoked, and often not salted either. By contrast, anything marketed as 'bacon' in Denmark invariably will be both smoked and salted.

The dish is especially popular at certain times of the year. Since the 2000s a tradition has emerged of eating ''stegt flæsk'' on election nights as a pun on the derogatory term ''valgflæsk'' (election pork) used to describe the lofty promises politicians make during their campaigns.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/penge/stegt-flaesk-den-foretrukne-valgmenu| title=Stegt flæsk den foretrukne valgmenu| publisher=[[DR (broadcaster)|DR]]| date=16 November 2007| accessdate=14 June 2025}}</ref> Stegt flæsk can also be served with apple [[compote]].<ref>[http://www.nordjyske.dk/livsstil/madogdrikke/morten-kok.aspx?ctrl=10&data=181%2C2223033%2C5%2C3 Stegt flæsk with apple compote] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106072048/http://www.nordjyske.dk/livsstil/madogdrikke/morten-kok.aspx?ctrl=10&data=181%2C2223033%2C5%2C3 |date=2009-01-06 }} January 19, 2007 Nordjyske</ref>

Pork is the most popular meat in Denmark and bacon and cuts of pork are used in many dishes in  traditional Danish cuisine. ''[[Flæskesteg]]'' is roast pork with [[Pork rind|cracklings]], usually served with ''rødkål'' red cabbage, gravy and boiled potatoes.<ref name="Lonely Plant"/> ''Flæskeæggekage'' consists of a large pan of [[scrambled eggs]] with ''stegt flæsk'', chives, tomatoes and ''rugbrød'' ryebread on the side.<ref name="Lonely Plant"/> ''[[Leverpostej]]'' is a liver pate of pork liver, served both hot and cold in a variety of ways.<ref name="BBC"/> ''[[Medisterpølse|Stegt medister]]'' is a thick, metre-long, spiced, minced pork [[sausage]] with lard and chopped onion, pan fried and served in a variety of ways.<ref name="BBC"/> The [[BBC]] noted that whilst Danish food is not limited to just pork meat and pastries, "it would be fair to say they feature heavily in the diets of Denmark's citizens".<ref name="BBC"/> An instructional video for cooking ''stegt flæsk'' on a ceramic grill was featured on Japanese [[Kamado|KamadoTV]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqocxvK_d_w KamadoTV stegt flaesk video]  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416071226/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqocxvK_d_w |date=2016-04-16 }}</ref>
