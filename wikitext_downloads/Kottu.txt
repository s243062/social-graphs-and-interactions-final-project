== History ==
[[File:Kottu.jpg|thumb|A dish of Kottu roti]]
The word ''koththu'' means "to chop", referring to its method of preparation,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/30/magazine/sri-lankan-kottu-roti-by-way-of-staten-island.html|title=Sri Lankan Kottu Roti, by Way of Staten Island|last=Lam|first=Francis|date=26 November 2014|website=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=25 April 2020}}</ref> as the ingredients are commonly chopped together using special [[cleaver]]s, whilst they [[Sautéing|sauté]] on a hot [[griddle]]. This has been simplified in Tamil and Sinhalese to Kothu or Kottu respectively. 

It is generally thought to have originated as [[street food]] in the eastern province of Sri Lanka in the 1960s/1970s, as an inexpensive meal for the lower socio-economic classes. The basic roti is made of [[Roti#Sri_Lanka Gothamba flour|Gothamba flour]], a wheat flour made out of a variety of grains-referring to the white flour,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.sundaytimes.lk/110821/Magazine/sundaytimesmirror_05.html|title=Roti hunt|first=Yashasvi|last=Kannangara|newspaper=[[Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)|Sunday Times]]|date=21 August 2011|access-date=3 November 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/food/article/2020/11/03/ultimate-guide-making-roti-home|title=Ultimate Guide to making Roti at home|publisher=SBS Television|date=2 November 2021|access-date=3 November 2022}}</ref> also known as wheat roti or gothamba/godamba roti in Sinhala and "veechu parotta", "veechu roti" in Tamil. 

Traditionally, kottu is made from recycling day-old godamba rotis, which are chopped up into small strips and mixed with an assortment of spices, fried vegetables, possibly egg or meat, and topped with chillies and onions. The old roti chunks were castoffs the bakers couldn’t sell, and an enterprising lower class took advantage of the inexpensive food source.<ref>https://southeastasiabackpacker.com/koththu-roti-sri-lanka/{{unreliable source|date=January 2024}}</ref>

==Preparation==

Eggs, cooked meat, or fish are added to fried vegetables and heated for a few minutes. Finally, the pieces of cut ''paratha'' are added. These are chopped and mixed by repeated pounding using heavy iron blades/spatula, the sound of which is very distinctive and can usually be heard from a long distance. Depending upon what ingredients are used, the variations are vegetable, egg, beef, chicken, mutton, and fish ''kottu roti''.<ref name="Briggs 2018 p. 54">{{cite book|last=Briggs|first=P.|title=Sri Lanka|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|series=Bradt Travel Guide.
