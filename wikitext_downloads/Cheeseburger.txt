A '''cheeseburger''' is a [[hamburger]] with one or more slices of melted [[cheese]] on top of the meat [[patty]], added near the end of the cooking time. Cheeseburgers can include variations in structure, ingredients and composition. As with other hamburgers, a cheeseburger may include various condiments and other toppings such as [[lettuce]], [[tomato]] and [[ketchup]].

In [[fast food restaurant]]s across the United States, [[processed cheese]] is usually used, although other meltable cheeses are used, such as [[Cheddar cheese|cheddar]], [[Swiss cheese (North America)|Swiss]], [[Mozzarella cheese|mozzarella]], [[blue cheese]], or [[pepper jack cheese|pepper jack]]. Virtually all restaurants that sell hamburgers also offer cheeseburgers.

==Origins==
By the late 19th century, the vast grasslands of the [[Great Plains]] had been opened up for cattle ranching. This made it possible for many Americans to consume beef almost daily. The hamburger remains as one of the cheapest forms of beef in America.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Hamburger: The History|last=Ozersky|first=Josh|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780300117585|location=New Haven Conn.|pages=[https://archive.org/details/hamburgerhistory0000ozer/page/12 12, 14]|url=https://archive.org/details/hamburgerhistory0000ozer/page/12}}</ref>

Adding cheese to hamburgers became popular in the 1920s. There are several competing claims as to who created the first cheeseburger. Lionel Sternberger is reputed to have introduced the cheeseburger in 1924 at the age of 16. He was working as a fry cook at his father's [[Pasadena, California]], sandwich shop, "The Rite Spot", and "experimentally dropped a slab of American cheese on a sizzling hamburger."<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.pasadena-chamber.org/blog/plaque-commemorating-invention-cheeseburger-pasadena-dedicated-la-financial-credit-union | title=Plaque commemorating invention of the cheeseburger in Pasadena dedicated at LA Financial Credit Union | website=Pasadena Chamber of Commerce }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/local/la-xpm-2012-jan-16-la-me-burger-claim-20120116-story.html |title=Pasadena claims its slice of burger history |last=Piasecki |first=Joe |date=January 16, 2012 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=October 15, 2017 |issn=0458-3035}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Harvey |title=Only in L.A. |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |page=B2 |date=March 27, 1991 |quote=Cooking at his father's short-order joint in Pasadena in the early 1920s, [Sternberger] experimentally tossed a slice (variety unknown) on a hamburger... |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-03-27-me-812-story.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Charles |last=Perry |title=It's an L.A.

Dale Mulder, the owner of an [[A&W Restaurants]] franchise in [[Lansing, Michigan]], has been credited with inventing the bacon cheeseburger in 1963, putting it on the menu after repeated requests from the same customer.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jason|first1=Jason|title=14 Things You Didn't Know About A&W Restaurants|url=https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/the-history-of-aw-restaurants-aw-root-beer|access-date=September 9, 2016|work=Thrillist|date=June 22, 2015}}</ref> This was highlighted in a 2014 ad campaign for the chain featuring Mulder, who had since become the president of the A&W chain.<ref>[https://adage.com/creativity/work/aw-presents-history-bacon-cheeseburger/36156 "You'll Never Guess Who Invented the Bacon Cheeseburger"], ''[[Ad Age]]'', June 23, 2014, Web.</ref> However, there are earlier examples of a restaurant selling bacon cheeseburgers, including a menu for a [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] restaurant from 1941.<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-evening-news/159195560/ "NEW—DIFFERENT; Announcing Opening of Hitchin' Post Restaurant"], ''[[Harrisburg Evening News]]'', January 3, 1941, page eight.

The [[steamed cheeseburger]], a variation almost exclusively served in central [[Connecticut]], is believed to have been invented at a restaurant called Jack's Lunch in Middletown, Connecticut, in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite book|author=George Motz|title=Hamburger America: Completely Revised and Updated Edition: A State-by-State Guide to 150 Great Burger Joints|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5-cSGkAv_L4C&pg=PT70|date=10 May 2011|publisher=Running Press|isbn=978-0-7624-4234-8|page=70}}</ref>

==Ingredients==
[[File:At Dot's Diner - Alpine Burger.jpg|thumb|Some cheeseburger ingredients]]
The ingredients used to create cheeseburgers follow similar patterns found in the regional variations of hamburgers, although most start with ground beef.  Common cheeses used for topping are [[American cheese|American]], [[Swiss cheese (North America)|Swiss]], [[Cheddar cheese|Cheddar]] and other meltable cheeses. Popular toppings include [[lettuce]], [[tomato]], [[onion]], [[pickled cucumber|pickles]], [[bacon]], [[avocado]] or [[guacamole]], sliced [[Sautéing|sautéed]] [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]], cheese sauce or [[Chili con carne|chili]], but the variety of possible toppings is broad.

A cheeseburger may have more than one [[patty]] or more than one slice of cheese—it is reasonably common, but by no means automatic, for the number to increase at the same rate with cheese and meat interleaved. A stack of two or more patties follows the same basic pattern as hamburgers: with two patties will be called a double cheeseburger; a triple cheeseburger has three, and while much less common, a quadruple has four.<ref>{{cite news |title=In-N-Out Burgers: With an emphasis on quality, this fast feeder shows its rare appeal.

Sometimes cheeseburgers are prepared with the cheese enclosed within the ground beef, rather than on top. This is sometimes known as a [[Jucy Lucy]].<ref name=mndaily>{{cite news |last1=Flower |first1=Justin |last2=Boller |first2=Jay |title=Burger Battle |url=http://www.mndaily.com/2008/03/13/burger-battle |work=[[Minnesota Daily]] |date=13 March 2008 |access-date=October 31, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710175218/http://www.mndaily.com/2008/03/13/burger-battle |archive-date=July 10, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Other toppings and condiments may include lettuce, tomato, [[onion]], [[pickled cucumber|pickles]], [[bacon]], [[avocado]], [[mushrooms]], [[mayonnaise]], ketchup, and [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]].
