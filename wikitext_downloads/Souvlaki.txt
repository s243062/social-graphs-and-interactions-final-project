==Etymology==
The word ''souvlaki'' is a [[diminutive]] of the [[Medieval Greek]] {{Transliteration|grc-x-medieval|soúvla}} ({{langx|grc-x-medieval|σούβλα||skewer|label=none}}) itself borrowed from Latin {{lang|la|subula}}.<ref>[[Georgios Babiniotis]], [[Babiniotis dictionary|Λεξικό της Νεας Ελληνικής Γλώσσας]], ''s.v.''; Andriotis et al., Λεξικό της Κοινής Νεοελληνικής, [http://www.greek-language.gr/greekLang/modern_greek/tools/lexica/triantafyllides/search.html?lq=%CF%83%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%B2%CE%BB%CE%AC%CE%BA%CE%B9 ''s.v.'' σουβλάκι], [http://www.greek-language.gr/greekLang/modern_greek/tools/lexica/triantafyllides/search.html?lq=%CF%83%CE%BF%CF%8D%CE%B2%CE%BB%CE%B1 ''s.v.'' σούβλα]</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Sophocles|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=k3YDBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1000 1000]}}.</ref> ''Souvlaki'' is the common term in [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and other regions of [[northern Greece]], while in [[southern Greece]] and around [[Athens, Greece|Athens]] it is commonly known as ''kalamaki'' ({{langx|el|καλαμάκι||small [[Phragmites|reed]]' or 'little straw|label=none}}).

==History==

In [[Culture of Greece|Greek culture]], the practice of cooking food on spits or [[skewer]]s dates to the [[Helladic chronology|Bronze Age]].<ref name=Hruby>{{harvnb|Hruby|2017|loc="Souvlaki trays", pp. 23–25}}.</ref> Excavations in [[Santorini]], [[Greece]], unearthed [[Fire dog|sets of stone cooking supports]] used by the natives of the island before the [[Thera eruption]] of the 17th century BC; souvlaki was "a popular delicacy in Santorini back in 2000 BC".<ref>{{cite web|last=Eptakili|first=Tassoula|title=Prehistoric Gastronomy: Dietary habits of a long-lost era|website=Greece Is|date=9 October 2015|access-date=21 February 2016|url=http://www.greece-is.com/prehistoric-gastronomy-2/}}</ref> In the stone cooking supports, there are pairs of indentations that were likely used for holding skewers and the line of holes in the base allowed the [[coals]] to be supplied with air.<ref>[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Akrotiri_terracotta_firedogs_with_zoomorphic_finials.jpg Utilitarian terracotta object, Museum of Cycladic Culture, Akrotiri excavation artifacts, Santorini, Cyclades, Hellas (Greece)].</ref>

In [[Mycenaean Greece]], "souvlaki trays" were discovered in [[Gla]], [[Mycenae]], and [[Pylos]].<ref name=Hruby/> The "souvlaki trays" (or portable grills) used by the Mycenaean Greeks were rectangular ceramic pans that sat underneath skewers of meat.<ref name=Hruby/> It is not clear whether these trays would have been placed directly over a fire or if the pans would have held hot coals like a portable barbecue pit.<ref name=Hruby/><ref>{{cite web|last=Gannon|first=Megan|title=Ancient Greeks Used Portable Grills at Their Picnics|website=Live Science|date=8 January 2014|access-date=5 February 2020|url=http://www.livescience.com/42414-ancient-cooking-mycenaeans-portable-grills.html}}</ref> Spit supports appear to "continue in use into the [[Archaic Greece|Early Iron Age]] at [[Nichoria]]".<ref name=Hruby/> In [[Greek literature]], [[Homer]] in the ''[[Iliad]]'' (1.465) mentions pieces of meat roasted on spits (ὀβελός); this is also mentioned in the works of [[Aristophanes]],<ref>Aristophanes.

In the [[Byzantine Empire]], the Greek author of the ''Prodromic Poems'' (4.231) mentions "the hot meat shops" of [[Constantinople]] providing clients with spit-roasting meat slices similar to souvlaki known as {{Transliteration|grc|psenasis souglitarea}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Dalby|2010|pp=70, 225}}.</ref>

Modern-day ''souvlaki'' was described by [[Gustave Flaubert]], a [[French people|French]] traveler, who observed Greeks "grilling pieces of meat on a bamboo stick" during his visit to the [[Boeotia]]n countryside of southern [[Central Greece (geographic region)|Central Greece]] in 1850.<ref name="Street Foods">{{harvnb|Matalas|Yannakoulia|2000|loc=p. 6 including footnote 8}}.</ref> However, modern-day souvlaki was not widely distributed in Greece until after [[World War II]].<ref name="Street Foods"/> Souvlaki skewers served as fast food started to be sold widely in the 1960s, after being introduced by vendors from Boeotia.<ref name="Street Foods"/> The first known use of the word ''souvlaki'' in [[English language|English]] was in 1942.<ref name="Webster">{{cite web|title=Souvlaki|website=[[Merriam-Webster]]|access-date=5 February 2020|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/souvlaki}}</ref>

===Kalamaki===
''Kalamaki'' ({{lang|el|καλαμάκι}} meaning "[[diminutive|small]] [[Reed (plant)|reed]]") is a synonym for souvlaki proper in [[Athens, Greece|Athens]] where the word ''souvlaki'' is used colloquially for any kind of pita wraps. Kalamaki can also be accompanied with vegetables such as tomato, peppers, and onions, and a sauce, with lemon wedges. There are some places in Greece where kalamaki is not connected in any way to souvlaki such as [[Thessaloniki]]; in these regions, souvlaki refers to the dish that in Athens is called kalamaki.

===Souvlaki-merida===
''Merída'' (μερίδα) means ''portion'' in Greek. While souvlaki is eaten plain as a fast food, it is also served as a full plate, served with fried potatoes, vegetables, sauce, and quartered [[pita]] bread. Usually it consists of the ingredients of a souvlaki-pita (see below) laid out on a plate. Pork is mostly used, but others can be used, such as chicken or lamb.

===Souvlaki pita===
Souvlaki-[[pita]] consists of grilled souvlaki meat folded in a lightly grilled pita along with sliced [[tomato]]es and [[onion]]s, and [[tzatziki]] sauce,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Skrapaliori-Graves |first=Jenny |date=2021-03-21 |title=Greek Souvlaki With Pita |url=https://thegreekfoodie.com/authentic-greek-souvlaki-with-pita-recipe/ |access-date=2024-08-19 |website=The Greek Foodie |language=en-US}}</ref> and [[french fries|fried potatoes]] on the side – though increasingly they may be added to the folded pita. This variation is prominent at outlets run by Melbourne's [[Greek-Australian]] community.

In some areas, when chicken is used instead of pork, tzatziki and onions are replaced with a special yellow mustard sauce and [[lettuce]].  Other garnishes and [[sauce]]s include [[ktipiti]], [[Russian salad]], and [[melitzanosalata]].

===Corfu===
In [[Corfu]], a special tomato sauce is added to souvlaki, plainly called "red sauce" ({{lang|el|κόκκινη σάλτσα}}).

===Cyprus===
{{Main|Sheftalia}}

In [[Cyprus]], souvlaki can refer both to the small chunks of meat on a skewer, and to the dish. It is made with a large pita that has a pocket-style opening. Into this is placed the meat (traditionally lamb or pork, more recently [[sheftalia]] or chicken), which in Cypriot souvlaki is cut into slightly larger chunks. Tomatoes, cucumbers and shredded white cabbage are the usual salad additions. [[Onion]], [[parsley]], and pickled green [[chili pepper]]s are common accompaniments, as are yogurt and tzatziki. Cut lemons are always included with souvlaki, as they are with all grilled meats in Cyprus. Lettuce is not traditional and is seldom used in souvlaki outside of tourist resorts.{{citation needed|date=September 2023}}
