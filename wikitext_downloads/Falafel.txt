'''Falafel''' ({{IPAc-en|f|ə|ˈ|l|ɑː|f|əl}} {{respell|fə|LAH|fəl}}; {{langx|ar|فلافل}}, {{IPA|ar|fæˈlæːfɪl|IPA|ArFalafel.ogg}}) is a [[Deep frying|deep-fried]] ball or patty-shaped [[fritter]] of [[Egyptian cuisine|Egyptian]] origin that features in [[Middle Eastern cuisine]], particularly [[Levantine cuisine]]s. It is made from ground [[Vicia faba|fava beans]], [[chickpea]]s, or both, and mixed with herbs and spices before frying.

Falafel is often served in a [[flatbread]] such as [[pita]], [[samoon]], [[laffa]], or [[Taboon bread|taboon]]; ''falafel'' also frequently refers to a wrapped sandwich that is prepared in this way. The falafel balls may be topped with [[salad]]s, [[Pickling|pickled]] vegetables, and [[hot sauce]], and drizzled with [[tahini]]-based sauces. Falafel balls may also be eaten alone as a snack or served as part of a [[meze]] tray.

Falafel is a popular [[street food]] eaten throughout the Middle East. In Egypt and the [[Arabian Peninsula]], it is most often made with fava beans, while in the [[Levant]], it is typically made with chickpeas or sometimes a blend of both.

The adoption of the Palestinian chickpea version of falafel into [[Israeli cuisine]] and its identification as Israeli is contentious, and has led to accusations of [[cultural appropriation]] and [[gastronationalism]].<ref name="Vered-20182">{{Cite news |last=Vered |first=Ronit |date=13 June 2018 |title=Israelis or Arabs – Who Owns Falafel - and Does It Matter? |url=https://www.haaretz.com/food/2018-06-13/ty-article-magazine/.premium/which-nation-owns-falafel-and-does-it-matter/0000017f-e498-d7b2-a77f-e79f24d30000 |access-date=2023-12-12 |work=[[Haaretz]] |language=en}}</ref>

==Etymology==

The word {{transliteration|ar|falāfil}} ({{langx|ar|فلافل}}) is Arabic and is the plural of {{transliteration|ar|ALA-LC|filfil}} ({{lang|ar|[[wikt:فلفل|فلفل]]}}) 'pepper',<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=[[American Heritage Dictionary]]|edition=5th|year=2011|title=falafel|url=http://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=falafel&submit.x=38&submit.y=12}}</ref> borrowed from [[Persian language|Persian]] {{transliteration|fa|felfel}} ({{lang|fa|فلفل}}),<ref>{{Cite web|title=دیکشنری آنلاین - Dehkhoda dictionary - معنی پلپل|url=https://abadis.ir/?lntype=dehkhoda,fatofa,moeen,amid,name,wiki,wikiislamic&word=%D9%BE%D9%84%D9%BE%D9%84&from=ac|access-date=2021-01-06|website=abadis.ir|archive-date=6 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210306165047/https://abadis.ir/?lntype=dehkhoda,fatofa,moeen,amid,name,wiki,wikiislamic&word=%D9%BE%D9%84%D9%BE%D9%84&from=ac|url-status=live}}</ref> cognate with the [[Sanskrit]] word {{transliteration|sa|pippalī}} ({{lang|sa|पिप्पली}}) 'long pepper'; or an earlier {{transliteration|arc|*filfal}}, from Aramaic {{transliteration|arc|pilpāl}} 'small round thing, peppercorn', derived from ''palpēl'' 'to be round, roll'.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Definition of falafel {{!}} Dictionary.com|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/falafel|access-date=2021-01-03|website=www.dictionary.com|language=en|archive-date=6 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190106204535/https://www.dictionary.com/browse/falafel|url-status=live}}</ref>

The name {{transliteration|ar|falāfil}} is used world-wide. In English (where it has been written ''falafel'', ''felafel'', ''filafel'' and ''filafil''), it is first attested in 1936.<ref>The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (3rd ed., March 2022) has a [https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/69033 1936 citation].</ref>

Falafel is known as {{transliteration|arz|ṭaʿmiyya}} ({{langx|ar|طعمية|links=no}}, {{IPA|arz|tˤɑʕˈmejjɑ|IPA}}) in Egypt and Sudan. The word is derived from a [[diminutive]] form of the Arabic word {{transliteration|ar|ALA-LC|ṭaʿām}} ({{lang|ar|طعام}}, 'food'); the particular form indicates a "unit" of the given [[Semitic root|root]] in this case {{transliteration|sem|Ṭ-ʕ-M}} ({{lang|ar|ط ع م}}, having to do with taste and food), thus meaning 'a little piece of food' or 'small tasty thing'.<ref name="Oxford Press">{{cite book|last=Davidson|first=Alan|author2=Jaine, Tom|title=The Oxford Companion to Food|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|edition=2nd|page=287|isbn=978-0-19-280681-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JTr-ouCbL2AC&q=falafel&pg=PA287|access-date=April 27, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Vegetarian Journal 2001-04-01" /><ref>{{cite book|last=Ham|first=Anthony|title=Africa|year=2010|publisher=Lonely Planet|location=Footscray, Victoria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n-jEEqvIqi4C&pg=PA199|page=199|isbn=978-1-74104-988-6|access-date=July 19, 2011}}</ref>

The word ''falafel'' can refer to the fritters themselves or to sandwiches filled with them.

=== Europe ===
Waves of migration of Arabs and Turks took falafel through Europe to [[Germany]] in particular, where a large Turkish population had put down roots. At first it was a dish consumed principally by migrants. During the early 1970s, the appearance of Turkish food stalls and restaurants made falafel available to the Germans, resulting in a transformation of the recipe.<ref name="Lee 2019" />

==Preparation and variations==

Falafel is made from [[Vicia faba|fava beans]], [[chickpea]]s, or a combination of both.{{sfn|Raviv|2003|p=20}} In Egypt, it is typically prepared with fava beans. In Israeli and Palestinian cuisine, chickpeas are commonly used,{{sfn|Raviv|2003|p=20}} while in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and the wider Middle East, either chickpeas or a mix of both are used.{{sfn|Roden|2008|p=62}}{{sfn|Raviv|2003|p=20}}{{sfn|Malouf|Malouf|2008|p=90}}<ref name="Aytop106">{{cite book|title=The glutton's glossary: a dictionary of food and drink terms|first=John|last=Ayto|publisher=Routledge|year=1990|access-date=6 February 2011|isbn=0-415-02647-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vAQOAAAAQAAJ&q=syria+falafel+chickpeas&pg=PA106}}</ref> The chickpea-based version is the most popular in the West.{{sfn|Roden|2008|p=62}}

When chickpeas are used, they are not cooked prior to use (cooking the chickpeas will cause the falafel to fall apart, requiring adding some flour to use as a binder). Instead they are soaked (sometimes with [[Sodium bicarbonate|baking soda]]) overnight, then ground together with various ingredients such as parsley, [[scallion]]s, and garlic.{{sfn|Roden|2008|p=62}} Spices such as [[cumin]] and [[coriander]] are often added to the beans for added flavor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E7D81F30F937A35757C0A9619C8B63|title=For the Best Falafel, Do It All Yourself|last=Bittman|first=Mark|date=4 April 2007|work=The New York Times|access-date=11 July 2011|archive-date=12 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612120635/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E7D81F30F937A35757C0A9619C8B63|url-status=live}}</ref> The dried fava beans are soaked in water and then stone ground with leek, parsley, green coriander, cumin and dry coriander.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.scienzavegetariana.it/nutrizione/favabeans.html | title=Fava Beans, Levodopa, and Parkinson's Disease | author=Kathrynne Holden | access-date=17 March 2013 | archive-date=22 July 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180722191415/https://www.scienzavegetariana.it/nutrizione/favabeans.html | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19960529/LIFE/305299944 | author=Russ Parsons | title=The Long History of the Mysterious Fava Bean | access-date=10 August 2014 | archive-date=29 October 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201029223716/https://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19960529/LIFE/305299944 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The mixture is shaped into balls or patties.

Falafel is typically ball-shaped, but is sometimes made in other shapes. The inside of falafel may be green (from green herbs such as parsley or green onion), or tan. Sometimes sesame seeds are added on top of the falafel before frying it.
