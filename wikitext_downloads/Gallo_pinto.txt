'''{{lang|es|Gallo pinto}}''' or '''{{lang|es|gallopinto}}''' is a traditional [[Rice and beans#International dishes and variations|rice and bean]] dish from [[Central America]].  Consisting of [[rice and beans]] as a base, gallo pinto is important to both [[Nicaragua]] and [[Costa Rica]], both of which consider it a national dish. 

The beans in gallo pinto are cooked with [[garlic]], [[oregano]] and [[onion]]. When the bean juice is in equal parts with the red beans, they are then combined with leftover or previously prepared rice. The rice in the Nicaraguan version is prepared with salt and onions.  <ref>{{Cite web |last=Cuisine |first=Darlene at International |date=2017-08-17 |title=Nicaraguan Gallo Pinto ( Rice and Beans) |url=https://www.internationalcuisine.com/nicaraguan-gallo-pinto/ |access-date=2025-09-30 |website=International Cuisine |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Gallo pinto means 'spotted rooster' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The name is said to originate in the multi-colored or speckled appearance that results from cooking the rice with black or red beans.<ref name="Ray-2023">{{Cite web |last=Ray |first=Ranita |date=30 January 2023 |title=Gallo Pinto, A Famed Vegetarian Dish!

== History ==

It is uncertain and disputed which country is the precise origin of the dish.<ref name="AmericanFolklore">{{Cite journal |last=Preston-Werner |first=Theresa |date=2020-07-10 |title=Gallo Pinto: Tradition, Memory, and Identity in Costa Rican Foodways |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/256967 |journal=[[Journal of American Folklore]] |volume=122}}</ref> Both [[Nicaragua]] and [[Costa Rica]] claim it as their own, and its origin is a controversial subject between the two countries.<ref name="Parker-2017" /><ref name="Ray-2023" /> There is general agreement that the dish's origins are [[Afro-Caribbean people|Afro-Caribbean]].<ref name="Parker-2017">{{Cite web |last=Parker |first=Jenn |date=2017-11-07 |title=Costa Rica Vs Nicaragua: Who Really Invented Gallo Pinto? |url=https://theculturetrip.com/north-america/costa-rica/articles/costa-rica-vs-nicaragua-who-really-invented-gallo-pinto |access-date=2025-03-27 |website=[[Culture Trip]] |language=en}}</ref> The dish is mentioned in [[Carlos Luis Fallas]]' ''[[Mamita Yunai]]'', which describes Costa Ricans and Nicaraguans working together on banana plantations encountering the dish and eventually taking it back home.<ref name="Parker-2017" /> According to anthropologist Teresa Preston-Werner, Fallas' "inclusion of pinto in the cultural landscape of the Caribbean coast demonstrates the meal’s ubiquity in daily life as early as the first part of the twentieth century".<ref name="AmericanFolklore" />

In Costa Rica, the dish has an origin story involving a farmer in San Jose's San Sebastian neighborhood who told his friends and neighbors he was going to slaughter a speckled hen or gallo pinto for a feast day celebration for Saint Sebastian; when the people he had told interpreted this as an invitation to dinner, the hen wasn't enough to feed everyone, and he served rice and beans. It turned into a local joke, with people asking one another whether they'd gotten any of the farmer's gallo pinto, and the name for the dish spread throughout the country.<ref name="AmericanFolklore" /> Preston-Werner writes that the truth of the origin story is less important than the fact that it "provides a crucial cultural explanation for the origin of this ubiquitous food. In the case of pinto, a culturally adored foodway becomes grounded in time (the start of the twentieth century on the day of Saint Sebastián) and space (the town of San Sebastián by the Tiribi River)".<ref name="AmericanFolklore" />
