'''Layered rye bread''' ({{langx|lv|rupjmaizes kārtojums}}) is a traditional [[Cuisine of Latvia|Latvian]] [[dessert]] made from [[rupjmaize|rye]] breadcrumbs, [[blackcurrant]] or [[lingonberry jam]], and [[whipped cream]]. It is topped off with grated [[dark chocolate]] and/or [[cinnamon]] and often served with fresh berries and [[cottage cheese]] ice cream.<ref name="Ceļotājs"/>

Layered rye bread is similar in appearance and construction to the [[trifle]] of the [[British Isles]], and is sometimes called '''rye bread trifle''' or '''Latvian ambrosia'''. Layered rye bread is an iconic Latvian food, and is considered one of the national dishes. It was the sweet chosen to represent Latvia in the [[Café Europe]] initiative of the Austrian presidency of the European Union, on Europe Day 2006.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cafeeurope.at/sweet.htm |title=Sweet Europe |publisher=[[Institute of the Regions of Europe]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524233700/http://www.cafeeurope.at/sweet.htm |access-date=March 5, 2010|archive-date=2006-05-24 }}</ref>

==Preparation==
Layered rye bread is prepared in a clear glass, [[trifle]] dish or [[parfait glass]] by first spreading a thin layer of [[jam]] or [[Fruit preserves|preserves]] on the bottom of the dish, then adding a thick layer of lightly sweetened vanilla-flavoured [[whipped cream]] or [[Mascarpone]], which is then in turn sprinkled with a layer of dark rye bread crumbs. These layers are repeated up to the top of the dish when a final dollop of cream and sprinkling of the rye crumbs are added to enhance the dessert's appearance.

An authentic layered rye bread is made from the traditional Latvian dark rye bread made entirely from rye flour. The bread is finely grated and pan-toasted in case it's not already dried. The breadcrumbs are then flavoured with [[cinnamon]] and sugar.<ref>{{cite book |title=Sweet Treats around the World: An Encyclopedia of Food and Culture |first1=Timothy G. |last1=Roufs |first2=Kathleen Smyth |last2=Roufs |page=393 |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-61069-220-5}}</ref> [[Borodinsky bread]], and failing this, a dark [[pumpernickel]], are sometimes used as a substitute in preparing this dessert when Latvian bread is not available.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rozentāle |first=Cori |url=http://kitchenmouse.rozentali.com/2009/07/rupjmaizes-kartojums-sweetened-rye-trifle/ |title=Rupjmaizes kārtojums (Sweetened Rye Trifle) |date=July 31, 2009 |publisher=The Kitchen Mouse |access-date=March 5, 2010}}</ref> In a variation of the dessert the bread is soaked in [[brandy]].<ref>{{cite book  |title=Sweet Treats around the World: An Encyclopedia of Food and Culture |first1=Timothy G. |last1=Roufs |first2=Kathleen Smyth |last2=Roufs |page=31 |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-61069-220-5}}</ref>

Raspberry, strawberry and apricot are favourite preserves for preparing layered rye bread among Latvians, as are the more peculiarly Latvian [[aronia]], [[sea buckthorn]], [[lingonberry]], [[rose hip]] and [[Ribes rubrum|red currant]] varieties.

After preparing the dessert it is chilled thoroughly, since, over the course of several hours, the flavours of the individual ingredients meld, the rye crumbs soften and absorb fruit and cream liquids, and the dessert acquires a more cohesive texture. Fresh fruit is often added to the top of the dessert as a festive garnish to match or complement the jam variety used just before serving the dish.
