'''Ostkaka''' (pronounced oost-kah-kah),  {{Lang|sv|ost}} meaning "cheese" and {{Lang|sv|kaka}} meaning "cake" in Swedish, is known as '''Swedish cheesecake''' or '''Swedish curd cake''', it is a [[Swedish cuisine|Swedish]] sweet [[dessert]] that has its roots in two different parts of Sweden, [[Hälsingland]] and [[Småland]], though there are some differences between ostkaka from Hälsingland resembling [[halloumi]] in texture,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ica.se/FrontServlet?s=mat_recept&state=recept&receptid=5380|title=Mat, recept & smarta tjänster för en enklare vardag - ICA.se|work=ICA.se|access-date=8 December 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213142957/http://www.ica.se/FrontServlet?s=mat_recept|archive-date=13 December 2009}}</ref> and the soft-grained ostkaka from Småland.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.frodinge.se/index.asp?avd=produkter&sub=Ostkaka. |title=Frödinge Mejeri<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2008-10-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612065639/http://www.frodinge.se/index.asp?avd=produkter |archive-date=2008-06-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Traditionally ostkaka is made with raw milk and cheese rennet. Ostaka is one of the unofficial [[national dish]]es in Sweden.

Ostkaka is known nationwide in Sweden and pre-baked ostkaka can be found in grocery stores in Sweden, but ostkaka is particularly popular in the regions of Hälsingland and Småland.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ostkaka (Swedish cheesecake) |url=https://levandekulturarv.se/in-english/the-inventory/submissions/ostkaka-swedish-cheesecake |publisher=levandekulturarv.se |access-date=19 July 2025}}</ref> The world championship in ostkaka is being held in Hälsingland. In Hälsingland it's sometimes eaten during the [[Midsummer|Midsummer celebrations]] and in Småland sometimes during Christmas and local [[potluck]]s.

The ostkaka is crustless and commonly enjoyed lukewarm, paired with a cool jam, a fruit sauce or mixed berries, usually containing like [[cloudberry]] ([[mylta]]) or [[Prunus cerasus|cherries]], [[raspberry]], [[strawberry]], or [[lingonberry]], and poured or whipped [[cream]] or vanilla [[ice cream]]. The Hälsinge ostkaka is quite smooth, sliced and sometimes a bit squeaky.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ostkaka serveras under Hälsingegårdsdagarna |url=https://www.ljusnan.se/2016-05-25/ostkaka-serveras-under-halsingegardsdagarna |access-date=19 July 2025 |work=Ljusnan |language=Swedish}}</ref> The Småland ostkaka has a grainy or lumpy texture.

Despite the similarity in literal translation, ostkaka should not be confused with [[cheesecake]]. Swedes commonly refer to the latter using its English name, occasionally dubbing it "American cheesecake", to prevent misunderstanding. Nevertheless, Scandinavian restaurant menus occasionally mix up the two.

Similar curd cake recipes are also found in America and Russia, often under the name "Angel Tears" curd cake.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.megaladys.com/1294-tvorozhnyy-tort-8220slezy-angela8221-neobyknovenno-nezhnyy-desert.html |title=Curd cake "Angel Tears": unusually delicate dessert |access-date=2017-09-15 |archive-date=2019-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190711151110/http://www.megaladys.com/1294-tvorozhnyy-tort-8220slezy-angela8221-neobyknovenno-nezhnyy-desert.html |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.oren.aif.ru/food/kitchen1/1325361 Творожный пай «Слезы ангела»]</ref>

==Recipes==
Ostkaka is traditionally produced by adding [[rennet]] to a warm milk and flour mixture and letting the [[casein]] coagulate.
It is then baked in an oven, and gently reheated before serving. It should be served lukewarm - never hot, as this will nullify some of its flavor.<ref>{{usurped|1=[https://web.archive.org/web/20040103164000/http://hem.passagen.se/lenjoh/efter/ostkaka1.htm Äkta småländsk ostkaka<!-- Bot generated title -->]}}</ref>

===Simplified recipes===
Since the process of curdling milk is somewhat complicated, alternative recipes intended for home cooking instead use [[cottage cheese]] as a base to simulate the texture of the dessert.

===Hälsingeostkaka===
This is only made with the base ingredients, with local variations being some cream or sugar added, but regardless less sweet than the other kind.
The press-strained curd is further pressed into a baking dish and baked at medium heat until fully set. Whether it should receive a fine coat of saffron or not is still up for heated debate.

When cold, it can be stored until serving, at which time it is sliced and reheated in the oven in a bath of cream until it just begins to boil. By the time it is served, the heat should have evened out through the dish to perfect temperature.

===Smålandsostkaka===
[[Cream]], [[sugar]], [[Egg (food)|eggs]], [[almonds]] and [[bitter almond]] are added to the curd, which is strained but not pressed, to create a batter that then is poured into the baking dish.

Originally, the Småland variety is cooked in a large copper pot with a thin layer of protecting tin. A legend tells that guests were only allowed to take their portions from the centre of the ostkaka, thereby avoiding the most traces of the copper that may have leached from the borders. Said as often is that the centre is the creamiest and most succulent, and thus more suited to offer the guests. The rest was saved for the servants and children. Either way, the dish is baked to the consistency of scrambled eggs before taken out.

==National Day==
Since 2004, the "Day of Ostkaka" is occurs on November 14 in Sweden.<ref>[http://www.frodinge.se/index.asp?avd=ostkakansdag Ostkakans Dag 14 november - Frödinge Mejeri<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612065630/http://www.frodinge.se/index.asp?avd=ostkakansdag |date=2008-06-12 }}</ref> It was established and is promoted by Ostkakans vänner ("Friends of Ostkaka"),<ref>[http://ostkakansvanner.se/ Startsidan - Ostkakans vänner<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> a non-profit organization founded in 2003.
