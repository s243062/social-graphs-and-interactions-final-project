'''Bobotie''' ({{IPA|af|bəˈbuəti|audio=LL-Q14196 (afr)-Oesjaar-bobotie.wav}}) is a South African dish consisting of spiced [[ground meat|minced meat]] baked with an egg-based topping.<ref name="Times" />

==Origin of name and recipe==
Bobotie appears to be a variant of ''patinam ex lacte'', a dish documented by the ancient Roman writer [[Apicius]] consisting of layers of cooked meat, pine nuts, and seasoned with pepper, [[celery]] seeds and [[asafoetida]]. These were cooked until the flavours had blended, when a top layer of egg and milk was added. When the latter had set, the dish was ready to be served.<ref>Claassens, H.W., Die Geskiedenis van Boerekos 1652-1806, unpublished D.Phil. thesis, University of Pretoria, 2003, pp. 195–6.</ref> [[C. Louis Leipoldt]], a South African writer and gourmet, wrote that the recipe was known in Europe in the seventeenth century.<ref>C. Louis Leipoldt, Leipoldt's Cape Cookery, Cape Town, 1976, p. 16.</ref>

The origin of the word ''bobotie'' is contentious. The Afrikaans etymological dictionary claims that the probable origin is the Malayan word ''[[Bumbu (seasoning)|boemboe]]'', meaning curry spices.<ref>Etimologiewoordeboek van Afrikaans, WAT, 2003, p. 58.</ref> Others think it to have originated from ''[[bobotok]]'',<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hoogervorst|first=Tom |date=Dec 2018|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/itinerario/article/sailors-tailors-cooks-and-crooks-on-loanwords-and-neglected-lives-in-indian-ocean-ports/442E3D4F7E58EFBB54C935A8064D2F92 |title=Sailors, Tailors, Cooks, and Crooks: On Loanwords and Neglected Lives in Indian Ocean Ports|journal=Itinerario|publisher=Research Institute for History, Leiden University|volume=42|issue=3|page=532|doi=10.1017/S0165115318000645|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name="JPBobotie">{{cite news | title =Bobotie's melting pot | author =Theodora Hurustiati | date =10 November 2013 | newspaper =The Jakarta Post | url =http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/11/10/bobotie-s-melting-pot.html | access-date =12 May 2015 | archive-date =18 May 2015 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150518093916/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/11/10/bobotie-s-melting-pot.html | url-status =live }}</ref> an Indonesian dish which consisted of totally different ingredients.<ref name="Smit, S. 1983">Smit, S., and Fulton, M.

==Preparation==

Today, bobotie is much more likely to be made with beef or [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], although pork can also be used. Early recipes incorporated [[ginger]], [[marjoram]] and [[lemon]] rind; the introduction of [[curry powder]] has simplified the recipe but the basic concept remains the same. Some recipes also call for chopped onions and [[almond]]s to be added to the mixture. Traditionally, bobotie incorporates [[dried fruit]] like [[raisin]]s or [[sultana (grape)|sultana]]s. It is often garnished with [[bay leaves]], walnuts, [[chutney]] and [[banana]]s.<ref>[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=9&click_id=247&art_id=qw1014898861822C432&page_number=1 "Bobotie, a local and international winner" – Independent Online]</ref> Although not particularly spicy, the dish incorporates a variety of flavours that can add complexity. For example, the dried fruit (usually [[apricot]]s and raisins or sultanas) contrasts the curry flavouring. The texture of the dish is also complex, the baked egg mixture topping complementing the milk-soaked bread which adds moisture to the dish. Bobotie is usually served with "yellow rice", which is rice cooked with [[turmeric]].{{Cn|date=February 2025}}

===Leipoldt's recipe===
Leipoldt's recipe book published in 1933 calls for finely minced meat, breadcrumbs, milk, onions and butter and a curry sauce made with spices, sugar, lemon juice, chilli pepper and vinegar. This is baked with a topping of egg and milk.<ref>Leipoldt, C. Louis, Kos vir die Kenner, Human & Rossouw, 2011, p. 253.</ref>

===Tulleken's recipe===
A 1923 recipe by Mrs S. van H. Tulleken uses mutton, almonds, bitter almond essence, onions, butter, bread, curry powder, lemon juice, eggs and sugar, baked with a custard topping of eggs and milk.<ref>Tulleken, S. van H.,  The Practical Cookery Book for South Africa, 22nd edition, 1947, p. 133.</ref>

==Bobotie elsewhere in Africa==
Bobotie recipes were transported by [[Afrikaaners|South African settlers]] to other parts of Africa. Today, recipes for it can be found that originated in Afrikaner-descended settler communities in [[Botswana]], [[Kenya]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. There is a variation that was popular among the 7,000 [[Boer]] settlers who settled in the [[Chubut River]] Valley in [[Argentina]] in the early 20th century, in which the bobotie mixture is packed inside a large pumpkin, which is then baked until tender.{{Cn|date=February 2025}}

Bobotie was selected by [[2008 Masters Tournament|2008 Masters]] golf champion and South African native [[Trevor Immelman]] as the featured menu item for [[Augusta National Golf Club|Augusta National]]'s annual "Champions Dinner"  in April 2009. Each year, the reigning champion at The Masters golf tournament, played every year in [[Augusta, Georgia]], hosts the gathering and tends to create a menu featuring specialties from his home region.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/a/champdinner.htm |title="On the Menu: The Champions Dinner at The Masters" – About.com |access-date=13 April 2009 |archive-date=11 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411154938/http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/a/champdinner.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>
