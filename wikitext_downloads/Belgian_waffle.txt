In [[English-speaking world|English-speaking countries]], '''Belgian waffles''' are a variety of [[waffle]] with a lighter batter, larger squares, and deeper pockets than North American waffles. Belgian waffles were originally leavened with [[Baker's yeast|yeast]], but [[baking powder]] is now often used. They are often eaten as a [[breakfast]] food; toppings vary from whipped cream, confectioners' sugar, soft fruit, and [[chocolate]] spread, to syrup and butter or [[margarine]]. They may also be served with vanilla ice cream and fresh fruit (such as strawberries) as a [[dessert]].

In [[Belgium]] itself, there are several kinds of waffles, including the [[Waffle#Varieties|Brussels waffle]] and the [[Liège waffle]].
