There are several theories for the origin of this pastry, but in modern times, it is a common dessert among cuisines of countries in [[West Asia]], [[Southeast Europe]], [[Central Asia]], and [[North Africa]]. It is also enjoyed in [[South Asia]], where, although not a traditional sweet, it has become popular over the years.

==Etymology==
The word ''baklava'' is first attested in English in 1650,<ref>{{cite OED|baklava|9163123493}}</ref> a borrowing from {{langx|ota|باقلاوه}} {{IPA|/bɑːklɑvɑː/}}.<ref>{{cite Merriam-Webster|baklava }}</ref><ref name="dict">{{cite Dictionary.com|baklava }}</ref> The name ''baklava'' is used in many languages with minor phonetic and spelling variations.

There are also some similarities between baklava and the [[Ancient Greek cuisine|Ancient Greek]] desserts {{lang|grc-Latn|gastris}} ({{lang|grc|γάστρις}}),<ref>[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dga%2Fstris γάστρις] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210225070801/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dga%2Fstris |date=2021-02-25 }}, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> {{lang|grc-Latn|kopte sesamis}} ({{lang|grc|κοπτὴ σησαμίς}}), and {{lang|grc-Latn|kopton}} ({{lang|grc|κοπτόν}}) found in book XIV of the {{lang|el-Latn|[[Deipnosophistae]]}}.<ref>[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkopto%2Fs κοπτός] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210224142408/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkopto%2Fs |date=2021-02-24 }}, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref><ref>{{lang|el-Latn|[[Deipnosophists]]}} '''14''':647, discussed by Charles Perry, "The Taste for Layered Bread among the Nomadic Turks and the Central Asian Origins of Baklava", in ''A Taste of Thyme: Culinary Cultures of the Middle East'' (ed.

Another recipe for a similar dessert is {{lang|tr|[[güllaç]]}}, a dessert found in [[Turkish cuisine]] and considered by some as the origin of baklava.<ref name=Husihui>{{cite book |title=A soup for the Qan: Chinese dietary medicine of the Mongol era as seen in Hu Szu-Hui's Yin-shan cheng-yao |year=2010 |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |isbn=978-90-04-18020-8 |author=Husihui |edition=2nd rev. and expanded |author2=Paul D.

===Placenta cake theory===
Many claim that the [[placenta cake]], and therefore likely baklava, derived from a recipe from [[Ancient Greece]].<ref name="Mayer-1989">{{cite news |last=Mayer |first=Caroline E. |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/food/1989/05/03/phyllo-facts/1ca7102a-fb19-4abe-af8d-2cb17f49b98b/?noredirect=on |title=Phyllo Facts |newspaper=Washington Post |year=1989 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191229205837/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/food/1989/05/03/phyllo-facts/1ca7102a-fb19-4abe-af8d-2cb17f49b98b/?noredirect=on |archive-date=2019-12-29}}</ref> Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', written around 800 BC, mentions thin breads sweetened with walnuts and honey.<ref name="Mayer-1989"/> In the fifth century BC, [[Philoxenus of Cythera|Philoxenos]] states in his poem "Dinner" that, in the final drinking course of a meal, hosts would prepare and serve cheesecake made with milk and honey that was baked into a pie.<ref>Hoffman, Susanna.

The word "placenta" originally comes from the Greek language {{lang|grc-Latn|plakous}} ({{lang|grc|πλακοῦς}}), which means something "flat and broad".<ref name="Salaman2">[{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=jYa3J6xrjt4C |page=184 }} Rena Salaman, "Food in Motion the Migration of Foodstuffs and Cookery Techniques" from the Oxford Symposium on Food Cookery, Vol. 2, p. 184]</ref><ref>[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dplacenta placenta] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210307120657/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dplacenta|date=2021-03-07}}, Charlton T.

He praises the ''plakous'' made in Athens because it was soaked in Attic honey from the thyme-covered slopes of Mount Hymettos. His contemporary, the comic poet Antiphanes, tells us the other main ingredients, goat’s cheese and wheat flour. Two centuries later, in Italy, Cato gives an elaborate recipe for placenta (the same name transcribed into Latin), redolent of honey and cheese. The modern Romanian ''plăcintă'' and the Viennese ''Palatschinke'', though now quite different from their ancient Greek and Roman ancestor, still bear the same name."}}</ref> [[Antiphanes (comic poet)|Antiphanes]], a contemporary of [[Archestratus|Archestratos]], provided an ornate description of ''plakous'':<ref name="Goldstein" /><ref>{{harvnb|Dalby|1998|loc=p. 155: "Placenta is a Greek word (plakounta, accusative form of plakous 'cake').}}</ref>

Historian [[Andrew Dalby]] speculates as to why Cato's section on bread and cakes, which he describes as "recipes in a Greek tradition", are included in {{lang|la|[[De Agricultura]]}}: "Possibly Cato included them so that the owner and guests might be entertained when visiting the farm; possibly so that proper offerings might be made to the gods; more likely, I believe, so that profitable sales might be made at a neighbouring market."<ref name="Dalby21">{{harvnb|Dalby|1998|p=21}}</ref>

Cato's original recipe for placenta follows:

{{blockquote|Shape the placenta as follows: place a single row of {{lang|grc-Latn|[[Tracta (dough)|tracta]]}} along the whole length of the base dough. This is then covered with the mixture [cheese and honey] from the mortar. Place another row of {{lang|grc-Latn|tracta}} on top and go on doing so until all the cheese and honey have been used up. Finish with a layer of {{lang|grc-Latn|tracta}}. ... place the placenta in the oven and put a preheated lid on top of it ... When ready, honey is poured over the placenta.|author=Cato the Elder|source=''[[De Agri Cultura]]'' 160&nbsp;BC<ref name="faas"/>}}

Written in 1226 in today's [[Iraq]], the cookbook was based on an earlier collection of 9th century [[Persian cuisine|Persian]]-inspired recipes.<ref name="marks"/> According to [[Gil Marks]], Middle Eastern pastry makers later developed the process of layering the ingredients.<ref name=marks/>

==Preparation==

[[File:Baklava - Turkish special, 80-ply.JPEG|thumb|Baklava cut in a lozenge shape]]

Baklava is normally prepared in large pans. Many layers of [[filo]] dough,<ref>{{Google books |plainurl= |id=DOJMAgAAQBAJ |page=111 |title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America }}</ref> separated with melted butter and vegetable oil, are laid in the pan. A layer of chopped nuts—typically [[walnut]]s or [[pistachio]]s, but [[hazelnut]]s and [[almond]]s are also sometimes used—is placed on top, then more layers of filo. Most recipes have multiple layers of filo and nuts, though some have only top and bottom pastry.{{Cn|date=March 2025}}

Before baking, the dough is cut into regular pieces, often parallelograms (lozenge-shaped), triangles, diamonds or rectangles. After baking, a [[syrup]], which may include [[honey]], [[rosewater]], or [[orange flower water]], is poured over the cooked baklava and allowed to soak.{{Cn|date=March 2025}}

Baklava is usually served at room temperature, and is often garnished with nuts that have been ground up.{{Cn|date=March 2025}}

==Regional variations==

===Algeria===
[[Algerian baklawa|Baklava in Algeria]] is called ''Baklawa'' ([[Arabic]]: بقلاوة, [[Tifinagh]]: ⴱⴰⴽⵍⴰⴹⴰ). In most Algerian regions, Baklava is the centerpiece of any sweets table. This type of Baklava originates in the [[Algeria|Algerian]] city of [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]]. The Algerian Baklava is distinct in that [[Filo|filo dough]] is not used. Instead, they use another type of thin dough called [[malsouka]] or warqa and instead of walnuts or pistachios they use [[almond]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Wagda |first=Marin |date=2004 |title=Bricks en vrac à l'est d'Ithaque |url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/homig_1142-852x_2004_num_1251_1_4253 |journal=Hommes & Migrations |volume=1251 |issue=1 |pages=136–139 |doi=10.3406/homig.2004.4253}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bakhaï |first=Fatima |date=1996 |title=Dounia |url=https://www.torrossa.com/en/resources/an/5093106?digital=true |journal=Dounia |language=en |pages=1–302}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Bouayed|first=Fatima-Zohra|date=1970|title=La cuisine algérienne|url=https://www.abebooks.com/cuisine-alg%C3%A9rienne-Bouayed-Fatima-Zohra-Temps-Actuels/31073983930/bd|access-date=2022-01-31|website=www.abebooks.com|language=french|archive-date=2022-01-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220130072632/https://www.abebooks.com/cuisine-alg%C3%A9rienne-Bouayed-Fatima-Zohra-Temps-Actuels/31073983930/bd|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Petrick |first=G.

Baklava also exists in [[Romanian cuisine]], being known as {{lang|ro|baclava}} in Romanian. It is one of the most preferred desserts among Romanians together with ''[[kanafeh]]'' ({{lang|ro|cataif}}) and {{lang|ro|sarailia}}. In [[Romania]], some [[Turks of Romania|Turkish]] pastry shops that sell baklava have notable popularity. They are common in the south and southeast of the country, but some also exist in its east.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/64667189/ITEMA_2019-DRAFT-Conference-Proceedings.pdf?1602583602=&response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DFerrari_S_Iaffaldano_N_and_Santamato_V_R.pdf&Expires=1619884310&Signature=PnJylhYa07v3YzWFQ7g5IGPNDknRr9wHYR-1fMnOg7w2Ojc562uRxkjXKpYug8DJQhsA3gYGioTRxunLLmTDnahZs-yCMJu1eYz6xmmpal14VJq6VLPqoRhy6ZP6P7KKR~ai0jGW-hV74P7SUDCTuaieNAI6bjw55fQqWVCf5UjAhFVy0xBQiS2kNV1edy9Yn5jD9mmXQPiq5xqHNXaQgXClgJXgWsA79N1IuJuiqERi9CrzsXTYhnNMXGeGHBRASSbW1RvuBXb9Cud-Mt79j~gUrdYMKZX6VBR~xp5bBDDt2AVGpodYOqzzjZBfftnWDqUUlsDEu7v5Iyo4xhRSoQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA#page=43|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210501150223/https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/64667189/ITEMA_2019-DRAFT-Conference-Proceedings.pdf?1602583602=&response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DFerrari_S_Iaffaldano_N_and_Santamato_V_R.pdf&Expires=1619884310&Signature=PnJylhYa07v3YzWFQ7g5IGPNDknRr9wHYR-1fMnOg7w2Ojc562uRxkjXKpYug8DJQhsA3gYGioTRxunLLmTDnahZs-yCMJu1eYz6xmmpal14VJq6VLPqoRhy6ZP6P7KKR~ai0jGW-hV74P7SUDCTuaieNAI6bjw55fQqWVCf5UjAhFVy0xBQiS2kNV1edy9Yn5jD9mmXQPiq5xqHNXaQgXClgJXgWsA79N1IuJuiqERi9CrzsXTYhnNMXGeGHBRASSbW1RvuBXb9Cud-Mt79j~gUrdYMKZX6VBR~xp5bBDDt2AVGpodYOqzzjZBfftnWDqUUlsDEu7v5Iyo4xhRSoQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA#page=43|url-status=dead|archive-date=2021-05-01|first1=Adina|last1=Săcara-Onița|first2=Andra-Teodora|last2=Porumb|first3=Ciprian Beniamin|last3=Benea| title=3rd International Scientific Conference ITEMA Recent Advances in Information Technology Tourism Economics Management and Agriculture | chapter=The Evolution of the Romanian Pastry.

=== Greece ===
In [[Greek cuisine]], [[walnut]]s are more common than pistachios, and the dessert is flavored with [[cinnamon]]. Greek baklava ({{Langx|el|Μπακλαβάς}}) comes in many regional guises, with different names such as samousades, zournadakia, and masourakia. Generally speaking, in [[southern Greece]] baklava is mostly made with chopped almonds and in the [[Northern Greece|north]] with walnuts. Some recipes use hazelnuts, sesame or raisins.<ref>{{Cite book |title=More Than Baklava |isbn=9780960666812|last1= Semos|first1= Evelyn|date= 1982|publisher= Neiman Marcus}}</ref> The syrup is made of sugar, honey, water, cinnamon and orange or lemon [[Zest (ingredient)|zest]] and juice.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Alexiadou |first=Vefa |title=Greece: The Cookbook |date=20 March 2017 |publisher=Phaidon Press |isbn=978-0714873800}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Traditional Greek Baklava Recipe |date=15 May 2021 |url=https://thegreekdeli.com/traditional-greek-baklava-recipe/ }}</ref> Greek baklava is supposed to be made with 33 [[Filo|filo dough]] layers, referring to the years of [[Jesus]]'s life.<ref name="Theodore Kyriakou and Charles Campion 2004"/>

On the island of [[Lesbos]] in Greece a type of baklava is still known as [[Placenta cake|placenta]] ({{langx|el|πλατσέντα}}), which is the name of an Ancient Greek pastry that is often seen as the predecessor of baklava. The latter is a baked dessert with very thinly made pastry layers and chopped nuts. The base for this modern {{lang|la|placenta}} is made with leaves of [[Filo|filo dough]], and nuts stacked upon each other. After baking, it is soaked in [[simple syrup]] and sprinkled with cinnamon.<ref>{{cite web |author=Αποστολή με |title=Πλατσέντα, από την Αγία Παρασκευή Λέσβου &#124; Άρθρα &#124; Bostanistas.gr : Ιστορίες για να τρεφόμαστε διαφορετικά |url=http://www.bostanistas.gr/?i=bostanistas.el.article&id=3528 |access-date=2017-01-28 |website=Bostanistas.gr}}</ref><ref name="cookbook">{{cite book |last=Λούβαρη-Γιαννέτσου |first=Βασιλεία |title=Τα Σαρακοστιανά 50 συνταγές για τη Σαρακοστή και τις γιορτές |year=2014 |trans-title=Lent foods: 50 recipes for Lent and the holidays |chapter=Πλατσέντα ή γλυκόπιτα |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5U0iAwAAQBAJ&q=%CF%80%CE%BB%CE%B1%CF%84%CF%83%CE%AD%CE%BD%CF%84%CE%B1&pg=PT161}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Cuisine of Lesvos |work=VisitGreece |url=https://www.visitgreece.gr/experiences/gastronomy/traditional-cuisine/cuisine-of-lesvos/}}</ref>

===Turkey===
In [[Turkish cuisine]], baklava is traditionally filled with pistachios, walnuts or almonds (in some parts of the [[Aegean Region]]). In the [[Black Sea Region]] hazelnuts are commonly used as a filling for baklava.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wittistanbul.com/magazine/what-is-baklava-and-where-to-find-the-best-baklava-in-istanbul |title=What is baklava—and where to find the best baklava in Istanbul? |work=Witt magazine |access-date=2013-10-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004231854/http://www.wittistanbul.com/magazine/what-is-baklava-and-where-to-find-the-best-baklava-in-istanbul/ |archive-date=2013-10-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Hazelnut]]s are also used as a filling for the [[List of Turkish desserts|Turkish dessert]] ''[[Sütlü Nuriye]]'', a lighter version of the dessert which substitutes [[milk]] for the [[simple syrup]] used in traditional baklava recipes.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Ihtilal Tatlısı Sütlü Nuriye'nin Trajikomik Hikayesi| work = Milliyet Haber| date = 30 June 2014| access-date = 2018-11-09| url = http://www.milliyet.com.tr/ihtilal-tatlisi-sutlu-nuriye-nin-trajikomik-istanbul-yerelhaber-270887/| archive-date = 2016-11-26| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161126195306/http://www.milliyet.com.tr/ihtilal-tatlisi-sutlu-nuriye-nin-trajikomik-istanbul-yerelhaber-270887/| url-status = live}}</ref> ''Midye Baklava'' is a mussel-shaped baklava filled with nuts.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ajith |first1=Adithi Reena |title=Turkish delights: Kebabs, kunefe & more at Delhi’s Ophelia |url=https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/delhi/2025/Mar/20/turkish-delights-kebabs-kunefe-more-at-delhis-ophelia |work=The New Indian Express |date=20 March 2025 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Midye baklavayı ben buldum diyen baklavacının tescili iptal edildi |url=https://www.hurriyet.com.tr/ekonomi/midye-baklavayi-ben-buldum-diyen-baklavacinin-tescili-iptal-edildi-40962110 |access-date=9 November 2025 |work=Hurriyet |date=20 September 2018 |language=tr |trans-title=The registration of the baklava shop that claimed to have invented mussel baklava was cancelled.}}</ref> ''Pistachio [[Sarma (food)|sarma]]'' baklava is a green rolled baklava with ground pistachio butter filling.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fıstıklı sarma {{!}} Traditional Sweet Pastry From Turkiye |url=https://www.tasteatlas.com/fistikli-sarma |website=Taste Atlas |access-date=27 November 2025}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Fıstıklı sarma fiyatı yeni gelen zamla birlikte bin lirayı aştı |url=https://www.halkinsesi.com.tr/fistikli-sarma-fiyati-yeni-gelen-zamla-birlikte-bin-lirayi-asti |access-date=27 November 2025 |work=HALKIN SESİ |language=tr |trans-title=The price of pistachio wraps has exceeded 1,000 lira with the new price increase.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Merkezi |first1=Haber |title=Türk tatlıları dünya listesine damga vurdu: 2024'ün en iyi 100 tatlısı arasında Türkiye’nin başarısı! |url=https://www.politikam.com/turk-tatlilari-dunya-listesine-damga-vurdu-2024un-en-iyi-100-tatlisi-arasinda-turkiyenin-basarisi |access-date=27 November 2025 |work=Politika |date=20 November 2024 |language=tr |trans-title=Turkish desserts made their mark on the world list: Türkiye's success among the top 100 desserts of 2024!}}</ref>
