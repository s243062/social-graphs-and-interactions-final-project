'''''Pad kaphrao''''' ({{langx|th|ผัดกะเพรา}}, {{IPA|th|pʰàt kà.pʰrāw|pron}}; {{translation|stir-fried [[Ocimum tenuiflorum|holy basil]]}}), also spelled ''pad kaprow'', ''pad kaprao'', or ''pad gaprao'', is one of the most popular Thai dishes in [[Thailand]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Thuan|first1=Willy|title=Thuan, W. (n.d.). Top 10 Thai Food - Most Popular Thai Foods|url=http://www.bangkok.com/food-top10.htm}}</ref>

==History==
''Phat kaphrao'' originated around the reign of [[Prajadhipok|King Rama VII]] (r. 1925–1935 CE), as [[Thai Chinese|Chinese immigrants in Thailand]] began selling it at restaurants. Before the invention of ''phat kaphrao'', the most similar dish was ''phat bai horapha'' (stir-fried beef and [[Thai basil]]).<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |date=2024-05-13 |title=รู้ที่มา "ผัดกะเพรา" เมนูสุดฮิต ซอฟต์พาวเวอร์อาหารไทยที่ทั่วโลกยกนิ้วให้ |url=https://www.khaosod.co.th/sentangsedtee/featured/article_277798 |access-date=2025-07-24 |language=th}}</ref> These dishes were likely adaptations of the [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] dish ''xiāngcài chǎo niúròu'' ({{zh|t=香菜炒牛肉|p=|s=|l=stir-fried beef and coriander}}).<ref name=":1" /> 

''Phat kraphao'' is considered a [[national dish]] in Thailand today but it only became popular in the country after 1957.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |date=2019-06-15 |title=คอลัมน์ออนไลน์ - กะเพราแมวอ้วน ผัดกะเพราด้วยการตลาดยุคใหม่ |url=https://www.naewna.com/columnonline/40385 |access-date=2025-07-24 |website=naewna |language=th}}</ref> ''Phat kaphrao'' was included in cookbooks in the late 1970s but the method of preparation was different. It involved marinating minced meat with liquor first, then seasoning the dish with only fish sauce and palm sugar.<ref name=":0" /> 

== Ingredients ==
[[File:Kraphao mu khai dao.jpg|thumb|250px|''Phat kaphrao mu sap'' with rice and a fried egg]]
''Phat kaphrao'' consists of meat such as pork, chicken, beef, or seafood stir fried with [[Ocimum tenuiflorum|holy basil]] and garlic. It is served with rice and optionally topped with fried eggs. The main seasonings are soy sauce, [[Fish sauce|Thai fish sauce]], [[oyster sauce]] (optional), cane sugar, and [[bird's eye chili]]. 

Over time, ''phat kaphrao'' has evolved with the addition of other ingredients such as [[Century egg|Chinese century eggs]] and Thai local vegetables, namely [[asparagus bean]]s, [[baby corn]]s, onions, carrots, [[banana peppers]], mushrooms, [[bamboo shoots]] and coconut shoots. However, adding vegetables in ''phat kaphrao'' is also seen as an effort to reduce the cost of meat and increase profit margins on the part of food vendors.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/magazine/a-garlicky-stir-fry-with-basil-leaves-from-bangkok.html|title=A Garlicky Stir-Fry With Basil Leaves From Bangkok|work=The New York Times |date=25 January 2018 |last1=Rao |first1=Tejal }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://pantip.com/topic/33443116|title=Why Phat Kaphrao needs cowpea|date=30 March 2016}}</ref>
