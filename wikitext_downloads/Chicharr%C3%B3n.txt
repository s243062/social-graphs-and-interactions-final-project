'''{{lang|es|Chicharrón}}'''<ref>({{IPA|es|tʃitʃaˈron|lang}}, plural {{lang|es|chicharrones}}; {{langx|pt|torresmo}} {{IPA|pt|tuˈʁeʒmu, toˈʁezmu, toˈʁeʒmu|}}; {{langx|tl|chicharon}}; {{langx|gn|chicharõ}}; {{langx|ch|chachalon}})</ref> is a dish generally consisting of fried [[pork belly]] or fried [[pork rind]]s. {{lang|es|Chicharrón}} may also be made from chicken, mutton, or beef.

==Name==
{{lang|es|Chicharrón}}, as a dish with sauces, or {{lang|es|chicharrones}} as finger-food snacks, are popular in [[Andalusia]] and [[Canary Islands|Canarias]] in Spain, [[Latin America]] and other places with Spanish influence, including the [[Southwestern United States]]. In Spain it is called [[Torreznos|torrezno]] outside of Andalusia. It is part of the traditional cuisines of [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Portugal]] (where it is called {{lang|pt-BR|torresmo}}), [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Cuba]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guam]], [[Guatemala]], [[Haiti]], [[Honduras]], [[El Salvador]], [[Mexico]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Panama]], [[Peru]], the [[Philippines]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Venezuela]], [[Belize]], and others. The singular form of the term or a variant of it is also used as a [[mass noun]] in [[Filipino language|Filipino]] and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], languages in which stand-alone plurals do not exist.

{{lang|es|Chicharrones}} are usually made from various cuts of [[pork]] but sometimes with [[mutton]], [[Chicken as food|chicken]], or other meats. In some places, they are made from pork ribs with skin attached and other meatier cuts, rather than just rinds.

==National variants==
The [[pork rind]] variant is the skin of the pork after it has been seasoned and [[deep-fried]] often to a crispy, puffy state. Other styles may be fatty or meaty, not fried as much, and sometimes attached to ribs or other bones. In Mexico, they are eaten in a [[taco]] or {{lang|es|[[gordita]]}} with {{lang|es|[[salsa verde]]}}. Serving styles vary widely, including main course, side dish, filling for tortillas and other bread, the meat portion of stews, and as finger-food snacks.

===Belize===
In [[Belize]], {{lang|es|chicharrón}} made from pork belly can be served with {{lang|es|[[escabeche]]}} (onion soup). There are other variations of {{lang|es|chicharrón}} in Belize made from beef skin.

===Bolivia===
{{lang|es|Chicharrón}} is made of pork ribs seasoned with garlic, oregano and lemon. It is boiled and then cooked in its own fat, adding beer or {{lang|es|[[chicha]]}} to the pot for more flavor. Pork chicharrón is normally served only on Sundays and is eaten with {{lang|es-BO|[[llajwa]]}}, a tomato salsa, and {{lang|es|[[Mote (food)|mote]]}}, a type of corn ([[maize]]). There are other variations of chicharrón made with chicken and fish.

===Brazil===
In Brazil, it is known as {{lang|es|torresmo}}. The dish may be seasoned with garlic, pepper, and/or other spices. It is cooked in its own fat or oil; the finished product is typically complemented with a wedge of lime.

===Canada===
{{lang|fr|[[Oreilles de crisse]]}} is a traditional [[Quebec]] dish consisting of deep-fried [[Salting (food)|salted]] [[fatback]]. It is generally served in ''cabanes à sucre'' (sugar shacks) in spring time, as a "palate cleanser" between maple syrup-laden foods.

===Chile===
{{lang|es|Chicharrones}} are made of fat, sometimes with a bit of meat, and are typically served with homemade bread.

===Colombia===
{{lang|es|Chicharrón}} is made from deep-fried pig skin with meat attached, but it can also be made from chicken skin. In the [[Caribbean Region of Colombia|Caribbean coast]], it is eaten along with {{lang|es|bollo de [[Cassava|yuca]]}}, {{lang|es|bollo limpio}} or boiled yuca at breakfast at home or at any time of the day at restaurants. It is eaten chopped as a stuffing in {{lang|es|[[arepa]]s}}. In [[Córdoba Department|Córdoba]], it is also prepared in {{lang|es|[[sancocho]]}}. It is also part of {{lang|es|[[bandeja paisa]]}}, a typical dish of Antioquia.

===Costa Rica===
{{lang|es|Chicharrones}} are made by frying pork (usually ribs) in fat, and are associated with several dishes. Most Costa Ricans eat them with {{lang|es|[[Rangpur (fruit)|rangpur]]}} or [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] juice and fried yuca, accompanied by tortillas. They are also a main ingredient in a popular dish called {{lang|es|chifrijo}}, which also combines red beans, rice, and {{lang|es|[[pico de gallo]]}}.

===Trinidad and Tobago===
{{lang|es|Chicharrón}} is usually eaten with [[tostones]]. It is prepared by washing and drying pork and cutting it into small pieces, which are seasoned with a mix of lemon juice and salt.

===El Salvador===
{{lang|es|[[Pupusa]]s}} are often filled with chopped {{lang|es|chicharrón}} as a stuffing.

===Guam===
The dish is known in the local [[Chamorro language]] as {{lang|ch|chachalon}}, derived from the food's Spanish name.

===Guatemala===
{{lang|es|Chicharrón}} is eaten with tortillas, lime, guacamole, and ''[[moronga]]'' sausage, and sometimes served with ''[[pico de gallo]]'' or ''Chirmol salsa''. Also known as ''{{lang|es|carnitas}}'' in Guatemala, these refer to a meatier part of the pork rind. Where a {{lang|es|chicharrón}} is, strictly speaking, skin and fat, ''{{lang|es|carnitas}}'' denotes skin with some meat as well. (In other places, ''carnitas'' generally refers to fried pork meat without skin or a stew-like dish made from it.)

===Mexico===
Besides {{lang|es|chicharrón}} made from pig skin and fat, snack-food companies [[Barcel]] and [[Sabritas]] have commercialized vegetarian versions (primarily made of puffed [[cornmeal]] batter) with [[Chile pepper|chile]] and [[Lemon (fruit)|lemon]] flavorings since the 1980s. {{lang|es|Chicharrón de cerdo}} are also distributed by many salty snack companies in Mexico, sold in supermarkets, and made and sold by markets, {{lang|es|[[tianguis]]}}, and street vendors. {{lang|es|Tacos de chicharrón}} ({{lang|es|chicharrones}} wrapped in a tortilla with some [[avocado]], creamy cheese (such as {{lang|es|[[queso panela]]}}, {{lang|es|[[queso blanco]]}}, or {{lang|es|queso fresco}}), and sometimes, hot sauce) are popular as snacks, appetizers, or a main dish. Popular dishes that make use of {{lang|es|chicharrón}} as a main ingredient include {{lang|es|chicharrón con [[Salsa verde#Mexican salsa verde|salsa verde]]}} and {{lang|es|[[gordita]]s de chicharrón}}. The North Mexico version is made with fried pork belly (and has more meat, compared to the South Mexico version), and is more based on Spanish {{lang|es|torreznos}}.

===Peru===
[[File:ChicharronMote.JPG|thumb|right|{{lang|es|Chicharrón}} from the [[Ancash Region]] of [[Peru]]]]
[[File:ChicharronMixto.JPG|thumb|Mixed seafood Chicharrón, as served in Peru]]

{{lang|es|Chicharrón}} in Peru is made using what is called "country-style pork rib" in the United States. The rind (skin and attached fat) is not used at all; instead, the meat is boiled with seasonings and spices until no water remains and then fried in its own fat. It is often served as a breakfast or brunch food on a baguette with a relish made from red onion and lime juice. {{lang|es|Chicharrón}} can be eaten as an [[appetizer]] or snack, and the chicken variant can taste like fried chicken found in the United States. Side dishes include a kind of [[red onion]] [[relish]], fried [[cassava|yuca]], and other regional variants. {{lang|es|Chicharrón}} can also be prepared with fish rather than pork.

===Philippines===

[[File:Vegan chicharon from the Philippines 01.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Vegan]] {{lang|fil|chicharon}} from the Philippines, made with mushroom, potato, carrot, and [[tapioca]] starch]]

{{lang|fil|Chicharon}}, less commonly spelled {{lang|fil|tsitsaron}} or {{lang|fil|sitsaron}}, is ubiquitous, as it is a well-loved snack, and may be bought anywhere, from large supermarket chains to small neighborhood [[Sari-sari store|{{lang|fil|sari-sari|nocat=y}} store]]s and street vendors. It is popular as {{lang|fil|[[Filipino cuisine#Pulutan accompaniments snack for drinks|pulutan]]}} or [[tapas]] which are foods to be eaten while consuming alcoholic beverages such as [[beer]]. It is also used as a topping on many native vegetable and noodle dishes. Pork {{lang|fil|chicharon}} is prepared by deep-frying dried pork rind with a little salt. It may be dipped in coconut vinegar spiced with [[soy sauce]], chopped garlic and {{lang|fil|[[labuyo]]}} chili peppers, or eaten with other condiments like {{lang|fil|[[bagoong]]}} anchovies, {{lang|fil|[[lechon]]}} [[gravy|gravy sauce]], or {{lang|fil|[[atchara]]}} papaya salad.

Aside from pork rind, chicken skin may also be made into {{lang|fil|chicharong manok}}, whereas {{lang|fil|chicharong bulaklak}}—literally 'flower chicharrón', named for its distinctive shape—is made from pork mesentery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://reelandgrill.blogspot.com/2011/02/tsitsaron-or-chicharon-bulaklak-deep.html |title=Reel and Grill: Tsitsaron or Chicharon Bulaklak (Deep Fried Pork Mesentery) |last=Cuisinegineer|date=3 February 2011 |work=Reel and Grill |via=Blogspot}}</ref>

Tuna-skin {{lang|fil|chicharon}} is marketed as a healthier variation. In [[Cagayan]], [[carabao|water buffalo]] hide is used to make {{lang|fil|carabao chicharon}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.abs-cbn.com/life/03/19/17/5-reasons-to-visit-cagayan-this-summer |title=5 reasons to visit Cagayan this summer |first=Kara |last=Santos |date=19 March 2017 |publisher=ABS-CBN News}}</ref>

A distinct variant of {{lang|fil|chicharon}} involves cooking pork loin and meat in the same way, becoming {{lang|fil|[[bagnet]]}}. While similar and dissimilar to [[Crispy pata|crispy {{lang|fil|pata|nocat=y}}]], it is more popular as a meal than finger food, and has found its way to contemporary dishes and restaurants. Bagnet originates from Ilocos where it has been served since the 1960s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yummy.ph/lessons/cooking/pork-bagnet-ilocos-dish|title=Did You Know That Bagnet is Called 'Chicharon' in Ilocos?|website=yummy.ph}}</ref>

Fully [[vegan]] versions of {{lang|fil|chicharon}} are also made in the Philippines using deep-fried [[tofu skin]], mushrooms, [[edible seaweed|seaweed]], starch, and other plant-based ingredients.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Arnaldo |first1=Steph |title=This Manila shop makes plant-based 'chicharon' |url=https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/food-drinks/shirley-just-vegan-shop-plant-based-chicharon-manila/ |access-date=26 August 2024 |work=Rappler |date=5 February 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Vegan Filipino Chicharon, Two Ways |url=https://www.astigvegan.com/mushroom-chicharon/ |website=Astig Vegan |date=23 April 2017 |access-date=26 August 2024}}</ref> Commercial [[Chip (snack)|chips]] like ''Chicharron ni Mang Juan'' and ''Marty's Cracklin''' are also [[vegan]], with the exception of a few flavors.<ref>{{cite news |title=Philippines: Accidentally Vegan Supermarket Food List |url=https://www.petaasia.com/living/food/accidentally-vegan-philippines/ |access-date=26 August 2024 |publisher=PETA Asia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Fruno |first1=Ashley |title=Vegetarian Food Find: Marty's Vegetarian Chicharon |url=https://www.petaasia.com/news/vegetarian-food-find-martys-vegetarian-chicharon/ |access-date=26 August 2024 |publisher=PETA Asia |date=13 September 2010}}</ref>

===Puerto Rico===
{{lang|es|[[Mofongo]]}} is a popular dish in which green [[Cooking banana|plantain]]s, [[cassava]], or [[breadfruit]] are fried then mashed with {{lang|es|chicharrón}} and other ingredients. {{lang|es|Chuleta}} {{lang|tnq|kan-kan}} is found in Puerto Rican {{lang|es|[[wikt:fonda#Spanish|fonda]]s}}, using a [[pork chop]] ({{lang|es|chuleta}}) with rib, fat, and skin still attached, then [[Marinade|marinated]]. {{lang|es|Chuleta}} {{lang|tnq|kan-kan}} is deep-fried, forming {{lang|es|chicharrónes}} of crispy skin attached to the rib and pork-chop meat. The city of [[Bayamón, Puerto Rico|Bayamón]] – nicknamed the "city of {{lang|es|chicharrón}}" – is famous for the {{lang|es|chicharrón}} produced locally, as is the Guavate barrio in the city of [[Cayey, Puerto Rico|Cayey]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.buenapetitopr.com/index.php |title = Buenapetito! - Base de recetas y restaurantes de Puerto Rico | website = Buenapetitopr.com}}</ref> {{lang|es|Chicharrón}} is a popular ingredient in Puerto Rican [[rice]] with added [[sofrito]], [[pigeon pea]]s, spices and other ingredients. ''Rusiao de yuca'' like pasteles are made from grated cassava that has been dehydrated, toasted, then notably rehydrated with coconut milk into [[masa]] and seasoned with anise, mashed or finely chopped ''chicharrón'', [[oregano]] among other ingredients. They are then wrapped in banana leaf and grilled.

=== Serbia ===
In Serbia they are called {{lang|sr|čvarci}}. Usually made during the slaughter of pigs for the winter. Usually cooked with milk and lard to give them a nice gold color after they have been pressed through a pressure sift to make them have the texture of chips.

===United States===
[[United States|US]]-style [[pork rinds]] are usually made from pig skin and fat without meat. They are commonly seasoned and sold in plastic bags, like corn and [[potato chips]] as a "[[junk food]]" item. Some brands in the [[American Southwest|Southwest]] use the Spanish term {{lang|es|chicharrones}}, and Mexican-style {{lang|es|chicharrón}} dishes are available in many Mexican and Southwestern restaurants in the region. In the [[Deep South]], traditional home-cooked pork rinds are called ''[[cracklings]]'' or (colloquially) ''cracklins''. They are made in a two-step process: the pork skin is first rendered and dried, and then fried and puffed.<ref name="zeldes">{{cite web |last=Zeldes |first=Leah A. |title=Eat this! ''Chicharron'', mighty meaty crunch |work=Dining Chicago |publisher=Chicago's Restaurant & Entertainment Guide, Inc. |date=May 12, 2010 |url=http://www.diningchicago.com/blog/2010/05/12/eat-this-chicharron-mighty-meaty-crunch/ |access-date=May 22, 2010 |archive-date=December 3, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201203113558/http://www.diningchicago.com/blog/2010/05/12/eat-this-chicharron-mighty-meaty-crunch/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In [[New Mexico]], the term is often taken to mean just fried pork fat, sometimes with incidental bits of lean meat. Similar to the Mexican {{lang|es|chicharrón}}, its use in [[New Mexican cuisine]] is most commonly in bean burritos with chopped [[New Mexico chile]]. It is colloquially prepared by frying in a {{lang|es|disco}}, a [[wok]]-like pan made from a repurposed tractor disc blade.

===Uruguay===
{{lang|es|Chicharrones}} are a byproduct of [[tallow]] making in Uruguay. Usually extracted from the softest fat of the cow located on the kidneys, this fat is known as ''grasa de pella''. The ''pella'' is heated until melt and the solid residue are the ''chicharrones''. ''Chicharrones'' are traditionally used as additive for a typical bread called ''rosca de chicharrones''.

===Venezuela===
In central Venezuela, {{lang|es|chicharrones}} are eaten with {{lang|es|[[cachapa]]s}} and also commonly sold alongside main highways as snacks. The recipe usually produces crispy sizable portions of pork skin with the underlying meat. The {{lang|es|[[cuerito]]s}} type are also made with pork skin and marinated in vinegar instead of deep fried. They are eaten as a snack.

===Other countries===
[[Pork rind]] is also eaten in many other countries in forms unrelated to the {{lang|es|chicharrón}} tradition. For example, in [[Denmark]], {{lang|da|flæskesvær}} is pork skin deep-fried with or without a layer of fat. It is usually eaten as a snack, like crisps (chips) or popcorn. At Christmas-time it is also traditional to eat fried strips of pork belly the skin on, with or without meat in addition to fat.

In the countryside in Greece, during Christmas time people prepare "tsigarídes" which is deep fried pork belly skin.
In the United Kingdom, pork rinds are called "pork scratchings". They are a popular snack sold in pubs and bars, packaged in small plastic bags like potato crisps.
