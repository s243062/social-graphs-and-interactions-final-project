'''Fried chicken''', also called '''Southern fried chicken''', is a dish consisting of [[Chicken (food)|chicken]] pieces that have been coated with seasoned flour or [[batter (cooking)|batter]] and [[pan frying|pan-fried]], [[deep frying|deep-fried]], [[pressure frying|pressure-fried]], or [[Air fryer|air-fried]]. The [[breading]] adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken while retaining juices in the meat. [[Broiler]] chickens are most commonly used.

The first dish known to have been deep-fried was [[fritters]], which were popular in the European [[Middle Ages]]. However, the [[Scottish people|Scottish]] were the first to have been recorded as deep-frying their chicken in fat with breadcrumbs and seasonings, as evidenced by a recipe in a 1747 cookbook by [[Hannah Glasse]]<ref>{{Cite book |last=Glasse |first=Hannah |title=The Art of Cookery |publisher=Mrs Ashburn's China-Shop |year=1747 |location=London |pages=40 |quote=To marinate Chickens - Cut two Chickens into Quarters, lay them in Vinegar for three or four Hours with Pepper, Salt, a Bay-Leaf, and a few Cloves, make a very thick Batter, first with Half a Pint of Wine and Flour, then the Yolks of two Eggs, a little melted butter, some grated Nutmeg, and chopp'd Parsley; beat all very well together, dip your Fowls in the Batter, and fry them in a good deal of Hogs Lard, which must first boil before you put your Chickens in; let them be a fine Brown, and lay them in your Dish like a Pyramid, with fry'd Parsley all round them, Garnish with Lemon, and have some good Gravy in Boats or Basons. |url=https://archive.org/details/bim_eighteenth-century_the-art-of-cookery-made_glasse-hannah_1747}}</ref><ref name="BBC1" /> and a 1773 diary entry describing fried chicken on the Isle of Skye.<ref name="BBC1" /> The first known recipe in the US did not contain the seasonings that were in the earlier Scottish recipe.<ref name="BBC1" /> There is an English cookbook from 1736 which mentions fried chicken, the "Dictionarium Domesticum", by Nathan Bailey, where it is called "a marinade of chickens".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Dictionarium domesticum, being a new and compleat houshold [sic] dictionary, for the use both of city and country ... / By N.

When it was introduced to the American South, Southern fried chicken became a common staple.

American-style fried chicken gradually passed into everyday use as a general Southern dish, especially after the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]], and its popularity spread. Since fried chicken traveled well in hot weather before refrigeration was commonplace and industry growth reduced its cost, it gained further favor across the South. Fried chicken continues to be among this region's top choices for "Sunday dinner". Southern Jews blended Southern and Jewish [[foodways]] to make fried chicken a mainstay of Shabbat dinners alongside [[charoset]] and braided loaves of [[challah]].<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Lippy |editor1-first=Charles H. |editor2-last=Wilson |editor2-first=Charles Reagan |editor3-last=Hill |editor3-first=Samuel S. |title=Encyclopedia of Religion in the South |date=2005 |publisher=Mercer University Press |page=408}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Nadell |editor1-first=Pamela S. |title=American Jewish Women's History: A Reader |date=2003 |publisher=NYU Press |page=266}}</ref>

Brands such as [[KFC|Kentucky Fried Chicken]] (KFC) and [[Popeyes]] expanded in the United States and across the world.

Before the industrialization of chicken production and the creation of [[broiler]] breeds of chicken, only young spring chickens (pullets or cockerels) would be suitable for the higher heat and relatively fast cooking time of frying making fried chicken a luxury of spring and summer. Older, tougher birds require longer cooking times at lower temperatures. To compensate for this, sometimes tougher birds are simmered till tender, allowed to cool and dry, and then fried.<ref name="southernfriedchickenrecipe.com2">[http://www.southernfriedchickenrecipe.com/Fried-Chicken-Articles/history-of-fried-chicken.php History of Fried Chicken through the Ages] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112043731/http://www.southernfriedchickenrecipe.com/Fried-Chicken-Articles/history-of-fried-chicken.php|date=November 12, 2011}}.

To prepare the chicken pieces for frying, they are typically coated in a flour-based batter that may contain eggs or milk, or they may be dredged in flour or [[breadcrumbs]]. Seasonings such as salt, [[black pepper]], [[chili powder]], [[paprika]], [[garlic powder]], or [[onion powder]] can be mixed in with the flour. Either process may be preceded by [[marination]] or dipping in [[buttermilk]], the acidity of which acts as a meat tenderizer. As the pieces of chicken cook, some of the moisture that exudes from the chicken is absorbed by the coating of flour and browns along with the flour, creating a flavorful crust.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Science of Frying&nbsp;– FineCooking.com |url=http://www.finecooking.com/item/48328/the-science-of-frying |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613005316/http://www.finecooking.com/item/48328/the-science-of-frying |archive-date=June 13, 2016 |access-date=June 4, 2016 |website=FineCooking.com}}</ref>

Pan frying (or shallow frying) requires a [[frying pan]] of sturdy construction and a source of fat that does not fully immerse the chicken.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web |title=Pan Frying&nbsp;– Food Reference Cooking Basics&nbsp;– Food For Thought |url=http://www.foodreference.com/html/art-pan-frying.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609212453/http://www.foodreference.com/html/art-pan-frying.html |archive-date=June 9, 2016 |access-date=June 4, 2016 |website=www.foodreference.com}}</ref> The chicken pieces are prepared as above, then fried. Generally, the fat is heated to a temperature hot enough to seal (without browning, at this point) the outside of the chicken pieces. Once the pieces have been added to the hot fat and sealed, the temperature is reduced. There is debate as to how often to turn the chicken pieces, with one camp arguing for often turning and even browning, and the other camp pushing for letting the pieces render skin side down and only turning when necessary. Once the chicken pieces are close to being done, the temperature is raised and the pieces are browned to the desired color (some cooks add small amounts of butter at this point to enhance browning). The moisture from the chicken that sticks and browns on the bottom of the pan becomes the fonds required to make gravy.<ref>{{Cite web |date=September 14, 2012 |title=Deglazing: What it Is and Why Do It |url=http://www.reluctantgourmet.com/deglazing-what-it-is-and-why-do-it/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160525054041/http://www.reluctantgourmet.com/deglazing-what-it-is-and-why-do-it/ |archive-date=May 25, 2016 |access-date=June 4, 2016 |website=The Reluctant Gourmet |language=en-US}}</ref>

Deep frying requires a [[deep fryer]] or other devices in which the chicken pieces can be completely submerged in hot fat. The process of deep frying is placing food fully in oil and then cooking it at a very high temperature.<ref name="auto" /> The pieces are prepared as described above. The fat is heated in the deep fryer to the desired temperature. The pieces are added to the fat and a constant temperature is maintained throughout the cooking process.<ref>{{Cite web |title=How to deep-fry&nbsp;– How To Guides&nbsp;– Cooking tips |url=http://www.taste.com.au/how+to/articles/446/how+to+deep+fry |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617133530/http://www.taste.com.au/how+to/articles/446/how+to+deep+fry |archive-date=June 17, 2016 |access-date=June 4, 2016 |website=Taste.com.au}}</ref>

A [[pressure cooker]] can be used to accelerate the process.<ref>{{Cite web |title=How to make homemade Broasted Chicken |url=http://food.manoramaonline.com/food/dine-around/broasted-chicken-arab-dishes-kerala-non-veg-food-recipes.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725172718/http://food.manoramaonline.com/food/dine-around/broasted-chicken-arab-dishes-kerala-non-veg-food-recipes.html |archive-date=July 25, 2016 |access-date=July 21, 2016}}</ref> The moisture inside the chicken becomes steam and increases the pressure in the cooker, such that lowering the cooking temperature is needed. The steam also cooks the chicken through, but still allows the pieces to be moist and tender while maintaining a crisp coating. Fat is heated in a pressure cooker. Chicken pieces are prepared as described above and then placed in the hot fat. The lid is placed on the pressure cooker, and the chicken pieces are thus fried under pressure.<ref name="southernfood.about.com2">[http://southernfood.about.com/od/friedchicken/Fried_Chicken_Recipes.htm Fried Chicken Recipes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023185815/http://southernfood.about.com/od/friedchicken/Fried_Chicken_Recipes.htm |date=October 23, 2011 }}.
