When it comes to the history of [[Wenchang chicken]], according to the records of Lin Zhemin from the Livestock and Veterinary Research Institute of [[Hainan Province]], it has long been a delicacy used by local officials and people to entertain guests. According to the Hainan Chamber of Commerce, it is said that during the [[Ming Dynasty]], a Wenchang native served in the imperial court and brought Wenchang chicken back to his hometown to entertain members of the [[royal family]] during the [[Lunar New Year]]. As they tasted it, the royals praised, "This chicken hails from the land of culture, where talents gather and the culture flourishes. The chicken is also delicious and fragrant, truly deserving the name Wenchang chicken!"

Additionally, during the reign of the [[Guangxu Emperor]] of the [[Qing Dynasty]], there were several large [[banyan]] trees in Wenchang, which bore seeds all year round. The chickens pecked at these seeds and became plump and delicious, contributing to the reputation of Wenchang chicken's deliciousness. The earliest mention can be found in the Qing Dynasty book "Lingnan Miscellaneous Poems," which states, "There is a kind of hen in Wenchang County that tastes as good as a rooster."

Based on historical records and inference, Wenchang chicken was introduced to Hainan Island, specifically Wenchang County, around the early 1600s during the Ming Dynasty, along with mainland immigrants, and was cultivated in this unique natural environment. By the Ming and Qing dynasties, there was already a tradition of raising Wenchang chickens in rural areas of Wenchang. It was mainly used as a delicacy for festivals, entertaining guests, and giving gifts. After the revolution in China in 1949, it was still difficult to buy or eat Wenchang chicken in the market or restaurants.

According to a 2006 study in "Meat Research," Wenchang chicken is a high-quality chicken breed in Hainan with a history of over 400 years and is one of the four famous dishes of Hainan. In the 1980s, due to the impact of foreign chicken breeds, Wenchang chicken was once on the brink of extinction.<ref>{{cite web |date=2000-01-01 |title=经典 "正宗"与"正名"|url=https://www.foodcritic.my/index.php/2021/06/28/falyuzhuisuhainanjifanzhengzongyuzhengming/ |access-date=2024-03-03 |publisher=foodcritic}}</ref>[[File:Hainanese chicken rice at Thai Ten.jpg|thumb|With [[Daikon|radish]] soup]]

===Singapore===
[[Image:Chatterbox ChickenRice.JPG|thumb|Hainanese chicken rice at [[Chatterbox (restaurant)|Chatterbox]], [[Meritus Mandarin Singapore]]]]

In Singapore, the dish was born out of frugality, created by servant-class immigrants trying to utilise limited sources to its maximum. An old hen which had passed its eggs laying years would be slaughtered to be cooked into broth and rice to extract the chicken flavour.<ref name="farleyBBC6nov2015" />

The first chicken rice restaurants opened in Singapore during [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|Japanese occupation]] in World War II, when the British were forced out and their Hainanese servants lost their source of income.

The chicken is dipped in ice after cooking to produce a jelly-like skin finishing and hung to dry.<ref name="farleyBBC6nov2015" />

The stock is skimmed of fat and some of the fat and liquid, along with [[ginger]], garlic, and [[pandan leaves]], are used in the cooking of the rice, producing an oily, flavourful rice sometimes known as "oily rice".<ref name="farleyBBC6nov2015" /> In Singapore "the most important part of chicken rice is not the chicken, but the rice."<ref name="farleyBBC6nov2015" />

The dish is served with a dipping sauce of freshly minced red chilli and garlic, usually accompanied with [[dark soy sauce]] and freshly ground ginger. Fresh cucumber boiled in the chicken broth and light soy sauce with a dash of sesame oil is served with the chicken, which is usually served at room temperature.<ref name="kauffmanSFC3feb2016">{{cite news |last1=Kauffman |first1=Jonathan |title=Hainanese chicken rice: Southeast Asia's ever-evolving comfort food |url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/restaurants/article/Hainanese-chicken-rice-Southeast-Asia-s-6805068.php |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=3 February 2016 |access-date=13 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190114044539/https://www.sfchronicle.com/restaurants/article/Hainanese-chicken-rice-Southeast-Asia-s-6805068.php |archive-date=14 January 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="farleyBBC6nov2015" /> Some stalls may also serve [[Peranakan cuisine#List of Nonya dishes|nonya achar]] as an additional side.<ref name="tanCHANNEL11nov2017" />

[[File:2013 Khao man kai CM.jpg|thumb|''Khao man kai'', a Thai variation on Hainanese chicken rice]]
Hainanese chicken rice is a common [[Thai cuisine|dish in Thailand]] where it is called ''khao man kai'' ({{langx|th|ข้าวมันไก่}}, {{IPA|th|kʰâːw mān kàj|pron}}), literally meaning "chicken oily rice". The chickens used in Thailand for this dish are usually free range chickens of local breeds, resulting in a leaner and tastier texture; however, meat from chickens of [[Poultry farming#Intensive chicken farming|large scale poultry farms]] is increasingly being used.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://review.thaiware.com/1726.html|title=ข้าวมันไก่ แต่ละแบบ แตกต่างกันอย่างไร|trans-title=What's the difference between each chicken rice|language=thai|work=THAIWARE|author=moonlightkz|date=2019-12-20|accessdate=2022-04-08}}</ref> ''Khao man kai'' is served with a garnish of cucumbers and occasionally chicken [[blood tofu]] and fresh [[coriander]], along with a bowl of ''nam sup'', a clear chicken broth which often contains sliced [[daikon]].
