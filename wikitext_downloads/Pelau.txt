'''Pelau''' is a traditional rice dish from the West Indies ([[Guadeloupe]], [[Dominica]]) and Caribbean countries such as [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Grenada]], [[Saint Lucia]] and the [[Virgin Islands]]. Its main ingredients typically include meat (usually chicken or beef),<ref>{{cite book |last=Ganeshram |first=Ramin |date=2012 |title=Sweet Hands.

Various vegetables and spices may be added. Common spices used in the dish are cardamom, cloves, cumin, and coriander.<ref name="Dainty Dishes for Indian Tables 1881">{{cite book | title=Dainty Dishes for Indian Tables ... | publisher=W.

An alternative preparation method is to sauté the meat, precook the rice, prepare the dish and bake it in the oven.<ref>{{cite book |date=2002 |title=The Multi-Cultural Cuisine of Trinidad & Tobago.

Pelau shares its origins with [[pilaf]] (from Persian ''pilāw'' {{lang|fa|پلاو}}), a rice dish from [[Central Asia]], the [[Middle East]], [[East Africa]], [[South Asia]], and Spain, home of the original version of [[paella]]. Pelau is a Creole dish. When the island was under Spanish colonial rule, Indian indentured servants passed down their version of the dish to African slaves who transformed it.<ref>https://www.guardian.co.tt/life/pelau-the-unofficial-national-dish-of-trinidad--tobago-6.2.653616.86e855f11f</ref> The caramelisation of the meat goes back to African preparation traditions.<ref>{{cite book |last=DeWitt |first=Dave and Wilan, Mary Jane |date=1993 |title=Callaloo, Calypso & Carnival. The Cuisines of Trinidad & Tobago |url=https://archive.org/details/callaloocalypsoc00dewi/page/60 |location=Freedom |publisher=Crossing Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/callaloocalypsoc00dewi/page/60 60] |isbn=0895946394 |url-access=registration }}</ref> Over time, the basic method of preparing pilaf, the caramelisation of meat and influences of the Trinidadian cuisine (especially with regards to available ingredients) mingled into today's pelau.
