== Ingredients and serving ==
The dish is made from [[tomato]]es, [[cucumber]]s, [[onion]]/[[scallion]]s, raw or roasted [[Capsicum|pepper]]s, and [[sirene]], a white brined cheese similar to feta, but much milder in taste.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=11enkZ2weg4C&dq=shopska+salad&pg=PA11 |title=Simple Treasures in Bulgaria, Martin Miller-Yianni, Martin Miller-Yianni, 2008, p. 11. |access-date=2023-03-16 |archive-date=2023-05-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230512060811/https://books.google.com/books?id=11enkZ2weg4C&dq=shopska+salad&pg=PA11 |url-status=live |last1=Miller-Yianni |first1=Martin |date=November 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://balkan-cuisine.com/2011/06/shopska-salad.html |title=Balkan Cuisine: Shopska Salad |access-date=November 21, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015124314/http://balkan-cuisine.com/2011/06/shopska-salad.html |archive-date=October 15, 2012 }}</ref> The vegetables are usually diced and salted, followed by a light dressing of [[sunflower oil]] (or [[olive oil]]),<ref>{{cite web|last1=Zhang|first1=Jenny|title=Shopska Salad: A Bulgarian Necessity|url=http://organicallyblissful.com/shopska-salad-bulgarian-necessity/|publisher=Organically Blissful|access-date=18 December 2016|archive-date=20 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220185918/http://organicallyblissful.com/shopska-salad-bulgarian-necessity/|url-status=live}}</ref> which is occasionally complemented by [[vinegar]]. The addition of vinegar contributes, however, to the sour flavour that the tomatoes impart. In restaurants, the dressings are provided separately. Finally, the vegetables are covered in a thick layer of grated or diced [[sirene]] cheese. This salad is often consumed as an appetizer with [[rakia]].

According to food anthropologist Rayna Gavrilova, the dish is commonly accompanied by a shot of [[Apricot brandy|apricot]] or other fruit brandy.<ref name=":3" />

== Background and history ==
Tomatoes appeared in Southeastern Europe in the mid-1800s.<ref name=":3" /> 

In the post-war socialist era, [[Balkantourist]] focused on marketing Bulgaria's [[Bulgarian Black Sea Coast|Black Sea coast]] as a tourist destination for Bulgarians and for western tourists as a way of showcasing the socialist "good life".<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Neuburger |first=Mary |date=2017-11-01 |title=Dining in Utopia: A Taste of the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast under Socialism |url=https://online.ucpress.edu/gastronomica/article/17/4/48/45179/Dining-in-Utopia-A-Taste-of-the-Bulgarian-Black |journal=[[Gastronomica]] |language=en |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=48–60 |doi=10.1525/gfc.2017.17.4.48 |issn=1529-3262|url-access=subscription }}</ref> This included reinventing and remarketing regional dishes to identify them as Bulgarian rather than simply Eastern European.<ref name=":0" /> The Shopska salad is a variation on a [[Greek salad]]<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|page=54|quote="This local take on a Greek salad"}} of cucumbers, tomatoes, and feta; Balkantourist in 1956 named their version Shopska salad.<ref name=":0" /><ref>Дечев, Стефан.

Despite the fact that the salad's name comes from the westernmost Bulgarian region called [[Shopi|Shopluk]], it first appeared at the Black Sea coast, in a resort near [[Varna, Bulgaria|Varna]], called [[Saints Constantine and Helena, Bulgaria|Druzhba]] in the restaurant "Chernomorets".<ref>Per Petar Doychev, at that time he and his colleagues were assembled in the restaurant "Chernomorets" by the leadership of the resort and it was said: "Think about something new, we can not offer only several salads to the guests."

The dish was initially served in Bulgaria only in the hotels of Balkantourist.<ref name=":1" /> It is the only survivor of five or six recipes similarly created for and marketed by the tourism industry.<ref name=":1">''That Salad was created by professional chefs from "Balkanturist" in 1956 at the restaurant "Chernomorets" in the then resort "Druzhba", now "Saint Konstantin and Elena" near Varna, Bulgaria. For the first time, the salad recipe appeared in 1956 in a "Book of the hostess" of P. Cholcheva and Al.Ruseva and it contained all the components of today Shopska except the cheese. In the following years, there were undergoing series of modifications to the recipe - in 1970 in the book "Recipe for cooking and confectionery" were given four options for Shopska salad - with onion and cheese; without onion and cheese; with roasted peppers and cheese; not sweet, but with chili pepper and cheese. In the early 1970s, roasted peppers and grated cheese were imposed as a mandatory component. Initially, the salad was served only in restaurants of "Balkanturist" and later it became popular in the home kitchens in the country. It became a national culinary symbol in Bulgaria during the 1970s and 1980s''.
