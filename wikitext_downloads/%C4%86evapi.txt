They are usually served in groups of five to ten pieces on a plate or in a [[pita|flatbread]] (''[[lepinja]]'' or ''[[somun]]''), often with chopped [[onion]]s, [[kajmak]], [[ajvar]] (optional), and [[Edible salt|salt]].

==Name and etymology==

The word ''ćevap'' is derived from the [[Ottoman Turkish]] ''[[kebab|kebap]]''. The word is sometimes used in conjunction with the common [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] [[diminutive]] ending ''-čići''/''-čiči''. {{langx|sq|qebapë}}; {{langx|bg|кебапчета|[[kebapche]]ta}}; {{langx|sh|ćevapi}} / {{lang|sh-Cyrl|ћевапи}}; {{langx|mk|ќебапчиња|ḱebapčinja}}; {{langx|sk|čevabčiči}}; {{langx|sl|čevapčiči}}. The word ''ćevapi'' is plural; the singular form ''ćevap'' is rarely used, as a typical serving consists of several ''ćevapi''.

==History==
[[File:Original Bosnian Cevapcici.JPG|thumb|Ćevapi in [[lepinja]], served with [[ajvar]]]]

During the Ottoman administration, ''[[hajduk]]s'' (rebels, outlaws) made the ''hajdučki ćevap'' ("hajduk ćevap"), which was easy to make, out of pieces of meat and smoked lard, on a skewer roasted over fire.<ref>{{cite book|title=Yugoslavia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jIUNAQAAIAAJ|year=1962|publisher=D.

[[File:Бањалучки ћевап.jpg|thumb|Banja Luka-style ćevapi]]
[[Banja Luka]]-style ćevapi (''Banjalučki ćevapi'') differ from all others because they are prepared as a meat tile typically consisting of four ćevapi connected in a row. They are usually made just with ground beef, salt, and pepper. According to the traditional recipe, [[garlic]] is added to "Banjalučki ćevap", the mixture must be aged for at least 36 hours at a very low temperature.<ref name="fsa.gov.ba"/>

==== Travnik-style ćevapi ====
[[File:Cevapi in Travnik.jpg|thumb|Travnik-style ćevapi]]
[[Travnik]]-style ćevapi (''Travnički ćevapi'') are made with a combination of beef, veal, and lamb, with the addition of salt, pepper, and a bit of baking soda. When grilled, the meat is often brushed with a clear broth that was prepared with beef bones and mutton. The bread, locally called pitica, is dipped in the broth, then grilled for a short time. Once grilled, the ćevapi are placed into the pitica, and they are then topped with chopped onions. It is recommended to serve this ćevapi variety with yogurt on the side.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Travnički ćevapi |url=https://www.tasteatlas.com/travnicki-cevapi |website=www.tasteatlas.com}}</ref>

==== Tuzla-style ćevapi ====
[[File:Tuzlanski ćevapi.jpg|thumb|Tuzla-style ćevapi]]
[[Tuzla]]-style ćevapi (''Tuzlanski ćevapi'') are usually made with a combination of ground mutton, beef, and lamb (usually in a ratio of 2:1:1), although some places prepare them only with beef. The meat is mixed by hand and seasoned with salt and pepper, and it is recommended to leave the meat combination in the refrigerator for a few hours or a whole day before the preparation. These ćevapi are cooked on an oiled grill, and once done, they are typically seasoned with pepper once more. Tuzlanski ćevapi are served in a round flatbread called lepinja, which has previously been dipped in a broth made from beef bones called poljev or poliv. Spring onions or raw chopped onions are traditional accompaniments to this meat dish.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tuzlanski ćevapi |url=https://www.tasteatlas.com/tuzlanski-cevapi |website=www.tasteatlas.com}}</ref>

==== Novi Pazar-style ćevapi ====
[[File:Cevapi Novi Pazar - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|Novi Pazar-style ćevapi]]
[[Novi Pazar]]-style ćevapi (''Pazarski ćevapi'') differ from Sarajevo-style ćevapi because they are generally made from beef – 70 percent, and should have 30 percent lamb, though it is optional if someone does not want it. They are best served only with onions, although they also contain a bit of onion inside of them. It is often served with hot red pepper. Pazarski ćevapi are slightly larger than other styles of ćevapi.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ti ćevapi... sarajevski, banjalučki, pazarski |url=https://www.rts.rs/lat/magazin/Zanimljivosti/5495524/cevapi.html |access-date=2025-03-08 |website=РТС |language=sr}}</ref>

==== Leskovac-style ćevapi ====
[[Leskovac]]-style ćevapi (''Leskovački ćevapi'') from Serbia differs from other styles of ćevapi in the sense that they contain [[pork]], which is eschewed in predominantly Muslim areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Leskovački ćevapi are made from minced meat, usually a mix of pork and beef, seasoned with salt, pepper, and sometimes garlic. The meat is hand-shaped into small cylindrical ćevaps, which are grilled over charcoal, giving them a distinctive smoky flavor and juiciness. They are slightly longer and thinner than other variations and are usually served in portions of five to ten pieces. They are traditionally served with fresh somun or lepinja, accompanied by chopped onions, hot peppers, ajvar, and sour cream.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ćevapi, koje su tajne omiljene roštiljske poslastice? |url=https://www.rts.rs/lat/magazin/Zanimljivosti/3171309/cevapi-koje-su-tajne-omiljene-rostiljske-poslastice.html |website=rts.rs |language=sr}}</ref>
