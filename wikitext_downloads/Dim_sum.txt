'''Dim sum''' ({{lang-zh|t={{linktext|點心}}|p=diǎn xīn|c=|s={{linktext|点心}}|first=t|j=dim2 sam1}}) is a large range of small Chinese dishes that are traditionally enjoyed in restaurants for [[brunch]].<ref name=":9">{{Cite book |last1=Davidson |first1=Alan  |last2=Jaine |first2=Tom |last3=Vannithone |first3=Soun |year=2014 |title=The Oxford companion to food |edition=3rd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RL6LAwAAQBAJ |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-19-967733-7|oclc=890807357}}</ref><ref name=":10" />{{page needed | date=March 2025}} Most modern dim sum dishes are commonly associated with [[Cantonese cuisine]], although dim sum dishes also exist in other Chinese cuisines. In the tenth century, when the city of Canton ([[Guangzhou]]) began to experience an increase in commercial travel,<ref name=":0" /> many frequented [[teahouses]] for small-portion meals with tea called "''[[yum cha]]''" ([[brunch]]).<ref name=":11" />{{page needed | date=May 2025}}<ref name=":0" />{{page needed | date=May 2025}}<ref name=":13" />{{page needed | date=May 2025}} "''Yum cha''" includes two related concepts.<ref name=":14" /> The first is "[[One bowl with two pieces|jat zung loeng gin]]" ({{lang-zh|  {{linktext|一盅兩件}}}}), which translates literally as "one cup, two pieces". This refers to the custom of serving teahouse customers two delicately made food items, savory or sweet, to complement their tea. The second is ''dim sum'', which translates literally to "touch the heart", the term used to designate the small food items that accompanied the tea.

Teahouse owners gradually added various snacks called dim sum to their offerings. The practice of having tea with dim sum eventually evolved into the modern "''yum cha''".<ref name=":0" /> Cantonese dim sum culture developed rapidly during the latter half of the nineteenth century in Guangzhou.<ref name=":4" /> Cantonese dim sum was originally based on local foods.<ref name=":4" /> As dim sum continued to develop, chefs introduced influences and traditions from other regions of China.<ref name=":4" /> Cantonese dim sum has a very broad range of flavors, textures, cooking styles, and ingredients<ref name=":4" /> and can be classified into regular items, seasonal offerings, weekly specials, banquet dishes, holiday dishes, house signature dishes, and travel-friendly items, as well as breakfast or lunch foods and late-night snacks.<ref name=":4" />

Some estimates claim that there are at least two thousand types of dim sum in total across China, but only about forty to fifty types are commonly sold outside of China.<ref name=":7">{{Cite web |title=What Is Dim Sum?

Some versions date the legend to the [[Song dynasty|Southern Song dynasty]] (960–1279) after the term's earliest attestation in the ''[[Old Book of Tang|Book of Tang]]'' ({{lang-zh|t=唐書|p=Táng shū |j=Tong4 Syu1}}).<ref name="Su 2011" /> Written in the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] (907–979), the book uses 點心 as a verb instead: 「治妝未畢, 我未及餐, 爾且可點心」({{lang-zh|p="Zhì zhuāng wèi bì, wǒ wèi jí cān, ěr qiě kě diǎn xīn" |j="Zi6 zong1 mei6 bat1, ngo5 mei6 kap6 caan1, ji5 ce2 ho2 dim2 sam1"}}), which translates to "I have not finished preparing myself and am not ready for a proper meal; therefore, you can treat yourself to some small snacks."<ref name="Su 2011" />{{page needed | date=November 2025}} In this context, "dim sum" means "to barely fill your stomach".<ref name="Su 2011" />{{page needed | date=November 2025}} Dim sum dishes are usually associated with "''[[yum cha]]''" ({{lang-zh|t=飲茶 |cy=yám chàh |p=yǐn chá}}), which is known as the [[Cantonese cuisine|Cantonese]] [[brunch]] tradition.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=Yum Cha – Cantonese Tea Brunch Tradition|url=https://www.travelchinaguide.com/chinese-yum-cha.htm|access-date=5 August 2020|website=travelchinaguide.com|archive-date=17 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210117193526/https://www.travelchinaguide.com/chinese-yum-cha.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>'''''<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|last=Gao |first=Sally |title=6 Things You Should Know Before Eating Dim Sum In Hong Kong|url=https://theculturetrip.com/asia/china/hong-kong/articles/six-things-you-should-know-when-eating-dim-sum-in-hong-kong/|access-date=5 August 2020|website=Culture Trip|date=22 November 2016|archive-date=31 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201031201319/https://theculturetrip.com/asia/china/hong-kong/articles/six-things-you-should-know-when-eating-dim-sum-in-hong-kong/|url-status=live}}</ref>'''''  Chinese food historian [[Yan-kit So]] has described dim sum as:<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Jaine |first1=Tom |title=[[The Oxford Companion to Food]] |last2=Vannithone |first2=Soun |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-19-967733-7 |edition=3 |location=New York |publication-date=2014 |oclc=890807357 |author-link=Tom Jaine}}</ref><ref name=":10">{{Cite book|author=So, Yan-kit |title=Classic food of China |date=April 1997|isbn=0-333-56907-5|publisher= [[Macmillan Publishers]] |location=London |oclc=32049410|author-link=Yan-kit So}}</ref><blockquote>Literally translated as "so close to the heart", they are, in reality, a large range of hors d'oeuvres Cantonese people traditionally enjoy in restaurants (previously teahouses) for breakfast and lunch but never for dinner, washed down with tea.

According to etiquette, the person closest to the teapot pours tea for the others. Sometimes, a younger person will serve an older person.

Those receiving tea express thanks by tapping their index and middle fingers twice on the table.<ref name="Millson 2017" /><ref name="Chiang 2019" /> According to one legend, the finger-tapping tradition evolved from an incident when an emperor poured tea for his servant in a public teahouse during a trip where the emperor concealed his identity to mingle with the commoners. Having been instructed by the emperor not to expose his identity to the public, the servant showed gratitude by improvising the finger-tapping gesture instead of what should have been a kowtow, which would have betrayed the emperor's noble status. The practice gradually evolved to represent gratitude for having tea poured by others.

Diners also flip open the lid (of hinged metal tea pots) or offset the tea pot cover (on ceramic tea pots) to signal an empty pot; servers will then refill the pot.<ref name="Dim Sum Guide" /><ref name="Chiang 2019" />

Dim sum is part of the Chinese tradition of [[snack]]s originating from the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279), when royal chefs created various dishes such as minced pheasant, [[Eurasian skylark|lark]] tongue, and [[Chinese desserts|desserts]] made from steamed milk and bean paste.<ref name=":26" /> [[Guangzhou]] experienced an increase in commercial travel in the tenth century<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |last=Gourse |first=Leslie |title=Dim Sum Has Come a Long Way, From Esoteric to Mass Popularity|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1988-03-13-8802290511-story.html|access-date=5 August 2020|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=13 March 1988 |language=en-US}}</ref>{{page needed | date=May 2025}} At that time, travelers would frequent teahouses for small-portion meals with tea called "''yum cha''" or "tea" meals.<ref name=":11">{{cite book|last=Wong |first=Adele |title=Hong Kong Food & Culture: From Dim Sum to Dried Abalone |year=2016 |publisher=Man Mo Media |isbn=978-9887756002}}</ref>{{page needed | date=May 2025}}<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":13">{{Cite news|date=25 October 1981|title=Fare of the Country; Why Dim Sum Is 'Heart's Delight'|language=en-US |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/25/travel/fare-of-the-country-why-dim-sum-is-heart-s-delight.html|access-date=16 August 2020|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=4 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200704133705/https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/25/travel/fare-of-the-country-why-dim-sum-is-heart-s-delight.html|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Yum cha'' includes two related concepts. The first, {{linktext|一盅兩件}}, translates literally as "one cup, two pieces". This refers to the custom of serving teahouse customers two delicately made food items, savory or sweet, to complement their tea. The second, {{linktext|點心}}, which means dim sum, translates literally to "touch the heart" (i.e., heart touching). This is the term used to designate the small food items that accompanied the drinking of tea.<ref name=":14">{{Cite web|date=13 May 2019|title=Jian Dui -- Sesame Balls (煎堆)|url=https://kindredkitchen.ca/2019/05/13/jian-dui-sesame-balls/|access-date=14 August 2020|website=Kindred Kitchen |language=en-CA |archive-date=5 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201005130704/https://www.kindredkitchen.ca/2019/05/13/jian-dui-sesame-balls/|url-status=live}}</ref>

During the thirteenth century, when the [[Mongol conquest of China|Mongols invaded China]], the royal court fled to southern China, bringing a royal influence to the dim sum of [[Guangzhou]].<ref name=":26" /> Guangzhou was a wealthy, large port city that had international visitors, a temperate climate, and a coastline where fresh and tropical ingredients were grown, resulting in an ideal environment for food and entertainment.<ref name=":26" /> In Guangzhou, street vendors and teahouses sold dim sum.<ref name=":26" /> The practice of having tea with dim sum at tea houses eventually evolved into modern ''yum cha''.<ref name=":0" /> While at the teahouses, travelers selected their preferred snacks from carts.<ref name=":0" /> Visitors to tea houses often socialized as they ate, and business people negotiated deals over dim sum.<ref name=":0" />

During the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644), the Tea and Horses Bureau was established to monitor tea production and improve tea quality.<ref name=":26" /> The improvements in tea quality also led to teahouse improvements.<ref name=":26" />

Cantonese dim sum culture developed rapidly during the latter half of the nineteenth century in Guangzhou.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last=Phillips |first=Carolyn |date=1 February 2017|title=Modern Chinese History as Reflected in a Teahouse Mirror|url=https://online.ucpress.edu/gastronomica/article/17/1/56/45126/Modern-Chinese-History-as-Reflected-in-a-Teahouse|journal=[[Gastronomica]]|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=56–65|doi=10.1525/gfc.2017.17.1.56|issn=1529-3262|url-access=subscription}}</ref> Teahouse dining areas were typically located upstairs, and initial dim sum fare included steamed buns.<ref name=":4" /> Eventually, these evolved into specialized dim sum restaurants, and the variety and quality of dim sum dishes rapidly followed suit.<ref name=":4" /> Cantonese dim sum was originally based on local foods such as sweet roast pork called "''char siu''" and fresh [[rice noodles]].<ref name=":4" /> As dim sum continued to develop, chefs introduced influences and traditions from other regions of [[China]], which created a starting point for the wide variety of dim sum available today.<ref name=":4" /> Chefs created a large range of dim sum that even today comprises most of a teahouse's dim sum offerings.<ref name=":4" /> Part of this development included reducing portion sizes of larger dishes originally from northern China, such as stuffed steamed buns, so they could easily be incorporated into the dim sum menu.<ref name=":4" /> The rapid growth in dim sum restaurants was partly because people found the preparation of dim sum dishes to be time-consuming and preferred the convenience of dining out and eating a large variety of baked, steamed, pan-fried, deep-fried, and [[braised]] foods.<ref name=":4" /> Dim sum continued to develop and also spread southward to [[Hong Kong]].<ref>Tam, S. (1997). Eating Metropolitaneity: Hong Kong Identity in yumcha. ''[[Australian Journal of Anthropology]]'', 8(1), 291-306</ref>

Although dim sum is normally considered Cantonese, it includes many additional influences.<ref name=":4" /> Over thousands of years, as people in China migrated in search of different places to live, they carried the recipes of their favorite foods and continued to prepare and serve these dishes.<ref name=":4" /> Many [[Han Chinese]] migrated south, seeking warmer climates.<ref name=":4" /> Settlements took shape in the [[Yangtze River Valley]], the central highlands, and the coastal southeast, including Guangdong.<ref name=":4" /> The influence of [[Suzhou, Jiangsu|Suzhou]] and [[Hangzhou]] is found in vegetarian soy skin rolls and [[pearl meatballs]]. The dessert squares flavored with [[Jujube|red dates]] or wolfberries are influenced by [[Beijing]] desserts.<ref name=":4" /> Savory dishes, such as [[Jiaozi|pot stickers]] and steamed dumplings, include Muslim influences because of people traveling from Central Asia across the [[Silk Road]] and into Guangdong.<ref name=":4" /> These are just a few examples of how a wide range of influences became incorporated into traditional Cantonese dim sum.<ref name=":4" />

By 1860, foreign influences had shaped Guangdong's dim sum with culinary innovations such as [[ketchup]], [[Worcestershire sauce]], and curry, all of which came to be used in some savory dishes.<ref name=":4" /> [[Custard]] pies evolved into the miniature classics found in every teahouse.<ref name=":4" /> Other dim sum dishes evolved from Indian [[samosas]], [[mango]] puddings, and Mexican [[Concha (bread)|conchas]] (snow-topped buns).<ref name=":4" /> Cantonese-style dim sum has an extremely broad range of tastes, textures, cooking styles, and ingredients.<ref name=":4" /> As a result, there are more than a thousand different varieties of dim sum.<ref name=":4" />

During the 1920s, in Guangzhou, the foremost places to enjoy tea were its tea pavilions, which had refined and expansive surroundings.<ref name=":4" /> The customers were wealthy, and there were rather high standards for the privilege of enjoying tea pavilion service and dim sum.<ref name=":4" /> Upon entering a tea pavilion, customers would inspect tea leaves to ensure their quality and to verify the water temperature.<ref name=":4" /> Once satisfied, these guests were presented with a pencil and a booklet listing the available dim sum.<ref name=":4" /> A waiter would then tear their orders out of the booklet so that the kitchen could pan-fry, steam, bake, or deep-fry these dishes on demand.<ref name=":4" /> Customers dined upstairs in privacy and comfort.<ref name=":4" /> Servers carefully balanced the dishes on their arms or arranged them on trays as they climbed up and down the stairs.<ref name=":4" /> Eventually, dim sum carts were used to serve the steamers and plates.<ref name=":4" />

People with average incomes also enjoyed tea and dim sum.<ref name=":4" /> Early every morning, customers visited inexpensive restaurants that offered filled steamed buns and hot tea.<ref name=":4" /> During the mid-morning, students and government employees ordered two or three kinds of dim sum and ate as they read their newspapers.<ref name=":4" /> In the late morning, people working at small businesses visited restaurants for breakfast and to use the restaurant as a small office space.<ref name=":4" />

By the late 1930s, Guangzhou's teahouse culture included four high-profile dim sum chefs, with signs at the front doors of their restaurants.<ref name=":4" /> There was heavy competition among teahouses, and as a result, new varieties of dim sum were invented almost daily, including dishes influenced by the tea pastries of Shanghai, Beijing, and the [[Western world]].<ref name=":4" /> Many new fusion dishes were also created, including puddings, baked rolls, turnovers, custard tarts, and Malay steamed cakes.<ref name=":4" />

There were also significant increases in the variety of thin wrappers used in both sweet and savory items.<ref name=":4" /><blockquote>If we concentrate only on the changes and developments in the variety of wrappers, the main types of dim sum wrappers during the 1920s included such things as raised (for filled buns), wheat starch, ''shao mai'' (i.e., egg dough), crystal bun, crispy batter, sticky rice, and boiled dumpling wrappers. By the 1930s, the varieties of wrappers commonly used by chefs included puff pastry, Cantonese short pastry, and so on, for a total of 23 types that were prepared by pan-frying, deep-frying, steaming, baking, and roasting.<ref name=":4" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Feng |first=Mingquan |year=1986|title=A discussion on Guangzhou's teahouse industry.

While some Chinese restaurants in the U.S. had offered dim sum for decades, it was not until the late 1980s that there was a broader public awareness of dim sum.<ref name=":0" />

Although there was increased awareness of dim sum around this time, one chef from Hong Kong, who immigrated to San Francisco, noted that diners in the U.S. usually focused on the food itself and not the communal aspects of eating dim sum.<ref name=":6">{{Cite magazine|title=How to Order Dim Sum, According to the Head Chef of the First Chinese Restaurant in North America to Receive a Michelin Star|url=https://time.com/5750814/dim-sum-ordering-guide/|access-date=19 August 2020|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |archive-date=19 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819075135/https://time.com/5750814/dim-sum-ordering-guide/|url-status=live}}</ref> Although dim sum is a Chinese meal, it is a communal dining and social experience that can span hours.<ref name=":6" /> It is customary for large groups to enjoy dishes together as a leisurely social activity.<ref name=":6" /> Diners go to restaurants early, around 10:00&nbsp;AM, and rather than ordering a whole table of food, they order small amounts, have a cup of tea, read the newspaper, and wait for friends and family to join them.<ref name=":6" /> As a result, a visit to a dim sum restaurant can last from late morning well into the afternoon.<ref name=":6" /> For some people in Hong Kong, eating dim sum is a daily routine and a way of life.<ref name=":6" /> Since this dim sum tradition is not always present in some U.S. dim sum restaurants, however, approaches to generate interest and attract customers include customized seasoning and flavors of traditional dishes, as well as creating novel dishes with an emphasis on enhanced flavors and visual appeal.<ref name=":6" />
