'''Rice and beans''', or '''beans and rice''', is a category of dishes from many cultures around the world where the [[staple food]]s of [[rice]] and [[beans]] are combined in some manner. The grain and legume combination provides several important [[nutrients]] and many [[calories]], and both foods are widely available. The beans are usually seasoned, while the rice may be plain or seasoned. If the beans do not top the rice, the two components may be mixed together, separated on the plate, or served separately.

==Description==
[[File:Rajma, kidney beans, served with chawal, rice.jpg|thumb|[[Kidney bean]]s and rice]]
The dish usually consists of [[white rice|white]] or [[brown rice]] accompanied by cooked [[Brown bean|brown]], [[Kidney bean|red]] or [[Black turtle bean|black]] dry [[bean]]s (typically ''[[Common bean|Phaseolus vulgaris]]'' or ''[[Cowpea|Vigna unguiculata]]'') and [[seasoning|seasoned]] in various ways. This dish is also commonly served with sides of stewed chicken, [[pork]], [[beef]], [[potato salad]], [[boiled potatoes]], and many other sides from many different cultures. In many areas, beans and rice are often served side by side rather than combined.  Either way, they may be considered a meal, frequently with a topping of [[meat]] or [[Chicken as food|chicken]].  Meat or other ingredients are sometimes placed atop beans and rice or, less frequently, mixed into it.

Different regions have different preferences. In [[Nicaragua]], for example, red beans are more popular while cooking [[Gallo pinto]], while in [[Costa Rica]] black beans are. Also, in [[Brazil]], black beans are more popular in [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]],  [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]] and [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], while in most other parts of the country these are mostly only used in [[feijoada]]s.  The [[New Orleans]] specialty known as "[[red beans and rice]]" is often accompanied by a side of smoked [[sausage]] or a fried [[pork chop]].

==History==
===The Americas===
Genetic analyses of the common bean ''Phaseolus'' shows  that it originated in Mesoamerica, and subsequently spread southward, along with [[maize]] and [[Cucurbita|squash]], traditional companion crops.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1108973109 | volume=109 | title=Mesoamerican origin of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is revealed by sequence data | year=2012 | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | pages=E788–E796 | issue=14 | pmid=22393017 | pmc=3325731 | doi-access=free | last1=Bitocchi | first1=Elena | last2=Nanni | first2=Laura | last3=Bellucci | first3=Elisa | last4=Rossi | first4=Monica | last5=Giardini | first5=Alessandro | last6=Zeuli | first6=Pierluigi Spagnoletti | last7=Logozzo | first7=Giuseppina | last8=Stougaard | first8=Jens | last9=McClean | first9=Phillip | last10=Attene | first10=Giovanna | last11=Papa | first11=Roberto }}</ref>   [[Asian rice]] was introduced to Latin America during the colonial era by the Spanish and the Portuguese.  However, it has recently been discovered that the indigenous peoples of the Amazon had already cultivated a distant relative of Asian rice of the same genus [[Oryza]] some 4,000 years ago,<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0322-4 | doi=10.1038/s41559-017-0322-4 | title=Evidence for mid-Holocene rice domestication in the Americas | year=2017 | last1=Hilbert | first1=Lautaro | last2=Neves | first2=Eduardo Góes | last3=Pugliese | first3=Francisco | last4=Whitney | first4=Bronwen S. | last5=Shock | first5=Myrtle | last6=Veasey | first6=Elizabeth | last7=Zimpel | first7=Carlos Augusto | last8=Iriarte | first8=José | journal=Nature Ecology & Evolution | volume=1 | issue=11 | pages=1693–1698 | pmid=28993622 | bibcode=2017NatEE...1.1693H | s2cid=256727214 | hdl=10871/33891 | hdl-access=free | url-access=subscription }}</ref> and were growing it alongside maize and squash, traditional companion crops of beans, which were also by that time present in South America.

==Nutritional significance==
Beans and rice are both nutritious ingredients. Rice is rich in [[starch]], making it a good source of energy. Rice also has [[iron]] and some [[protein]]. Beans also contain [[iron]] and a greater amount of protein in comparison to rice. Together they make up a [[complete protein]], which provides large quantities of each of the [[amino acid]]s the body cannot produce by itself.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cornellhealthcarereview.org/post/the-role-of-rice-and-beans-nutrition-as-medical-treatment |title=The Role of Rice and Beans: Nutrition as Medical Treatment |last=Schacter |first=Illana |date=2021-08-28 |website=The Cornell Healthcare Review |access-date=2023-05-04 |publisher=[[Cornell University]] |quote="Forming a complete protein and supplying all nine essential amino acids, rice and beans have been a staple food for millennia."}}</ref> Their [[amino acid profile]]s complement each other when [[Protein combining|combined]], meaning that such dishes were acknowledged as beneficial protein in [[vegetarian]] terms.

==Culture==
In some [[Latin America]]n states and countries, beans and rice are commonly eaten as everyday lunch, along with a different variety of meats and vegetables. It is also common to prepare dinner using the lunch leftovers.  Beans and rice are especially popular in Brazil, which is the world's third largest producer of dry beans<ref>{{cite web|title=Countries by commodity -- Beans, Dry|url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#rankings/countries_by_commodity|website=FAOSTAT|publisher=[[FAO]]|access-date=24 May 2018|date=2016}}</ref> and the largest consumer of rice in the [[Americas]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rice around the world -- Brasil|url=http://www.fao.org/rice2004/en/p1.htm|website=International Year of Rice|publisher=[[FAO]]|access-date=24 May 2018|date=2004|archive-date=19 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819182218/http://www.fao.org/rice2004/en/p1.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref>
