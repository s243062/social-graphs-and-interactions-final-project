The '''bacon and egg pie''' is a savoury [[pie]] consisting of a crust containing [[bacon]], [[egg (food)|egg]] and sometimes [[onion]], [[mushroom]]s, [[bell pepper]]s, [[pea]]s, [[tomato]], fresh herbs and [[cheese]].  Bacon and egg pie may be served with [[ketchup]], which can be combined with [[Worcestershire sauce]] and drizzled over the filling before the pie is baked<ref>{{cite web|title=Famous New Zealand Bacon & Egg also known as quiche Pie|url=https://www.food.com/recipe/famous-new-zealand-bacon-egg-pie-201918|access-date=14 June 2012}}</ref> and some versions have a rising agent such as [[baking powder]] mixed into the egg to make a fluffier filling.

==Composition==
The pie is often constructed with [[shortcrust pastry]] or other stable base crust. The crust is usually topped with a pastry lid,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deliaonline.com/recipes/bacon-and-egg-pies,1761,RC.html|title=Bacon and Egg Pies|date=9 November 2015|work=deliaonline.com|access-date=18 June 2016}}</ref> but is sometimes left open.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes|title=Recipes|work=bettycrocker.com|access-date=18 June 2016}}</ref>

A bacon and egg pie differs from a [[quiche]], most notably due to the absence of [[cheese]] and [[milk]] and the presence of an upper crust. Also the eggs are not beaten and are whole, or at the most yolks pierced. The pie also tends to have a heavier texture and feel, and is generally high in calories.

Although the bacon and egg combination is not unique to any country, its use in modern cooking is notable in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada and Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theculturetrip.com/pacific/new-zealand/articles/a-brief-history-of-the-new-zealand-meat-pie/|title=A Brief History of The New Zealand Meat Pie|author=Thalita Alves|date=2017-05-07|publisher=Culture Trip}}</ref> Recipes for it have been found as early as ''[[The Experienced English Housekeeper]]'' in 1769.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11722297|title=Tui Flower shares a slice of bacon and egg pie history|author=Sarah Harris|date=9 October 2016|work=New Zealand Herald|access-date=20 May 2017}}</ref>
