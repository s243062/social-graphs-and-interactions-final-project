==History==
[[File:Thành phố Nam Định xưa - Nhìn từ trên cao.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nam Định]] City in 1900]]

Phở originated in [[Northern Vietnam]] in the early 20th century. It either evolved independently from, or shares a similar origin with, beef noodle soups found in neighboring countries, where dishes such as [[boat noodles|kuay teow reua]] of Thailand or ''ngau naam ho fun'' ({{Lang|zh|牛腩河粉}}) and ''niu pahu'' ({{Lang|zh|牛扒呼}}) of [[Guangdong]] and [[Yunnan]] provinces of China, are common. While the [[rice noodles]] and the spices used in the broth of phở have a connection with Chinese culinary traditions, beef consumption was not widespread among the Vietnamese because they traditionally used [[Water buffalo|water buffaloes]] for farming. The demand for beef only appeared under [[French Indochina|French colonial rule]], leading some to attribute phở’s origins to French, Chinese, or a combination of both influences.<ref name=":0" /> However, its exact origins remain a topic of debate. 

During French colonial rule (1887–1954), the French introduced [[pot-au-feu]], a slow-cooked beef stew, and the use of beef bones for broth mirrors French [[consommé]] techniques.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Dish Spotlight: The Multicultural Origins of Vietnamese Beef Pho |url=https://guide.michelin.com/en/article/dining-out/%E8%A3%BD%E4%BD%9C%E5%87%BA%E8%89%B2%E8%B6%8A%E5%8D%97%E6%B2%B3pho |access-date=2025-02-04 |website=MICHELIN Guide |language=en-US}}</ref> However dishes with a similar preparation to phở using water buffalo meat, such as ''xáo trâu'' have long been staples to the rural cuisine. Villagers in {{lang|vi|Vân Cù|italic=no}} say they ate phở long before the [[French colonial Vietnam|French colonial period]].<ref name="HNM Nguyen Ngoc Tien" /> The modern form emerged between 1900 and 1907 in northern [[Vietnam]],<ref name="Trinh Quang Dung" /><ref name="evolution1" /> southeast of [[Hanoi]] in [[Nam Định Province]], then a substantial [[textile]] market. The traditional home of phở is reputed to be the villages of {{lang|vi|Vân Cù|italic=no}} and {{lang|vi|Dao Cù|italic=no}} (or {{lang|vi|Giao Cù|italic=no}}) in Đông Xuân commune, [[Nam Trực District]], Nam Định Province.<ref name="HNM Nguyen Ngoc Tien">{{cite news|title=Phở Hà Nội|trans-title=Hanoi Pho|author= Nguyễn Ngọc Tiến|work= [[Hànộimới]] |publisher=[[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist Party Committee of Hanoi]]|date=2 August 2011|access-date=19 May 2013|url= http://hanoimoi.com.vn/Tin-tuc/Phong-su-Ky-su/518889/pho-ha-noi |language=vi}}</ref><ref name="ANTG An Chi">{{cite news|title=Lai lịch của món phở và tên gọi của nó|trans-title=Origin of the phở dish and its name|author=An Chi<!-- pseudonym -->|work=[[Báo Công an Nhân dân|An Ninh Thế Giới]]|publisher=[[Ministry of Public Security (Vietnam)|Vietnam Ministry of Public Security]]|date=2010-06-15 |access-date=2013-05-18|url=http://antg.cand.com.vn/vi-vn/ktvhkh/2010/6/72558.cand|language=vi}}</ref>

Cultural historian and researcher Trịnh Quang Dũng believes that the popularization and origins of modern pho stemmed from the intersection of several historical and cultural factors in the early 20th century.<ref name="TQD">{{citation |author=Trịnh Quang Dũng |title=100 năm Phở Việt |year=2011|journal=Văn Hóa Học|url= http://www.vanhoahoc.vn/nghien-cuu/van-hoa-viet-nam/van-hoa-ung-xu-voi-moi-truong-tu-nhien/1994-trinh-quang-dung-100-nam-pho-viet.html |access-date=2016-07-16}}</ref> These include improved availability of beef due to French demand, which in turn produced beef bones that were purchased by Chinese workers to make into a beef noodle similar to phở called {{lang|vi|ngưu nhục phấn}} (牛肉粉 or 牛腩粉) or ''ngau juk fun''.<ref name="TQD" /><ref name="NA">{{citation |last=Nguyen |first=Andrea |title=The History of Pho |journal=Lucky Peach |year=2016 |url= http://luckypeach.com/the-history-of-pho-andrea-nguyen/ |access-date=2016-07-16 |url-status=usurped |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160719133915/http://luckypeach.com/the-history-of-pho-andrea-nguyen/ |archive-date=2016-07-19 }}</ref> The Yunnan-style herbal beef soup is called ''niupahu'' (牛扒呼) or ''ngau paa fu'' in Cantonese.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://curatedkitchenware.com/blogs/soupeduprecipes/yunnan-style-beef-soup |title=Yunnan-Style Beef Soup }}</ref> The demand for this dish was initially the greatest with workers from the provinces of Yunnan and Guangdong, who had an affinity for the dish due to its similarities to that of their homeland, which eventually popularized and familiarized this dish with the general population.<ref name="NA" />

Phở was originally sold as a snack at dawn and dusk by [[street vendors]], who shouldered mobile kitchens on [[carrying pole]]s ({{lang|vi|gánh phở}}).<ref name="CVCN Nguyen Du" /> From the pole hung two wooden cabinets, one housing a cauldron over a wood fire, the other storing noodles, spices, cookware, and space to prepare a bowl of phở. The heavy {{lang|vi|gánh}} was always shouldered by men.<ref name="Vu Hong Lien">{{cite book|title=Rice and Baguette: A History of Food in Vietnam|author=Vu Hong Lien|location=London|publisher=[[Reaktion Books]]|year=2016|page=147|isbn=9781780237046|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UJGEDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT147|via=Google Books|quote=Mobile ''phở'' was always sold by men, probably because the stockpot was too heavy for a woman to shoulder.}}</ref> They kept their heads warm with distinctive felt hats called {{lang|vi|mũ phở}}.<ref name="Bui Minh Duc" />

Hanoi's first two fixed phở stands were a Vietnamese-owned Cát Tường on Cầu Gỗ Street and a Chinese-owned stand in front of Bờ Hồ tram stop. They were joined in 1918 by two more on Quạt Row and Đồng Row.<ref name="KHPT Trinh Quang Dung 2">{{cite news |author=Trịnh Quang Dũng |date=15 January 2010 |title=Phở muôn màu muôn vẻ |trans-title=Pho has various colors and numerous different styles |url=http://www.khoahocphothong.com.vn/newspaper/detail/4156/100-nam-pho-viet.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303220343/http://www.khoahocphothong.com.vn/newspaper/detail/4156/100-nam-pho-viet.html |archive-date=3 March 2016 |access-date=22 May 2013 |work=Báo Khoa Học Phổ Thông |publisher=Ho Chi Minh City Union of Science and Technology Associations |language=vi}}</ref> Around 1925, a Vân Cù villager named Vạn opened the first "[[Nam Định]] style" pho stand in [[Hanoi]].<ref name="KHPT Trinh Quang Dung" /> Peddler {{lang|vi|phở gánh}} declined in number around 1936–1946 in favor of stationary eateries.<ref name="Bui Minh Duc" />

===Development===
[[File:Pho in Saigon.jpg|thumb|right|Southern-style phở served with basil and mung bean sprouts]]

In the late 1920s, various vendors experimented with {{lang|vi|[[húng lìu]]}}, [[sesame oil]], [[tofu]], and even ''[[Lethocerus indicus]]'' extract ({{lang|vi|cà cuống}}). This "{{lang|vi|phở cải lương}}" failed to enter the mainstream.<ref name="KHPT Trinh Quang Dung 2" /><ref name="Thach Lam">{{cite wikisource |author=Thạch Lam |authorlink=Thạch Lam |chapter=Phụ thêm vào phở |trans-chapter=Adding to pho |title=Hà Nội băm sáu phố phường |trans-title=Hanoi: 36 streets and districts |publisher=Đời Nay Publishing House |year=1943 |wslanguage=vi |wslink=Hà Nội băm sáu phố phường}}</ref>

{{lang|vi|Phở tái}}, served with cooked beef, had been introduced by 1930. Chicken pho appeared in 1939, possibly because beef was not sold at the markets on Mondays and Fridays at the time.<ref name="KHPT Trinh Quang Dung 2" />

With the [[partition of Vietnam]] in 1954, over a million people fled [[North Vietnam]] for [[South Vietnam]]. Phở, which was relatively less consumed in the South, suddenly became popular.<ref name="ANTG An Chi" /> No longer confined to northern culinary traditions, variations in meat and broth appeared, and additional garnishes, such as lime, [[mung bean sprout]]s ({{lang|vi|giá đỗ}}), [[Eryngium foetidum|culantro]] ({{lang|vi|ngò gai}}), [[cinnamon basil]] ({{lang|vi|húng quế}}), [[Hoisin sauce]] ({{lang|vi|tương đen}}), and hot [[Sriracha|Sriracha sauce]] ({{lang|vi|tương ớt}}) became standard fare.<ref name="evolution1"/><ref name="ANTG An Chi" /><ref name="KHPT Trinh Quang Dung 2" /> {{lang|vi|Phở tái}} also began to rival fully cooked {{lang|vi|phở chín}}{{what|date=May 2025}} in popularity. Migrants from the North similarly popularized {{lang|vi|[[bánh mì]]}} sandwiches.<ref name="Lê Văn Nghĩa">{{cite news|title=Chuyện xưa – chuyện nay: Bánh mì Sài Gòn trong thơ|trans-title=Then and now: Saigon sandwiches in poetry|author=Lê Văn Nghĩa|work=[[Tuổi Trẻ]]|publisher=Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union|date=June 11, 2017|access-date=April 3, 2018|url= https://dulich.tuoitre.vn/du-lich/chuyen-xua-chuyen-nay-banh-mi-sai-gon-trong-tho-1329645.htm|language=vi}}</ref>

Meanwhile, in North Vietnam, private phở restaurants were nationalized ({{lang|vi|mậu dịch quốc doanh}})<ref name="Gibb" /> and began serving phở noodles made from old rice. Street vendors were forced to use noodles made of imported [[Potato starch|potato flour]].<ref name="Xuan Phuong">{{cite book|title=Ao Dai: My War, My Country, My Vietnam|author=Xuan Phuong|first2=Danièle|last2= Mazingarbe|editor1-first=Jonathan E.|editor1-last=Myers|translator= Lynn M.

During the so-called [[Economic history of Vietnam#Subsidy phase: 1976-1986|subsidy period]] following the Vietnam War, state-owned pho eateries served a meatless variety of the dish known as pilotless pho ({{lang|vi|phở không người lái}}),<ref name="BBC Hoàng Linh">{{cite news|title=Tản mạn về Phở|trans-title=Ramblings about Phở |author=Hoàng Linh|work=BBC Vietnamese|date=March 5, 2009 |access-date=May 16, 2013 |url= https://www.bbc.com/vietnamese/culture/2009/03/090305_pho_hoanglinh |language=vi}}</ref> in reference to the U.S. Air Force's [[History of unmanned aerial vehicles#Vietnam War: Reconnaissance drones|unmanned reconnaissance drone]]s.

Pho eateries were privatized as part of [[Doi Moi|Đổi Mới]]. Many street vendors must still maintain a light footprint to evade police enforcing the street tidiness rules that replaced the ban on private ownership.<ref name="Guardian Renton" />

=== Globalization ===

In the aftermath of the [[Vietnam War]], [[Overseas Vietnamese|Vietnamese refugee]]s brought phở to many countries.

In the [[United States]], phở began to enter the mainstream during the 1990s, as [[United States–Vietnam relations|relations between the U.S. and Vietnam]] improved.<ref name="LAT Loh" /> At that time Vietnamese restaurants began opening quickly in Texas and California, spreading rapidly along the Gulf and West Coasts, as well as the East Coast and the rest of the country.

=== Modern era ===
In recent decades, phở has evolved beyond its traditional form, with new variations emerging to cater to modern tastes and preferences. One notable innovation is phở cuốn,<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-09-09 |title=Phở : A Complete History of Vietnam's Most Renowned Dish |url=https://amthuchiendai.vn/en/pho-a-complete-history-of-vietnams-most-renowned-dish/ |access-date=2024-10-02 |website=Ẩm Thực Hiện Đại |language=en-US}}</ref> where the ingredients of phở are wrapped in fresh rice noodles, creating a new dish that has gained popularity in Hanoi.

Phở's influence has even extended into the cocktail scene, with bars like Nê offering phở-inspired cocktails that incorporate the soup’s signature spices.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-04-12 |title=Pho cocktail based on Vietnamese beef noodle soup a hit at Hanoi bar |url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/travel-leisure/article/2141096/pho-glass-cocktail-based-vietnamese-beef-noodle-soup-hip |access-date=2024-10-02 |website=South China Morning Post |language=en}}</ref>

Additionally, chefs such as Peter Cung have brought phở into the realm of fine dining, as exemplified by his Michelin-starred restaurant Anan Saigon, where phở is deconstructed into a multi-course meal.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-04-26 |title=Michelin-starred restaurant in HCM City among world's best |url=https://english.vov.vn/en/travel/michelin-starred-restaurant-in-hcm-city-among-worlds-best-post1091620.vov |access-date=2024-10-02 |website=VOV.VN |language=en}}</ref>

Official recognition has followed suit, with the Vietnamese government designating December 12 as the 'Day of Phở' in 2018, and in 2024, Hanoi and Nam Định-style phở were recognized as national intangible cultural heritage.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-08-13 |title=Local noodle soup designated as national intangible cultural heritage |url=https://vietnamnews.vn/life-style/1661093/local-noodle-soup-designated-as-national-intangible-cultural-heritage.html |access-date=2024-10-02 |website=vietnamnews.vn |language=en}}</ref> These developments reflect the dish’s enduring relevance and its continued reinvention in both local and international culinary landscapes.

Possibly the earliest English-language reference to pho was in the book ''Recipes of All Nations'', edited by [[Countess Morphy]] in 1935: In the book, pho is described as "an [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annamese]] soup held in high esteem ... made with beef, a veal bone, onions, a bay leaf, salt, and pepper, and a small teaspoon of [[nuoc mam|''nuoc-mam'']] ([[fish sauce]])''."<ref name="morphy">{{cite book| last=Morphy| first=Marcelle (countess)| year=1935|chapter=Dishes from many lands|title=Recipes of All Nations|publisher=Wm.

There are two prevailing theories on the origin of the word {{lang|vi|phở}} and, by extension, the dish itself. As author Nguyễn Dư<!-- no relation to [[Nguyễn Dữ]] --> notes, both questions are significant to Vietnamese identity.<ref name="CVCN Nguyen Du">{{cite journal|title=Phở, phởn, phịa ...|trans-title=Pho, euphoria, innovation...|author=Nguyễn Dư|journal=Chim Việt Cành Nam|date=February 2001|access-date=18 May 2013|url=http://chimviet.free.fr/nddg/nddg061.htm|language=vi}}</ref>

Some historians suggest a connection to the French due to the introduction of beef as a staple ingredient during French colonial rule.<ref name=":0" /> French settlers commonly ate beef, whereas Vietnamese traditionally ate pork and chicken and used cattle primarily as [[Working animal|beasts of burden]].<ref name="Gibb" /><ref name="NYT Apple">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/13/dining/asian-journey-looking-up-an-old-love-on-the-streets-of-vietnam.html|title=Asian Journey; Looking Up an Old Love On the Streets of Vietnam|last=Apple| first=Raymond Walter Jr. |date=13 August 2003|work=[[The New York Times]]|author-link=R.

Many Hanoians explain that the word {{lang|fr|phở}} derives from French soldiers' ordering "{{lang|fr|feu}}" (fire) from {{lang|vi|gánh phở}}, referring to both the steam rising from a bowl of phở and the wood fire seen glowing from a {{lang|vi|gánh phở}} in the evening.<ref name="Bui Minh Duc" />

Food historian Erica J. Peters argues that the French has embraced phở in a way that overlooks its origins as a local improvisation, reinforcing "an idea that the French brought modern ingenuity to a traditionalist Vietnam".<ref name="Peters Defusing">{{Cite journal | last1 = Peters | first1 = Erica J. | title = Defusing Phở: Soup Stories and Ethnic Erasures, 1919–2009 | doi = 10.1080/17409291003644255 | journal = Contemporary French and Francophone Studies | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 159–167 | year = 2010 | s2cid = 191343325 }}</ref> The connection between phở and the French culinary tradition remains widely debated but remains a prominent theory in discussions of its origins.<ref name=":0" />

===From Cantonese===

Another possible origin links phở to Chinese influences. Hue and Eugène Gouin (1957) suggest that {{lang|vi|phở}} may be a shortened form of {{lang|vi|lục phở}} and that it is derived from {{lang|vi|ngưu nhục phấn}} ({{Lang-zh|c=牛肉粉|cy=ngàuh yuhk fán}}), which means "beef noodles". This dish was sold by Chinese immigrants in Hanoi. This etymology is supported by the 1931 dictionary definition of phở and the influence of Chinese culinary traditions, including the use of rice noodles and spices in the broth.<ref name="Vuong Trung Hieu" /> ({{IPA|[ɲ]}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/l/}} in some northern dialects of Vietnamese.)

Some scholars argue that phở (the dish) evolved from {{lang|vi|xáo trâu}}, a Vietnamese dish common in Hanoi at the turn of the century. Originally eaten by commoners near the [[Red River (Asia)|Red River]], it consisted of stir-fried strips of [[water buffalo]] meat served in broth atop [[rice vermicelli]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Trăm Năm Truyện Thăng Long – Hà Nội|author=Siêu Hải|publisher=Youth Publishing House|year=2000|pages=373–375|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzdwAAAAMAAJ|language=vi|quote=Nguồn gốc của nó là món canh thịt trâu xáo hành răm ăn với bún.

==Ingredients and preparation==
{{Cookbook|Phở}}

Phở is served in a bowl with a specific cut of flat [[rice noodles]] in clear beef [[broth]], with thin cuts of beef (steak, fatty [[flank steak|flank]], lean flank, [[brisket]]). Variations feature slow-cooked [[tendon as food|tendons]], [[tripe]], or [[meatball]]s in southern Vietnam. Chicken pho is made using the same spices as beef, but the broth is made using chicken bones and meat, as well as some internal organs of the chicken, such as the heart, the undeveloped eggs, and the gizzard.<ref name="town"/><ref name="pho-mytran"/>

When eating at phở stalls in Vietnam, customers are generally asked which parts of the beef they would like and how they want it done.

Pho noodles are usually medium-wide; however, people from different regions of Vietnam prefer different widths.

===Broth===
[[File:Pho-Beef-Noodles-2008.jpg|thumb|right|Phở served with beef [[brisket]] in Australia]]
The soup for beef phở is generally made by simmering beef bones, [[oxtail]]s, flank steak, charred onion, charred ginger, and spices. For a more intense flavor, the bones may still have beef on them. Chicken bones also work and produce a similar broth. Seasonings can include [[Saigon cinnamon]] or other kinds of cinnamon as alternatives (may be used usually in stick form, sometimes in powder form in pho restaurant franchises overseas), [[star anise]], roasted [[ginger]], roasted [[onion]], [[black cardamom]], [[coriander]] seed, [[fennel]] seed, and [[clove]].<ref>{{Cite AV media| people = Jamie Oliver| title = Vietnamese 'Pho Ga' Chicken Noodle Soup | accessdate = 2018-07-15| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHapXkBNuTc}}</ref> The broth takes several hours to make.<ref name="pho-mytran" /> For chicken phở, only the meat and bones of the chicken are used in place of beef and beef bone. The remaining spices remain the same, but the charred ginger can be omitted since its function in beef phở is to subdue the quite strong smell of beef.

[[File:Pho packet.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A typical phở spice packet, sold at many Asian food markets, containing a soaking bag plus various necessary dry spices. The exact amount differs with each bag.]]

The spices, often wrapped in [[cheesecloth]] or a soaking bag to prevent them from floating all over the pot, usually contain cloves, star anise, coriander seed, fennel, cinnamon, black cardamom, ginger, and onion.

Careful cooks often roast ginger and onion over an open fire for about a minute before adding them to the stock, to bring out their full flavor. They also skim off all the impurities that float to the top while cooking; this is the key to a clear broth. {{lang|vi|Nước mắm}} ([[fish sauce]]) is added toward the end.

===Garnishes===
[[File:Phingredients in Ho Chi Min City.jpg|thumb|Typical garnishes for {{lang|vi|phở Sài Gòn}}, clockwise from top left are: onions, chili peppers, [[eryngium foetidum|culantro]], lime, bean sprouts, and [[Thai basil]].]]

Different regions have different ways of eating pho that suit their taste and practice. The Northern pho is typically served with [[scallion]]s, [[onion]]s, and [[coriander|cilantro (coriander leaves)]]. The Southern variant also adds [[Thai basil]] and [[bean sprout]]s. Thai [[chili pepper]]s, [[lime (fruit)|lime]] wedges, [[fish sauce]], [[chili oil]], hot [[chili sauce]] (such as [[Sriracha sauce]]), pickled garlic (Northern style), or [[hoisin sauce]] (Southern style) may be added to taste as accompaniments.<ref name="BBC">{{cite journal|last=Leung|first=Iris|title=A pilgrimage for perfect pho|journal=[[BBC]]|date=9 December 2016|access-date=2 February 2023|url=https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20161205-a-pilgrimage-for-perfect-pho}}</ref><ref name="pho-mytran" /><ref name="BonAppetit Gross">{{cite journal|last=Gross|first=Matt|title=The Annoying Food Snob's Guide to Eating Pho With Sriracha|journal=[[Bon Appétit]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|date=6 March 2014|access-date=2 January 2015|url=http://www.bonappetit.com/restaurants-travel/article/pho-with-sriracha|archive-date=3 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103095247/http://www.bonappetit.com/restaurants-travel/article/pho-with-sriracha|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Central pho is more special.

Several ingredients not generally served with phở may be ordered by request. Extra-fatty broth (''nước béo'') can be ordered and comes with scallions to sweeten it. A popular side dish ordered upon request is ''hành dấm'', or vinegared white onions.

==Styles of pho==
===Regional variants===
[[File:Street vendor pho ga Hanoi.jpg|thumb|upright|Chicken phở at a typical street stall in Hanoi. The lack of side garnishes is typical of northern Vietnamese-style cooking.]]

The several regional variants of pho in Vietnam, particularly divided between "Northern phở" ('''{{lang|vi|phở Bắc}}''') or "Hanoi phở" ('''''phở Hà Nội'''''), and "Southern phở" ('''''phở Nam''''') or "Saigon pho" ('''{{lang|vi|phở Sài Gòn}}'''). Northern Vietnamese phở uses a savoury, clear broth, blanched whole [[scallion|green onion]], and garnishes offered generally include only diced green onion and cilantro, pickled garlic, chili sauce and ''[[youtiao|quẩy]]''. The Northern pho is often described as subtle and light on spices while having a deep savory taste from beef bones.<ref name="BBC Travel">{{cite web|title = A pilgrimage for perfect pho|url = https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20161205-a-pilgrimage-for-perfect-pho|website = [[BBC]]| date=25 February 2022 |access-date = 10 March 2023}}</ref><ref name="BBC Travel 2">{{cite web|title = Pho: The humble soup that caused an outrage|url = https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20210421-pho-the-humble-soup-that-caused-an-outrage|website = [[BBC]]| date=22 April 2021 |access-date = 10 March 2023}}</ref> On the other hand, southern Vietnamese phở broth is sweeter and cloudier, and is consumed with bean sprouts, fresh sliced chili, hoisin sauce, and a greater variety of fresh herbs.

Vietnamese beef soup can also refer to {{lang|vi|[[bún bò Huế]]}}, which is a spicy beef noodle soup associated with {{lang|vi|[[Huế]]|italic=no}} in central Vietnam.

===Outside Vietnam===
After the [[Fall of Saigon]] in 1975, the [[Philippines]] welcomed refugees into its territories, resulting in thousands of Vietnamese from southern Vietnam taking shelter on the Filipino island of [[Palawan]]. The Vietnamese immigrants brought with them part of their culture which influenced the Filipinos of the island, and vice versa. A notable culinary legacy is a pho-like Filipino dish popular in Palawan island that locals call '''chao long''' (not to be confused with the Vietnamese porridge called ''chao long''). The Filipino ''chao long'' is a noodle dish, which is a combination of broth, protein (beef, pork, and/or chicken), rice noodles, mung bean sprouts, and basil leaves.
