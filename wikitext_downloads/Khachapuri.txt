'''Khachapuri''' ({{lang-ka|ხაჭაპური|tr}} {{IPA|ka|ˈχatʃʼapʼuɾi||Khachapuri.ogg}} from {{Lang|ka|ხაჭო}} {{transliteration|ka|khachʼo}} {{IPA|ka|ˈχat͡ʃʼo|}} 'curd' + {{lang|ka|პური}} {{transliteration|ka|pʼuri}} {{IPA|ka|ˈpʼuri|}} 'bread') is a traditional [[Georgian cuisine|Georgian dish]] of cheese-filled bread. The bread is [[Bread#Leavening|leavened]] and allowed to rise, molded into various shapes, and then filled in the center with a mixture of cheese (fresh or aged, most commonly, specialized khachapuri cheese), and sometimes eggs or other ingredients.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goldstein|first=Darra|title=The Georgian feast: the vibrant culture and savory food of the Republic of Georgia|publisher=University of California Press|pages=136–139|isbn=0-520-21929-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3PM_FnWgPBAC|year=1999}}</ref>

It is popular in Georgia, both in restaurants and as street food. As a Georgian staple food, the price of making khachapuri is used as a measure of inflation in different Georgian cities by the "khachapuri index", developed by the International School of Economics at [[Tbilisi State University]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.investor.ge/issues/2010_2/02.htm |title=Tracking monetary policy one big mac – and one khachapuri – at a time |last=Svensson |first=Therese |date=April–May 2010 |work=Investor.ge |publisher=American Chamber of Commerce |access-date=29 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007010149/http://www.investor.ge/issues/2010_2/02.htm |archive-date= 7 October 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iset-pi.ge/index.php?article_id=715 |title=Khachapuri Index Project|publisher=International School of Economics at Tbilisi State University|access-date=29 April 2010}}</ref> It is Georgia's [[national dish]], included in the list of the [[intangible cultural heritage of Georgia]].<ref>Jones, A.

The khachapuri is served hot from the oven, otherwise it loses the taste of its unique cheese mixture and becomes bitter.

== Etymology ==
ხაჭო is borrowed from Abkhazian ''а-хаҷа'',<ref>https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=ხაჭოჲ&oldid=84861071#Etymology</ref> and პური is of Ancient Greek origin.<ref>https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=პური&oldid=85067902#Etymology</ref>

== History ==
Specialists are divided regarding the chronology of khachapuri. According to Darra Goldstein, who wrote the book ''The Georgian Feast'' about the dish, khachapuri probably dates back to the 12th century when Georgia experienced a [[Georgian Golden Age|period of renaissance]], but its specific root remains unclear.<ref>{{cite web |date=2018-04-27 |title=Georgian cheese boat Adjaruli Khachapuri - New York Essential Dish |url=https://georgianjournal.ge/georgian-cuisine/34443-georgian-cheese-boat-adjaruli-khachapuri-new-york-essential-dish.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221128024206/https://georgianjournal.ge/georgian-cuisine/34443-georgian-cheese-boat-adjaruli-khachapuri-new-york-essential-dish.html |archive-date=2022-11-28 |access-date=2023-09-03 |website=Georgian Journal}}</ref> Dali Tsatava, former professor at the Georgian Culinary Academy, suggested that khachapuri could be a "cousin of the [[pizza]]" as the concept of the dish might have been brought by Roman soldiers who crossed Europe, well before the addition of tomatoes in the 16th century.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Eva |date=2019-04-05 |title=Khachapuri, Georgian cheese bread |url=https://bake-street.com/en/khachapuri-georgian-cheese-bread/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230324002404/https://bake-street.com/en/khachapuri-georgian-cheese-bread/ |archive-date=2023-03-24 |access-date=2023-02-22 |website=Bake-Street}}</ref>

[[File:Good tasty delicious dish Adjara 2021.jpg|thumb|Adjarian khachapuri]]
There are several distinctive types of khachapuri from different regions of Georgia:<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.georgia-tours.eu/complete-guide-to-khachapuri/ |title = Complete guide to Khachapuri 11 varieties you didn’t know |date = 2025-10-06}}</ref>
* [[Imereti]]an (Imeruli) khachapuri is the most popular form, made with a yeast dough filled with white Imeretian salted cheese.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://georgiaabout.com/2012/07/27/about-food-imeruli-imeretian-khachapuri/ |title = About Food – Imeruli (Imeretian Khachapuri)|date = 2012-07-27}}</ref>
* [[Adjara|Adjarian]] (Acharuli/Adjaruli), named for Adjara, a region of Georgia on the Black Sea, is a boat-shaped khachapuri, with cheese, butter, and an egg yolk in the middle. Traditionally, tangy imeruli and [[sulguni]] cheeses are used.
* [[Mingrelia|Megrelian]] khachapuri (Megruli) is similar to Imeretian, but has more cheese added on top.
* Achma, from [[Abkhazia]], has multiple layers and resembles a sauceless [[lasagna]].
* [[Guria]]n (Guruli) khachapuri has chopped boiled eggs inside and looks like a crescent-shaped [[calzone]]. Gurians make them for Christmas and call them simply "Christmas pie." In the rest of Georgia, it is called "Gurian pie."
* [[Ossetia]]n (Osuri) khachapuri has potato and cheese as its filling. It is commonly called khabizgini.
* [[Svaneti|Svanuri]] lemzira
* [[Racha|Rachuli]] khachapuri
* [[Samtskhe–Javakheti]]an penovani khachapuri is made with cheese-filled puff pastry dough, resulting in a flaky variety of the pie.
