A '''sucking-pig''' ([[British English|BrE]])<ref name=oed>{{cite OED|sucking-pig}}</ref> or '''suckling pig''' ([[American English|AmE]])<ref>[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/suckling%20pig "Suckling pig"],  ''Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary'', Merriam-Webster. Retrieved 9 August 2025</ref> is a [[Piglet (animal)|piglet]] fed on its [[pig milk|mother's milk]] (i.e., a piglet which is still being "[[suckled]]"). In culinary contexts, a sucking-pig is [[Animal slaughter|slaughtered]] before the end of its second month. Celebrated since [[Ancient Greek cuisine|Greek]] and [[Ancient Roman cuisine|Roman]] times, it is traditionally cooked whole, usually roasted, in various cuisines, and is often prepared for special occasions and gatherings. 

A variation is popular in Spain and Portugal and their former empires under the name '''{{lang|es|lechón}}''' (Spanish) or '''{{lang|pt|leitão}}''' (Portuguese), but the dish is common to many countries in Europe, the Americas and east Asia. Its popularity in Britain and the US has declined since the 19th century.

==Definition and preparation==
According to ''[[Larousse Gastronomique]]'', a piglet – in French a {{lang|fr|porcelet}} – is defined as a sucking-pig if it is below the age of two months.<ref>Montagné, p. 757</ref> ''The Oxford Dictionary of Food and Nutrition'' defines the age as four to five weeks.<ref>{{cite book | title=A Dictionary of Food and Nutrition | chapter=Sucking pig | date=2014 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-175239-1 | url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191752391.001.0001/acref-9780191752391-e-5226 }}</ref> It may weigh as little as three or four kilos (6.6 – 8.8 lbs).<ref name=r518>Riley, p. 518</ref> [[Mrs Beeton]] recommended putting the slaughtered piglet into cold water briefly and then immersing it in boiling water, before pulling off the hair and removing the entrails.<ref name=ib/> In his 1907 ''Guide to Modern Cookery'', [[Auguste Escoffier]] wrote, "Stuffed or not stuffed, sucking pigs are always roasted whole, and the essential point of the procedure is that they should be just done when their skin is crisp and golden".<ref>Escoffier, p. 459</ref>

==History==
[[File:Dictionary-porcellus-etc.png|16th-century multilingual dictionary giving the words for "sucking-pig" in Latin, Greek, German, French, Italian, Spanish and English|alt=Per caption|thumb]]

Many recipes for sucking-pig survive from ancient times. [[Andrew Dalby]] in his ''Siren Feasts: A History of Food and Gastronomy in Greece'' (1996) draws attention to the precise and differentiated Greek vocabulary for categorising pigs of varying ages and sizes, and observes that "sucking-pigs, {{lang|el|galathenoi}}, were a particular delicacy".<ref>Dalby, p. 59</ref> Ancient [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] and [[Ancient Roman cuisine|Roman]] cuisine valued the dish: [[Alan Davidson (food writer)|Alan Davidson]] comments, "the Romans certainly liked sucking pig".<ref>Davidson, p. 623</ref> In her 1985 ''Food and Cooking in Roman Britain'', [[Jane Renfrew]] writes, "Sucking pig was roasted in the oven and then served with a thickened sauce flavoured with pepper, [[lovage]], [[caraway]], [[celery seed]], [[asafoetida]] root, [[rue]], [[liquamen]], wine [[must]] and olive oil".<ref>Renfrew, p. 18</ref> [[Apicius]]'s fifth-century cookery book {{lang|la|De re coquinaria}} (About Cooking) contains several recipes for sucking-pig, including {{lang|la|porcellum assum tractomelinum}} (stuffed with pastry and honey) and {{lang|la|porcellum farsilem duobus generis}} (stuffed in two ways – one stuffing being a mixture of pepper, lovage, oregano, celery seed, [[cumin]], [[fennel]] seed and [[rosemary]], and the other containing [[laser root]],  cooked brains, raw eggs and boiled [[spelt]]).<ref>Apicius, pp, 70–71</ref> The sucking-pig appears in early texts such as the sixth-century [[Salic law]].{{refn|As an example of a law governing the punishment for theft, Title 2, article 1, is, in Latin, {{lang|la-x-medieval|Si quis porcellum lactantem furaverit, et ei fuerit adprobatum (malb. chrane calcium hoc est) CXX dinarios qui faciunt solidos III culpabilis iudicetur}}. "If someone has stolen a suckling pig and this is proven against him, the guilty party will be sentenced to 120 [[Denarius|denarii]] which adds up to three [[Solidus (coin)|solidi]] (Latin coins)." The words {{lang|frk|chrane calcium}} are written in Frankish; {{lang|frk|calcium}} (or {{lang|frk|galza}} in other manuscripts) is the [[Gloss (annotation)#In linguistics|gloss]] for "suckling pig"; {{lang|la-x-medieval|porcellum lactantem}}.<ref>Gilissen and Gorlé, p. 166</ref>|group=n}}

The first recorded use of the term in English dates from 1553: "Yonge suckynge pygges, {{lang|lat|porci delici}}".<ref name=lm>Mason, p. 761</ref> ''[[The Oxford Companion to Food]]'' (OCF) comments, "Sucking pigs are sometimes referred to as suckling pigs; this is incorrect, since it is the mothers who suckle and the young who suck".<ref name=lm/>{{refn|John Ayto in his ''Diner's Dictionary'' (2012) argues that the use of "suckling" to mean sucking milk from the teat rather than giving it goes back to the seventeenth century, though he provides no evidence for this and sticks to the traditional English "sucking pig" in his book.<ref>Ayto, pp. 287 and 356</ref>|group=n}} In the sixteenth century a common alternative term was "roasting pigs".<ref name=oed/> Sucking-pigs were widely used in medieval cookery, and when it became more usual for pigs to be farmed than hunted in forests a larger proportion would be killed and sold as sucking-pigs.<ref name=lm/> In the 18th century [[Hannah Glasse]] and in the 19th century Mrs Beeton published recipes for them, "always the most favoured way of cooking them";<ref name=lm/> Mrs Beeton stipulates, "A sucking-pig, to be eaten in perfection, should not be more than three weeks old, and should be dressed the same day that it is killed".<ref name=ib>Beeton, p. 397</ref> The OCF adds, "in recent times sucking-pig has become less and less usual in England and the USA".<ref name=lm/>
