The most common variety is '''''pat-bingsu''''' ({{Langx|ko|팥빙수|translation=red bean frozen water}}), topped with [[adzuki bean|sweet red beans]]. The main ingredient of ''bingsu'' was natural ice in the past, but later, artificial ice was produced, and high-quality sweeteners were developed. Many modern bingsu varieties use frozen milk rather than water-based ice. Historically, the ice-cutting machine was a simple tool in the shape of a plane, but now, most shaved ice is created by electric ice shavers.

== History ==
Bingsu has similar origins to [[sorbet]], with fruit- and milk-flavored ice-based confectionary documented as far back as 400 BCE.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Marks|first=Gil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gFK_yx7Ps7cC&q=sorbet+originated+in+persia&pg=PT593|title=Encyclopedia of Jewish Food|date=November 17, 2010|publisher=HMH|isbn=978-0-544-18631-6|language=en|access-date=March 21, 2023|archive-date=April 3, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230403234108/https://books.google.com/books?id=gFK_yx7Ps7cC&q=sorbet+originated+in+persia&pg=PT593|url-status=live}}</ref> The earliest known documentation of ice-based desserts within Korea existed during the [[Joseon]] period (1392–1897) which employed the use of crushed ice with various fruits, and were distributed from the ancient Korean ice storage called ''[[Gyeongju Seokbinggo]]'' ({{langx|ko|석빙고}}).<ref name="History 1">{{cite news |last=Dang |first=Tae Keuk |url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20100812000473 |title=Snowy delights and variations on bingsu |publisher=[[Herald Corporation]] |date=September 13, 2010 |access-date=January 6, 2014 |archive-date=May 16, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210516031618/http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20100812000473 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Doopedia">{{cite web |url=http://www.doopedia.co.kr/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view&MAS_IDX=101013000794579 |script-title=ko:팥빙수[氷水] |publisher=Doosan Corporation |work=[[Doopedia]] |access-date=January 6, 2014 |language=ko |trans-title=Patbingsu |archive-date=September 23, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923223845/http://www.doopedia.co.kr/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view&MAS_IDX=101013000794579 |url-status=live }}</ref>

After the [[Korean War]], with the introduction of [[condensed milk]], [[syrup]], and [[chocolate]] from the [[United States]], together with the [[mass migration]] of [[Korean Americans|Korean immigrants]] who brought their [[Korean cuisine|culinary cuisine]] to the [[United States|US]], Korean bingsu began to be more diverse. Western ingredients brought into the country after the [[Korean War]], along with the influence of [[Korean American]] [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]] have brought further variation to the ingredients used in the dish, with foods such as [[breakfast cereal|cereal]], [[ice cream]], and [[whipped cream]] being added to bingsu.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Seoul Eats: The Origin of Patbingsu|url=https://www.seouleats.com/2011/05/origin-of-patbingsu.html|access-date=August 9, 2020|website=Seoul Eats|archive-date=August 4, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804114535/https://www.seouleats.com/2011/05/origin-of-patbingsu.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Get ready for patbingsu: Red beans over shaved ice|url=http://www.jejuweekly.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=1888|access-date=January 2, 2022|website=The Jeju Weekly|archive-date=January 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106034544/http://www.jejuweekly.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=1888|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The food began as ice shavings with red beans (known as ''pat'', {{lang|ko|팥}}). Many varieties of ''patbingsu'' exist in contemporary culture.

There are a variety of ''bingsu'' types and flavors. Some popular flavors are [[green tea]], [[coffee]], and [[yogurt]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Lee |first=Ji-yoon |url=http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/Culture/view?articleId=72999 |title=Korea's cold summer taste - naengmyeon and patbingsu |publisher=[[Korean Culture and Information Service]] |work=[[Korea.net]] |date=July 7, 2008 |access-date=January 6, 2013 |archive-date=January 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140106163239/http://www.korea.net/NewsFocus/Culture/view?articleId=72999 |url-status=bot: unknown }}</ref><ref name="VisitKorea">{{cite web |url=http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_6.jsp?cid=1692586 |title=Bingsu, an unbeatable summer treat! |publisher=[[Korea Tourism Organization]] |access-date=January 6, 2014 |archive-date=January 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106065133/http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_6.jsp?cid=1692586 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In addition to the existing ''patbingsu'', several Korean franchises have made shaved ice from various ingredients such as [[Injeolmi]], melon, coffee, and green tea. Now, bingsu can be found at almost every dessert shop in Korea.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Linda|date=October 12, 2019|title=15 of the Best Bingsu in Seoul|url=https://lindagoeseast.com/2019/10/12/15-of-the-best-bingsu-in-seoul/|access-date=June 11, 2021|website=Linda Goes East|language=en-US|archive-date=July 25, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210725055642/https://lindagoeseast.com/2019/10/12/15-of-the-best-bingsu-in-seoul|url-status=live}}</ref>
