{{nihongo|'''Sushi'''|すし, 寿司, 鮨, 鮓||extra={{IPA|ja|sɯɕiꜜ|pron}} {{IPA|ja|sɯꜜɕi||TomJ-Sushi.ogg|label=or}}}} is a traditional Japanese dish made with {{nihongo|vinegared [[rice]]|鮨飯|sushi-meshi}}, typically seasoned with [[sugar]] and [[salt]], and combined with a variety of {{nihongo|ingredients|ねた|neta}}, such as [[seafood]], [[vegetables]], or [[meat]]; raw seafood is the most common, although some may be cooked. While sushi has numerous styles and presentations, the current defining component is the vinegared rice, also known as {{nihongo||しゃり|shari}}, or {{nihongo||酢飯|sumeshi}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.finecooking.com/article/sushi|title=Sushi – How-To|date=1998-05-01|website=FineCooking|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-04|archive-date=2019-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191104201050/https://www.finecooking.com/article/sushi|url-status=live}}</ref>

The modern form of sushi is believed to have been created by [[Hanaya Yohei]], who invented ''nigiri-zushi'', the most commonly recognized type today, in which seafood is placed on hand-pressed, vinegared rice. This innovation occurred around 1824 in the [[Edo period]] (1603–1867). It was the fast food of the ''[[chōnin]]'' class in the Edo period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://toyokeizai.net/articles/-/70530|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909042355/https://toyokeizai.net/articles/-/70530|title=The Mysteries of Sushi – Part 2: Fast Food|publisher=[[Toyo Keizai]]|date=23 May 2015|archive-date=9 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nippon.com/en/japan-topics/g00962/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210118223017/https://www.nippon.com/en/japan-topics/g00962/|title=When Sushi Became a New Fast Food in Edo|publisher=Nippon.com|date=22 December 2020|archive-date=18 January 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nihombashi-tokyo.com/history/326.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211228234530/https://nihombashi-tokyo.com/history/326.html|title=Sushi|publisher=Nihonbashi|archive-date=28 December 2021}}</ref>

Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain [[white rice]], although it can also be prepared with [[brown rice]] or short-grain rice. It is commonly prepared with seafood, such as [[Squid as food|squid]], [[Eel as food|eel]], [[Japanese amberjack|yellowtail]], [[Salmon as food|salmon]], [[Tuna as food|tuna]], or [[Crab stick|imitation crab meat]] (''surimi''). Certain types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with {{nihongo|[[gari (ginger)|pickled ginger]]||gari}}, [[wasabi]], and [[soy sauce]]. [[Daikon radish]] or {{nihongo|[[pickled daikon]]||takuan}} are popular garnishes for the dish.

Sushi is sometimes confused with [[sashimi]], a dish that consists of thinly sliced raw [[fish]] or occasionally meat, without sushi rice.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.diffen.com/difference/Sashimi_vs_Sushi|title=Sashimi vs Sushi – Difference and Comparison {{!}} Diffen|website=www.diffen.com|language=en|access-date=2019-06-05|archive-date=2019-06-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190605054232/https://www.diffen.com/difference/Sashimi_vs_Sushi|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== ''Narezushi'' ===
[[File:Barack Obama and Shinzo Abe at Sukyabashi Jiro April 2014.jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] and Prime Minister [[Shinzo Abe]] at [[Sukiyabashi Jiro]]]]
A dish known as {{nihongo3||馴れ寿司, 熟寿司|narezushi}}, "matured fish", stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time, has been cited as one of the early influences for the Japanese practice of applying rice on raw fish. The fish was fermented with [[rice vinegar]], salt, and rice, after which the rice was discarded.<ref name="worldcat1993">{{Cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Cherl-Ho|title=Fish fermentation technology|last2=Steinkraus|first2=Keith H|last3=Reilly|first3=P.J.

Fermented fish using rice, such as {{transliteration|ja|narezushi}}, originated in [[Southeast Asia]], where it was made to preserve [[freshwater fish]], possibly in the [[Mekong River]] basin, which is now [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]], and in the [[Irrawaddy River]] basin, which is now [[Myanmar]].<ref name="jst140223" /> The first mention of a {{transliteration|ja|narezushi}}-like food is in a Chinese dictionary thought to be from the fourth century, in this instance referring to salted fish that had been placed in cooked or steamed rice, which caused it to undergo a fermentation process via [[lactic acid]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mouritsen |first=O.

The [[lacto-fermentation]] of the rice prevents the fish from spoiling. When wet-field rice cultivation was introduced during the [[Yayoi period]], lakes and rivers would flood during the rainy season and fish would get caught in the rice paddy fields. Pickling was a way to preserve the excess fish and guarantee food for the following months, and {{transliteration|ja|narezushi}} became an important source of protein for Japanese consumers. The term ''sushi'' literally means "sour-tasting", as the overall dish has a sour and [[umami]] or savory taste. The term comes from an [[Japanese adjectives#Archaic forms|antiquated]] {{lang|ja|し}} {{transliteration|ja|shi}} terminal-form conjugation, no longer used in other contexts, of the [[Japanese adjectives|adjectival verb]] {{nihongo3|"to be sour"|酸い|sui}},<ref>1988, 国語大辞典（新装版） (Kokugo Dai Jiten, Revised Edition) (in Japanese), Tōkyō: Shogakukan</ref> resulting in the term {{nihongo||酸し|sushi}}.<ref>{{cite journal | author1 = Kouji Itou | author2 = Shinsuke Kobayashi | author3 = Tooru Ooizumi | author4 = Yoshiaki Akahane | year = 2006 | title = Changes of proximate composition and extractive components in narezushi, a fermented mackerel product, during processing | journal = Fisheries Science | volume = 72 | issue = 6 | pages = 1269–1276 | doi = 10.1111/j.1444-2906.2006.01285.x| bibcode = 2006FisSc..72.1269I | s2cid = 24004124 |issn=0919-9268 | doi-access = free }}</ref> {{transliteration|ja|Narezushi}} still exists as a regional specialty, notably as {{transliteration|ja|funa-zushi}} from [[Shiga Prefecture]].<ref name="tsukiji">{{cite book |last1=Bestor |first1=Theodore C. |author-link = Theodore C.

In the {{nihongo|[[Yōrō Code]]|養老律令|Yōrō-ritsuryō}} of 718, the characters for "鮨" and "鮓" are written as a tribute to the Japanese imperial court, and although there are various theories as to what exactly this food was, it is possible that it referred to {{transliteration|ja|narezushi}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://style.nikkei.com/article/DGXMZO30379530R10C18A5000000?page=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201028122209/https://style.nikkei.com/article/DGXMZO30379530R10C18A5000000?page=2|script-title=ja:握りずし 始まりは江戸っ子のホットドッグスタンド|language=ja|publisher=[[Nikkei, Inc.]]|date=9 June 2018|archive-date=28 October 2020|access-date=4 April 2023}}</ref>

=== ''Namanare'' ===
Until the early 19th century, sushi slowly changed with Japanese cuisine. The Japanese started eating three meals a day, rice was boiled instead of steamed, and of large importance was the development of rice vinegar.<ref name="Moritzen">{{cite book|last=Mpritzen|first=Ole G.|title=Sushi: Food for the Eye, the Body and the Soul|year=2009|publisher=Springer Science-Business Media|page=15}}</ref>

During the Muromachi period (1336–1573), the Japanese invented a style of sushi called {{transliteration|ja|namanare}} or '''{{transliteration|ja|namanari}}''' ({{lang|ja|生成、なまなれ、なまなり}}), which means "partially fermented". The fermentation period of {{transliteration|ja|namanare}} was shorter than that of the earlier {{transliteration|ja|narezushi}}, and the rice used for fermentation was also eaten with the fish. In other words, with the invention of {{transliteration|ja|namanare}}, sushi changed from a preserved fish food to a food where fish and rice are eaten together. After the appearance of {{transliteration|ja|namanare}}, [[sake]] and sake lees were used to shorten fermentation, and vinegar was used in the Edo period.<ref name="jst140223">{{cite web|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jisdh/31/4/31_201/_pdf/-char/ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230214220815/https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jisdh/31/4/31_201/_pdf/-char/ja|title=The evolution of sushi and the power of vinegar|pages=201, 202|author=Hirofumi Akano|publisher=[[Japan Science and Technology Agency]]|archive-date=14 February 2023|access-date=4 April 2023}}</ref>

=== ''Hayazushi'' ===
[[File:Hiroshige Bowl of Sushi.jpg|thumb|right|''Bowl of Sushi'' by [[Hiroshige]] (1797–1858). ''[[#Makizushi|Makizushi]]'' with rice rolled in ''[[tamagoyaki]]'' (front) and ''[[#Nigirizushi|nigirizushi]]'' with shrimp (back).]]

During the Edo period (1603–1867), a third type of sushi, {{nihongo3|"fast sushi"|早寿司、早ずし|haya-zushi}}, was developed. {{transliteration|ja|Haya-zushi}} differed from earlier sushi in that instead of lactic fermentation of rice, vinegar, a fermented food, was mixed with rice to give it a sour taste so that it could be eaten at the same time as the fish. Previously, sushi had evolved with a focus on shortening the fermentation period, but with the invention of {{transliteration|ja|haya-zushi}}, which is simply mixed with vinegar, the fermentation process was eliminated and sushi became a fast food. Many types of sushi known in the world today, such as {{nihongo3|"scattered sushi"|散らし寿司|[[#Chirashizushi|chirashizushi]]}}, {{nihongo3|"[[Inari Ōkami|Inari]] sushi"|稲荷寿司|[[#Inarizushi|inarizushi]]}}, {{nihongo3|"rolled sushi"|巻寿司|[[#Makizushi|makizushi]]}}, and {{nihongo3|"hand-pressed sushi"|握り寿司|[[#Nigirizushi|nigirizushi]]}}, were invented during this period, and they are a type of {{transliteration|ja|haya-zushi}}. Each region utilizes local flavors to produce a variety of sushi that has been passed down for many generations. A 1689 cookbook describes {{transliteration|ja|haya-zushi}}, and a 1728 cookbook describes pouring vinegar over {{nihongo3|"box sushi"|箱ずし|[[#Oshizushi|hako-zushi]]}} (square sushi made by filling a wooden frame with rice).<ref name="jst140223"/>

Today's style of {{nihongo3|"hand-pressed sushi"|握り寿司|nigirizushi}}, consisting of an oblong mound of rice with a slice of fish draped over it, became popular in [[Edo]] (contemporary Tokyo) in the 1820s or 1830s. One common story of the origin of {{transliteration|ja|nigirizushi}} is of the chef Hanaya Yohei (1799–1858), who invented or perfected the technique in 1824 at his shop in [[Ryōgoku]].<ref name="tsukiji"/> The {{transliteration|ja|nigirizushi}} of this period was somewhat different from modern {{transliteration|ja|nigirizushi}}. The sushi rice of this period was about three times the size of today's {{transliteration|ja|nigirizushi}}. The amount of vinegar used was half that of today's sushi, and the type of vinegar developed during this period, called {{nihongo3|"red vinegar"|赤酢|aka-su}}, was made by fermenting sake lees. They also used slightly more salt than in modern times instead of sugar. Seafood served over rice was prepared in a variety of ways. This red vinegar was developed by Nakano Matazaemon (中野 又佐衛門), who is the founder of [[Mizkan]], a company that still develops and sells vinegar and other seasonings today.<ref name="jst140223"/>

The dish was originally termed {{transliteration|ja|Edomae zushi}} as it used freshly caught fish from the {{transliteration|ja|Edo-mae}} (Edo or [[Tokyo Bay]]); the term {{transliteration|ja|Edomae nigirizushi}} is still used today as a by-word for quality sushi, regardless of its ingredients' origins.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Connoisseur's Guide to Sushi |first=Dave |last=Lowry |publisher=ReadHowYouWant.com |year=2010 |isbn=978-1458764140 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ut9nOwsFegC&q=Edomae&pg=PR17 |page=xvii |quote=A nugget of rice was seasoned with vinegar and topped by a sliver of seafood fresh from the bay that was only a few blocks away.

Nigiri-zushi is also known as Edomae-zushi. Edomae refers to the small bay in Edo in front of the old palace that stood on the same site as the present-day imperial precinct in Tokyo. Fresh fish and shellfish caught in the bay were used locally to make sushi, known as Edomae-zushi. It has, however, been many years since these waters have been a source of seafood. Now the expression Edomae-zushi is employed as a synonym for high-quality nigiri-zushi. |page=17 |access-date=2020-11-01 |archive-date=2021-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210617105637/https://books.google.com/books?id=RJxuV-0eT4UC&q=%22edomae%22&pg=PA17 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1958, Yoshiaki Shiraishi opened the first {{nihongo|[[conveyor belt sushi]] restaurant|回転寿司|kaiten-zushi}} named "[[Genroku culture|Genroku]] Zushi" in [[Higashi-Osaka]].

When Genroku Sushi opened a restaurant at the [[Expo '70|Japan World Exposition, Osaka, 1970]], it won an award at the expo, and conveyor belt sushi restaurants became known throughout Japan. In 1973, an automatic tea dispenser was developed, which is now used in conveyor belt sushi restaurants today. When the patent for conveyor belt sushi restaurants expired, a chain of conveyor belt sushi restaurants was established, spreading conveyor belt sushi throughout [[Japan]] and further popularizing and lowering the price of sushi. By 2021, the conveyor belt sushi market had grown to 700 billion yen and spread outside Japan.<ref name="magnier"/><ref name="walker14224"/><ref name="genroku11223"/>

{{Cookbook|Inarizushi}}

{{nihongo|''Inarizushi''|稲荷寿司}} is a pouch of [[Abura-age|fried tofu]] typically filled with sushi rice alone. According to Shinto lore, {{transliteration|ja|inarizushi}} is named after the god [[Inari Ōkami|Inari]]. Foxes, messengers of Inari, are believed to have a fondness for fried [[tofu]] and in some regions an Inari-zushi roll has pointed corners that resemble fox ears, thus reinforcing the association.<ref>[[Karen Ann Smyers|Smyers, Karen Ann]]. ''The Fox and the Jewel: Shared and Private Meanings in Contemporary Japanese Inari Worship'' (1999), Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, p. 96.</ref> The shape of Inarizushi varies by region.

{{nihongo3|"rolled sushi"|巻き寿司|Makizushi}}, {{nihongo3|"[[nori]] roll"|海苔巻き|[[norimaki]]|extra=used generically for other dishes as well}} or {{nihongo3|"variety of rolls"|巻物|makimono}} is a cylindrical piece formed with the help of a mat known as a {{nihongo||巻き簾|[[makisu]]}}. {{transliteration|ja|Makizushi}} is generally wrapped in nori (seaweed) but is occasionally wrapped in a thin [[omelette]], soy paper, [[cucumber]], or {{transliteration|ja|[[shiso]]}} (perilla) leaves. {{transliteration|ja|Makizushi}} is often cut into six or eight pieces, constituting a single roll order. Short-grain white rice is usually used, although short-grain brown rice, like [[olive oil]] on nori, is now becoming more widespread among the health-conscious. Rarely, sweet rice is mixed in {{transliteration|ja|makizushi}} rice.

Nowadays, the rice in {{transliteration|ja|makizushi}} can be many kinds of [[black rice]], boiled rice, and cereals. Besides the common ingredients listed above, some varieties may include cheese, spicy cooked squid, {{transliteration|ja|[[yakiniku]]}}, {{transliteration|ja|[[kamaboko]]}}, [[lunch meat]], sausage, bacon or [[Spicy tuna roll|spicy tuna]]. The nori may be brushed with [[sesame oil]] or sprinkled with [[Sesame|sesame seeds]]. In a variation, sliced pieces of {{transliteration|ja|makizushi}} may be lightly fried with [[Eggs as food|egg]] coating.

Below are some common types of {{transliteration|ja|makizushi}}, but many other kinds exist.

{{nihongo3|"hand-pressed sushi"|握り寿司|Nigirizushi}} consists of an oblong mound of sushi rice that a chef typically presses between the palms of the hands to form an oval-shaped ball and a topping (the {{transliteration|ja|neta}}) draped over the ball. It is usually served with a bit of wasabi; toppings are typically fish such as salmon, tuna, or other seafood. Certain toppings are typically bound to the rice with a thin strip of nori, most commonly octopus ({{transliteration|ja|tako}}), freshwater eel ({{transliteration|ja|unagi}}), sea eel ({{transliteration|ja|[[anago]]}}), squid ({{transliteration|ja|ika}}), and sweet egg ({{transliteration|ja|tamago}}).<!--Is this really disputable enough to require a cite?-->

The increasing popularity of sushi worldwide has resulted in variations typically found in the [[Western world]] but rarely in Japan.

One widespread form of sushi created to suit the Western palate is the [[California roll]], a {{transliteration|ja|[[#Makizushi|norimaki]]}} which presently almost always uses [[Crab stick|imitation crab]] (the original recipe calls for real cooked crab), along with avocado and cucumber.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hsin-I Feng |first=Cindy |date=February 29, 2012 |title=The Tale of Sushi: History and Regulations |url=https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-4337.2011.00180.x |journal=Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety |language=en |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=205–220 |doi=10.1111/j.1541-4337.2011.00180.x |issn=1541-4337|url-access=subscription }}</ref> A wide variety of popular rolls ({{transliteration|ja|norimaki}} and {{transliteration|ja|[[#Uramaki|uramaki]]}}) have evolved since.

Japanese-born chef [[Hidekazu Tojo]], a resident of Vancouver, British Columbia since 1971 is also credited,<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" /> claiming he created the California roll at his restaurant in the late 1970s.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2012-10-23 |title=Meet the man behind the California roll |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/food-and-wine/food-trends/meet-the-man-behind-the-california-roll/article4631256/ |access-date=2024-12-29 |work=The Globe and Mail |language=en-CA}}</ref> Tojo insists he is the innovator of the "inside-out" sushi, and it got the name "California roll" because its contents of crab and avocado were abbreviated to C.A., which is the abbreviation for the state of [[California]]. Because of this coincidence, Tojo was set on the name California Roll. According to Tojo, he single-handedly created the California roll at his Vancouver, British Columbia restaurant, including all the modern ingredients of cucumber, cooked crab, and avocado.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The California Roll Was Invented in Canada {{!}} Ghostarchive |url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/3SwX8ANq7Ls |access-date=2024-12-29 |website=ghostarchive.org}}</ref> In 2016 the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Japan)|Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries]] named Tojo a [[goodwill ambassador]] for Japanese cuisine.<ref>{{Cite web |date=Jun 10, 2016 |title=Vancouver chef Tojo honoured by Japanese government |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/tojo-1.3628563 |website=CBC.ca |publisher=The Canadian Press}}</ref>

The common theme in origin stories is that surrounding the roll in rice made it more appealing to western consumers who had never eaten traditional sushi. This innovation led to the eventual creation of countless rolls across North America and the world.{{cn|date=December 2024}}

For example, the "Norway roll" is another variant of {{transliteration|ja|uramakizushi}} filled with {{transliteration|ja|tamago}} (omelette), imitation crab and cucumber, rolled with {{transliteration|ja|shiso}} leaf and {{transliteration|ja|nori}}, topped with slices of Norwegian salmon, garnished with lemon and mayonnaise.<ref>{{cite web |title = Norway Roll of Umegaoka Sushi No Midori Sohonten Shibuya |url = https://www.tripadvisor.com/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g1066456-d1678469-i55468107-Umegaoka_Sushi_No_Midori_Sohonten_Shibuya-Shibuya_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture.html |access-date = 2016-05-09 |archive-date = 2016-08-06 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160806034854/https://www.tripadvisor.com/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g1066456-d1678469-i55468107-Umegaoka_Sushi_No_Midori_Sohonten_Shibuya-Shibuya_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture.html |url-status = live }}</ref>

Although most Western sushi creations are rare in Japan, a notable exception to this is the use of salmon. The Japanese have eaten salmon since prehistory; however, caught salmon in nature often contains [[Parasitism|parasites]] and must be cooked or cured for its lean meat to be edible. On the other side of the world, in the 1960s and 1970s, Norwegian entrepreneurs started experimenting with [[aquaculture]] farming. The big breakthrough was when they figured out how to raise salmon in net pens in the sea. Being farm-raised, the [[Atlantic salmon]] reportedly showed advantages over the [[Oncorhynchus|Pacific salmon]], such as no parasites, easy animal capture, and higher fat content. With government subsidies and improved techniques, they were so successful in raising fatty and parasite-free salmon they ended up with a surplus. Norway has a small population and limited market; therefore, they looked to other countries to export their salmon. The first Norwegian salmon was imported into Japan in 1980, accepted conventionally, for grilling, not for sushi. Salmon had already been consumed in North America as an ingredient in sushi as early as the 1970s.<ref>{{cite news|title=Episode 651: The Salmon Taboo|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/09/16/440951873/episode-651-the-salmon-taboo|access-date=2021-04-17|website=NPR.org|language=en|archive-date=2021-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210417221940/https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/09/16/440951873/episode-651-the-salmon-taboo|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=How The Desperate Norwegian Salmon Industry Created A Sushi Staple|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/09/18/441530790/how-the-desperate-norwegian-salmon-industry-created-a-sushi-staple|access-date=2021-04-17|website=NPR.org|language=en|archive-date=2019-04-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424211018/https://www.npr.org/2015/09/18/441530790/how-the-desperate-norwegian-salmon-industry-created-a-sushi-staple|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Matsui|first=Akira|date=2005-06-01|title=Salmon Exploitation in Jomon Archaeology from a Wetlands Point of View|url=https://doi.org/10.1179/jwa.2005.5.1.49|journal=Journal of Wetland Archaeology|volume=5|issue=1|pages=49–63|doi=10.1179/jwa.2005.5.1.49|bibcode=2005JWetA...5...49M |s2cid=140720425|issn=1473-2971|access-date=2021-04-17|archive-date=2021-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210617105641/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/jwa.2005.5.1.49|url-status=live|url-access=subscription}}</ref> Salmon sushi did not become widely accepted in Japan until a successful marketing partnership in the late 1980s between [[Bjørn E.

===''Uramaki''===
{{redirect|Uramaki|the song|Uramaki (song)}}
[[File:Western Sushi.jpg|thumb|right|{{transliteration|ja|Uramakizushi}} rolls]]
{{nihongo3|"inside-out roll"|裏巻|Uramaki}} is a medium-sized cylindrical style of sushi with two or more fillings and was developed as a result of the creation of the California roll, as a method originally meant to hide the nori. {{transliteration|ja|Uramaki}} differs from other {{transliteration|ja|makimono}} because the rice is on the outside and the nori inside. The filling is surrounded by nori, then a layer of rice, and optionally an outer coating of some other ingredients such as roe or toasted sesame seeds. It can be made with different fillings, such as tuna, [[crab meat]], avocado, mayonnaise, cucumber, or carrots.

Examples of variations include the [[rainbow roll]] (an inside-out topped with thinly sliced {{transliteration|ja|maguro, hamachi, ebi, sake}} and avocado) and the caterpillar roll (an inside-out topped with thinly sliced avocado). Also commonly found is the "rock and roll" (an inside-out roll with barbecued freshwater eel and avocado with toasted sesame seeds on the outside).

In Japan, {{transliteration|ja|uramaki}} is an uncommon type of {{transliteration|ja|makimono}}; because sushi is traditionally eaten by hand in Japan, the outer layer of rice can be quite difficult to handle with fingers.<ref name="sushimasters">{{cite web |url=http://www.calrice.org/Cuisine/History+of+Sushi/Sushi+Pioneers.htm |title=Sushi Pioneers |work=SushiMasters |access-date=2008-07-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411172107/http://www.calrice.org/Cuisine/History+of+Sushi/Sushi+Pioneers.htm |archive-date=2013-04-11 }}</ref>

In Brazil {{transliteration|ja|uramaki}} and other sushi pieces commonly include cream cheese in their recipe. Although unheard of in Japanese sushi, this is the most common sushi ingredient used in Brazil. {{transliteration|ja|Temaki}} also often contains a large amount of cream cheese and is extremely popular in restaurants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.otempo.com.br/mobile/gastro/tradicao-x-modernidade-na-comida-japonesa-1.1103456?amp|title=Tradição X modernidade na comida japonesa &#124; O TEMPO|website=www.otempo.com.br|access-date=2021-06-17|archive-date=2021-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210617105644/https://www.otempo.com.br/mobile/gastro/tradicao-x-modernidade-na-comida-japonesa-1.1103456?amp|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Golden Maki Rainbow Roll sushi.jpg|thumb|Rainbow roll, {{transliteration|ja|uramaki}} with multiple fillings including shrimp tempura, salmon, avocado, mango, with rice mixed with {{transliteration|ja|tobiko}}]]
Multiple-filling rolls inspired by {{transliteration|ja|[[#Makizushi|futomaki]]}} are a more popular type of sushi within the [[United States]] and come in variations that take their names from their places of origin. Other rolls may include a variety of ingredients, including chopped scallops, spicy tuna, beef or chicken [[teriyaki]] roll, [[okra]], and assorted vegetables such as cucumber and avocado, and the [[tempura]] roll, where shrimp tempura is inside the roll or the entire roll is battered and fried tempura-style. In the Southern United States, many sushi restaurants prepare rolls using [[crawfish]]. Sometimes, rolls are made with brown rice or black rice, known as forbidden rice, which appear in Japanese cuisine as well.

Per [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulations, raw fish served in the United States must be frozen before serving to kill parasites.<ref>{{cite news |author=Julia Moskin |title=Sushi Fresh From the Deep. .. the Deep Freeze |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/08/nyregion/sushi-fresh-from-the-deep-the-deep-freeze.html |quote=Most would be even more surprised to learn that if the sushi has not been frozen, it is illegal to serve it in the United States. Food and Drug Administration regulations stipulate that fish to be eaten raw – whether as sushi, sashimi, seviche, or tartare – must be frozen first to kill parasites. |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 8, 2004 |access-date=2013-12-23 |archive-date=2014-01-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106075149/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/08/nyregion/sushi-fresh-from-the-deep-the-deep-freeze.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Since rolls are often made to order, it is not unusual for the customer to specify the exact ingredients desired (e.g., salmon roll, cucumber roll, avocado roll, tuna roll, shrimp or tuna tempura roll, etc.).

==Ingredients==
[[File:Making Sushi.webmhd.webm|thumb|Video of making sushi without fish]]
[[File:Sushichef.jpg|thumb|right|Sushi chef preparing {{transliteration|ja|nigirizushi}}, [[Kyoto]], Japan]]

All sushi has a base of specially prepared rice, complemented with other ingredients. Traditional Japanese sushi consists of rice flavored with vinegar sauce and various raw or cooked ingredients.

{{Anchor|sushi rice}}

===''Sushi-meshi''===
{{Further|Japonica rice|Japanese rice}}
{{nihongo||鮨飯|Sushi-meshi}} (also known as {{nihongo||酢飯|su-meshi}}, {{nihongo||舎利|shari}}, or {{nihongo||ご飯|gohan}}) is a preparation of white, short-grained, [[Japanese rice]] mixed with a dressing consisting of rice vinegar, sugar, salt, and occasionally [[kombu]] and sake. It must be cooled to room temperature before being used for a sushi filling, or it will get too sticky while seasoned. Traditionally, it is mixed with a [[hangiri]] (a round, flat-bottom wooden tub or barrel) and a {{transliteration|ja|[[shamoji]]}} (a wooden paddle).

Sushi rice is prepared with short-grain Japanese rice, which has a consistency that differs from long-grain strains such as those from [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Bangladesh]], Thailand, and Vietnam. The essential quality is its stickiness or glutinousness, although the type of rice used for sushi differs from [[glutinous rice]]. Freshly harvested rice ({{transliteration|ja|shinmai}}) typically contains too much water and requires extra time to drain the rice cooker after washing. In some [[fusion cuisine]] restaurants, short-grain brown rice and [[wild rice]] are also used.

There are regional variations in sushi rice, and individual chefs have their methods. Most of the variations are in the rice vinegar dressing: the [[Kantō region]] (or East Japan) version of the dressing commonly uses more salt; in Kansai region (or West Japan), the dressing has more sugar.

===Nori===
{{Main|Nori}}

[[File:Nori.jpg|thumb|Sheets of nori]]
The dark green seaweed wrappers used in {{transliteration|ja|makimono}} are called {{nihongo|nori|海苔}}. Nori is a type of [[red algae]], typically in the family [[Bangiaceae]], traditionally cultivated in the harbors of Japan. Many different foliose red algae species are [[Seaweed farming|cultivated]] to be used as sushi wrappers, however ''[[Pyropia tenera]]'' is the most commonly farmed. This species ranks among the top three most commonly cultivated seaweed species in China, Korea, and Japan.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=Lishu |last2=Liao |first2=Wei |last3=Huang |first3=Yajun |last4=Wen |first4=Yuxi |last5=Chu |first5=Yaoyao |last6=Zhao |first6=Chao |display-authors=1 |date=13 October 2022 |title=Global seaweed farming and processing in the past 20 years |journal=Food Production, Processing and Nutrition |volume=4 |issue=23 |page=2 |doi=10.1186/s43014-022-00103-2 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Originally, algae was scraped from dock pilings, rolled out into thin, edible sheets, and dried in the sun, similar to making [[Bánh tráng|rice paper]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWLTngEACAAJ|title=The Japanese Kitchen: 250 Recipes in a Traditional Spirit|last=Shimbo|first=Hiroko|date=2000-11-08|publisher=Harvard Common Press|isbn=9781558321779|page=128|language=en|quote=Unlike wakame, kombu, and hijiki, which are sold in the form of individual leaves, nori is sold as a sheet made from small, soft, dark brown algae, which have been cultivated in bays and lagoons since the middle of the Edo Era (1600 to 1868). The technique of drying the collected algae on wooden frames was borrowed from the famous Japanese paper-making industry.|access-date=2020-10-16|archive-date=2021-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210617105727/https://books.google.com/books?id=VWLTngEACAAJ|url-status=live}}</ref> Today, the commercial product is farmed, processed, toasted, packaged, and sold in sheets.

The size of a nori sheet influences the size of {{transliteration|ja|makimono}}. A full-size sheet produces {{transliteration|ja|futomaki}}, and a half produces {{transliteration|ja|hosomaki}} and {{transliteration|ja|temaki}}. To produce {{transliteration|ja|gunkan}} and some other {{transliteration|ja|makimono}}, an appropriately sized piece of nori is cut from a whole sheet.

Nori by itself is an edible snack and is available with salt or flavored with teriyaki sauce. The flavored variety, however, tends to be of lesser quality and is not suitable for sushi.

When making {{transliteration|ja|fukusazushi}}, a paper-thin omelet may replace a sheet of nori as the wrapping. The omelet is traditionally made on a rectangular omelet pan, known as a {{transliteration|ja|[[makiyakinabe]]}}, and used to form the pouch for the rice and fillings.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E93DajzW57cC&q=fukusazushi|title=Simply sushi|last=Pallett|first=Steven|date=2004|publisher=Hinkler Books|isbn=9781741219722|page=289|language=en|access-date=2020-10-16|archive-date=2021-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210617105648/https://books.google.com/books?id=E93DajzW57cC&q=fukusazushi|url-status=live}}</ref>

Tofu, eggs (in the form of slightly sweet, layered omelette called {{transliteration|ja|tamagoyaki}}), and raw quail eggs (as a {{transliteration|ja|gunkan-maki}} topping) are also common.

===Condiments===
Sushi is commonly eaten with condiments. Sushi may be dipped in {{transliteration|ja|[[shōyu]]}} (soy sauce), and is usually flavored with wasabi, a piquant paste made from the grated stem of the ''[[Wasabi|Wasabia japonica]]'' plant. [[Kewpie (mayonnaise)|Japanese-style mayonnaise]] is a common condiment in Japan on salmon, pork, and other sushi cuts.

The traditional grating tool for wasabi is a sharkskin grater or {{transliteration|ja|samegawa oroshi}}. An imitation wasabi ({{transliteration|ja|seiyo-wasabi}}), made from [[horseradish]], mustard powder, and green dye, is common. It is found at lower-end {{transliteration|ja|kaiten-zushi}} restaurants, in bento box sushi, and at most restaurants outside Japan. If manufactured in Japan, it may be labelled "Japanese Horseradish".<ref>{{cite book|author=Shimbo, Hiroko|title=The Japanese Kitchen |publisher=[[Harvard Common Press]]|year=2000| isbn = 978-1-55832-176-2}}</ref> The spicy compound in both true and imitation wasabi is [[allyl isothiocyanate]], which has well-known [[Antimicrobial|anti-microbial]] properties.

{{transliteration|ja|Gari}} (sweet, pickled ginger) is eaten in between sushi courses to both cleanse the palate and aid in digestion. In Japan, [[green tea]] ({{transliteration|ja|ocha}}) is invariably served together with sushi. Better sushi restaurants often use a distinctive premium tea known as {{transliteration|ja|[[mecha tea|mecha]]}}. In sushi vocabulary, green tea is known as {{transliteration|ja|agari}}.

Sushi may be garnished with {{transliteration|ja|[[Burdock root|gobo]]}}, grated {{transliteration|ja|daikon}}, thinly sliced vegetables, carrots, radishes, and cucumbers that have been shaped to look like flowers, real flowers, or seaweed salad.

When closely arranged on a tray, different pieces are often separated by green strips called {{transliteration|ja|baran}} or {{nihongo||切り笹|kiri-zasa}}. These dividers prevent the flavors of neighboring pieces of sushi from mixing and help to achieve an attractive presentation. Originally, these were cut leaves from the {{nihongo|''[[Aspidistra elatior]]''|葉蘭|haran}} and {{nihongo|''Sasa veitchii''|熊笹|kuma-zasa}} plants, respectively. Using actual leaves had the added benefit of releasing antimicrobial [[phytoncide]]s when cut, thereby extending the limited shelf life of the sushi.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Bento grass|url = http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2008/01/15/reference/bento-grass/|newspaper = The Japan Times Online|date = 2008-01-15|access-date = 2015-12-08|issn = 0447-5763|language = en-US|first = Alice|last = Gordenker|archive-date = 2015-12-10|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151210181230/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2008/01/15/reference/bento-grass/|url-status = live}}</ref>

Sushi bento boxes are a staple of Japanese supermarkets and convenience stores. As these stores began rising in prominence in the 1960s, the labor-intensive cut leaves were increasingly replaced with green plastic to lower costs. This coincided with the increased prevalence of refrigeration, which extended sushi's shelf life without the need for cut leaves. Today plastic strips are commonly used in sushi bento boxes and, to a lesser degree, in sushi presentations found in sushi bars and restaurants. In store-sold or to-go packages of sushi, the plastic leaf strips are often used to prevent the rolls from coming into early or unwanted contact with the ginger and wasabi included with the dish.<ref>{{cite web |date=June 21, 2010 |title=Culinary Curiosities: That plastic leaf in sushi |url=http://eatocracy.cnn.com/2010/06/21/plastic-sushi-lea/ |publisher=CNN |access-date=September 22, 2013 |archive-date=September 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926225233/http://eatocracy.cnn.com/2010/06/21/plastic-sushi-lea/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Health risks==
{{See also|Fish diseases and parasites}}
Potential chemical and biological hazards in sushi include environmental contaminants, [[pathogen]]s, and toxins.

Large marine [[apex predator]]s such as [[tuna]] (especially [[Pacific bluefin tuna|bluefin]]) can harbor high levels of [[methylmercury]], one of many toxins of [[marine pollution]]. Frequent or significantly large consumption of methylmercury can lead to developmental defects when consumed by certain higher-risk groups, including women who are pregnant or may become pregnant, nursing mothers, and young children.<ref>{{cite web | access-date = 2012-09-18 | date = 2004-03-01 | url = https://www.fda.gov/food/foodsafety/product-specificinformation/seafood/foodbornepathogenscontaminants/methylmercury/ucm115662.htm | title = Methylmercury: What You Need to Know About Mercury in Fish and Shellfish | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration]] | archive-date = 2013-03-17 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130317130031/http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/Product-SpecificInformation/Seafood/FoodbornePathogensContaminants/Methylmercury/ucm115662.htm | url-status = dead }}</ref> A 2021 study in [[Catalonia]], Spain reported that the estimated exposure to methylmercury in sushi consumption by adolescents exceeded the tolerable daily intake.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=González |first1=N |last2=Correig |first2=E |last3=Marmelo |first3=I |last4=Marques |first4=A |last5=la Cour |first5=R |last6=Sloth |first6=JJ |last7=Nadal |first7=M |last8=Marquès |first8=M |last9=Domingo |first9=JL |title=Dietary exposure to potentially toxic elements through sushi consumption in Catalonia, Spain. |journal=Food and Chemical Toxicology |date=July 2021 |volume=153 |article-number=112285 |doi=10.1016/j.fct.2021.112285 |pmid=34023460|s2cid=235168607 |doi-access=free |hdl=20.500.11797/imarina9216104 |hdl-access=free }}</ref>

Some forms of sushi, notably those containing the [[fugu|fugu pufferfish]] and some kinds of shellfish, can cause severe poisoning if not prepared properly. Fugu consumption, in particular, can be fatal. Fugu pufferfish have a lethal dose of [[tetrodotoxin]] in their internal organs and, by law in many countries, must be prepared by a licensed fugu-chef who has passed the prefectural examination in Japan.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FvgNKPxb43IC&q=fugu+license&pg=PA390|title=Molecules of death|first1=Rosemary H.|last1=Warin|first2=Glyn B.|last2=Steventon|first3=Steve C.|last3=Mitchell|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2007|page=390|isbn=978-1-86094-814-5|access-date=2020-10-16|archive-date=2021-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210617105648/https://books.google.com/books?id=FvgNKPxb43IC&q=fugu+license&pg=PA390|url-status=live}}</ref> Licensing involves a written test, a fish-identification test, and a practical test that involves preparing the fugu and separating out the poisonous organs; only about 35 percent of applicants pass.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/29/travel/one-man-s-fugu-is-another-s-poison.html|url-access=subscription| work=The New York Times | title=One Man's Fugu Is Another's Poison | date=1981-11-29 | access-date=2011-02-26 | archive-date=2015-05-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524085250/http://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/29/travel/one-man-s-fugu-is-another-s-poison.html | url-status=live }}</ref>

==Etiquette==
{{see also|Customs and etiquette in Japanese dining}}
Unlike sashimi, which is almost always eaten with chopsticks, {{transliteration|ja|nigirizushi}} is traditionally eaten with the fingers, even in formal settings.<ref>Issenberg, Sasha. ''The Sushi Economy''. Gotham Books: 2007</ref> Although it is commonly served on a small platter with a side dish for dipping, sushi can also be served in a bento, a box with small compartments that hold the various dishes of the meal.

Soy sauce is the usual condiment, and sushi is normally served with a small sauce dish or a compartment in the bento. Traditional etiquette suggests that the sushi is turned over so that only the topping is dipped to flavor it; the rice—which has already been seasoned with rice wine vinegar, sugar, salt, mirin, and kombu—would otherwise absorb too much soy sauce and would fall apart.<ref name=honey>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/article/603883 |title=Are you sushi savvy? |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |access-date=2009-11-09 |first=Kim |last=Honey |date=March 18, 2009 |archive-date=2009-03-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323041355/http://www.thestar.com/article/603883 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Traditionally, the sushi chef will add an appropriate amount of wasabi to the sushi while preparing it, and the diner should not add more.<ref name=honey/> However, today, wasabi is more a matter of personal taste, and even restaurants in Japan may serve wasabi on the side for customers to use at their discretion, even when there is wasabi already in the dish.<ref>{{cite book
