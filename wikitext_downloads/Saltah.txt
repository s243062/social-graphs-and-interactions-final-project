'''Saltah''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: سلتة) is a traditional Yemeni dish. ''Saltah'' is considered to be the [[national dish]] of [[Yemen]]. In the [[Ottoman Empire]], ''saltah'' was used as a charitable food and was made with leftover food that was donated by the wealthy or the mosques. It is widely eaten in northern parts of the country. It is mainly served for lunch. The base is a brown [[meat]] stew called ''[[Maraq (dish)|maraq]]'', a dollop of [[fenugreek]] froth, and ''[[sahawiq]]'' (a mixture of [[Chili pepper|chillies]], [[tomato]]es, [[garlic]], and [[herb]]s ground into a [[Salsa (sauce)|salsa]]). [[Rice]], [[potato]]es, [[scrambled eggs]], [[sambal]] and [[vegetable]]s are common additions to ''saltah''. It is eaten traditionally with ''[[khubz mulawah]]'', a Yemeni flatbread used as a utensil to scoop up the dish.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Benayoun |first=Mike |date=2015-11-22 |title=Saltah |url=https://www.196flavors.com/yemen-saltah/ |access-date=2023-11-11 |website=196 flavors |language=en-US}}</ref>
