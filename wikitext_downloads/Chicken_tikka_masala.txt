'''Chicken tikka masala''' is a dish consisting of roasted marinated chicken pieces ([[chicken tikka]]) in a spiced sauce ([[masala (spice)|masala]]). The sauce is usually creamy and orange-coloured. The origins of the dish are debated, with many believing it was [[Curry in the United Kingdom|created by South Asian cooks in Britain.]] It is offered at restaurants around the world and is similar to [[butter chicken]].

The origin of chicken tikka masala is not certain, but many sources attribute it to the [[British Asian|South Asian community]] in Great Britain.<ref name=Britannica/><ref>{{cite web |last=Dutt |first=Vijay |title=60 years of Chicken Tikka Masala |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/60-years-of-chicken-tikka-masala/story-cPUJ0MAdX4WxqcxYTrqA3H.html |website=Hindustan Times |access-date=13 December 2021 |date=21 October 2007}}</ref><ref name="ghosh bb">{{cite news |last1=Ghosh |first1=Bobby |title=How I Learned to Stop Hating and Respect Chicken Tikka Masala |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-19/who-created-chicken-tikka-masala-history-of-uk-s-national-dish |access-date=26 February 2023 |work=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=19 January 2023 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Taylor |first1=Emma |title=Most people have no clue chicken tikka masala isn't an Indian dish, according to a top Indian chef |url=https://www.insider.com/chicken-tikka-masala-not-indian-dishoom-chef-naved-nasir-2019-11 |website=Insider |access-date=13 December 2021}}</ref>

Chicken tikka masala may derive from [[butter chicken]], a popular dish in the northern [[Indian subcontinent]]. The ''Multicultural Handbook of Food, Nutrition and Dietetics'' credits its creation to [[British Bangladeshi|Bangladeshi migrant]] chefs in Britain in the 1960s. They developed and served a number of new inauthentic "Indian" dishes, including chicken tikka masala.<ref name="Handbook">{{cite book |last1=Thaker |first1=Aruna |last2=Barton |first2=Arlene |title=Multicultural Handbook of Food, Nutrition and Dietetics |date=2012 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |isbn=9781405173582 |page=74 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YF1YCg5Ig-EC&pg=PA74}}</ref> 

The historians of ethnic food Peter and Colleen Grove discuss multiple claims regarding the origin of chicken tikka masala, concluding that the dish "was most certainly invented in Britain, probably by a Bangladeshi chef."<ref name=MenuMag>{{cite web |author1=Grove, Peter |author2=Grove, Colleen |url=http://www.menumagazine.co.uk/book/tikkamasala.html |website=Menu Magazine |publisher=Grove Publications |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127225804/http://www.menumagazine.co.uk/book/tikkamasala.html|archive-date=27 November 2016 |title=Is It or Isn't It?

Another claim is that it originated in a restaurant in [[Glasgow]], Scotland.<ref name="Glasgow 2016">{{cite news|title=From Charles Mackintosh's waterproof to Dolly the sheep: 43 innovations Scotland has given the world|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/charles-mackintosh-chemist-waterproof-google-doodle-scotland-inventions-innovation-bicycles-a7499911.html|work=The Independent|date=30 December 2016}}</ref><ref name="book"/> This version recounts how a [[British Pakistanis|British Pakistani]] chef, [[Ali Ahmed Aslam]], proprietor of a restaurant in Glasgow, invented chicken tikka masala by improvising a sauce made from a tin of condensed tomato soup, and spices.<ref name="Glasgow">{{cite web |date=21 July 2009 |title=Glasgow 'invented' Tikka Masala |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8161812.stm |access-date=19 May 2017 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |quote=Mr Sarwar claimed the dish owed its origins to the culinary skills of Ali Ahmed Aslam, proprietor of the Shish Mahal restaurant in Park Road in the west end of the city.

Chef Anita Jaisinghani wrote in the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' that "the most likely story is that the modern version was created during the early '70s by an enterprising Indian chef near London" who used [[Campbell's]] tomato soup.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.houstonchronicle.com/food-culture/article/How-to-make-Anita-Jaisinghani-s-butter-chicken-15914236.php|title=How to make Pondicheri's butter chicken at home|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|url-access=subscription|date=2021-02-01|accessdate=2021-03-15 |last1=Jaisinghani |first1=Anita}}</ref> However, restaurant owner [[Iqbal Wahhab]] claims that he and Peter Grove fabricated the story of a chef using tomato soup to create chicken tikka masala in order "to entertain journalists".<ref name="Monroe">{{cite book |last1=Monroe |first1=Jo |title=Star of India: The Spicy Adventures of Curry |date=September 2005 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-0-470-09188-3 |pages=135–137 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NC42BaKAwXAC&pg=PA135 |quote="An enterprising chef then looked around for something to make a sauce from and found a tin of Campbell's condensed tomato soup.
