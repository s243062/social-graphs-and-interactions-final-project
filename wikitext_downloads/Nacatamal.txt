A '''''nacatamal''''' ([[Nahuat]]: Nakatamal, ''Nakat'' "meat", ''tamal'' "tamale") ([[Nahuatl]]: Nacatamal, ''Nacatl'' "meat", ''tamalli'' "tamale") is a traditional [[Nicaraguan]] dish similar to the ''[[Tamale|tamal]]'' and to the ''[[hallaca]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://insiderspanish.com/posts/nicaraguan-spanish/nacatamal-a-nicaraguan-delicacy/|title = THE NACATAMAL IN NICARAGUA A LOCAL DELICACY}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://mike.polischuk.net/2018/12/catarina-nicaragua-best-nacatamales/|title = Catarina Where Nicaraguas Best Nacatamales Are Sold From Homes}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1996-12-05-fo-5881-story.html|title = Its Nacatamal Time}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://recipe.deshilearners.com/nacatamales-recipe/#google_vignette|title = Authentic Nicaraguan Nacatamales Recipe}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://studygroom.com/geography-of-nacatamal/|title = Geography of Nacatamal}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.melonthego.com/cooking-class-eating-nacatamales-in-someones-backyard/|title = Cooking Class Eating Nacatamales in Someones Backyard}}</ref> Nacatamales have [[Mesoamerica|Mesoamerican]] roots, and originated from the [[Nicarao people|Nicarao tribes]] who inhabited western Nicaragua, its name originates from the [[Nawat]] language and translates to 'meat tamale'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lifestyleandfoodconsultant.com/other-writings/tag/Acculturation+of+Nicarao%22s+people|title = THE ACCULTURATION OF THE NICARAO NATIVES IN NICARAGUA}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://mheescape.mheducation.com/2018/12/10/el-nacatamal-nicaraguense/ |title = The Nicaraguan Nacatamal}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latinpost.com/articles/161066/20230930/nicaragua-food-5-try-traditional-dishes-central-american-country.htm|title= Five Traditional Nicaraguan Food You Must Try}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://inventedrecipes.com/recipe/1126 |title = Nacatamal A Taste of Nicaraguan Tradition Wrapped in Banana Leaves}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://recetasdecomida.pro/receta-para-hacer-nacatamales-nicaraguenses/8|title= Recipes for Nicaraguan Nacatamales}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefooddictator.com/the-hirshon-nicaraguan-pork-nacatamal/|title= THE HIRSHON NICARAGUAN PORK NACATAMAL}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/nacatamales-are-the-fatty-meat-filled-tamales-of-nicaragua/ |title = Nacatamales Are the Fatty, Meat-Filled Tamales of Nicaragua}}</ref> In the [[pre-Columbian]] era, the Nicarao used meats like [[Venison|deer]], [[turkey meat|turkey]], and [[Iguana meat|iguana]] with ingredients such as [[tomatoes]], [[potato|potatoes]], [[chili pepper|chilis]], [[Annatto|achiote]], and [[herbs]] to season and increase the nacatamal's flavor before being wrapped in corn husks and steamed. After Spanish conquest, nacatamales were made with introduced meats like [[pork]] and [[chicken as food|chicken]]. They also evolved to include flavorful ingredients like onions and banana leaves replaced corn husks.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://travelfoodatlas.com/nicaraguan-nacatamales-recipe |title = Nicaraguan Nacatamales Recipe}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nicaraguanrecipes.com/nacatamal-recipe/ |title = Nicaraguan Recipes}}</ref> Raisins can also be added, however raisins are optional and not a requirement for nacatamales. The ''nacatamal'' is perhaps the most produced within traditional Nicaraguan cuisine and is typically eaten on the weekend, for dinner, or for breakfast; it is usually eaten together with white bread and a caffeinated drink like black coffee, Coca-Cola or Pepsi. It is common to enjoy ''nacatamales'' (plural) during special occasions and to invite extended family and neighbors to partake.

==Ingredients==
A ''nacatamal'' is made up of mostly [[nixtamalization|nixtamalized]] [[corn]] ''masa'' (a kind of [[dough]] traditionally made from a process called ''nizquezar'') and [[lard]], but includes seasonings such as salt and ''achiote'' ([[annatto]]). This combination is traditionally cooked in a large batch over a wood fire. The result becomes the base for the ''nacatamal'' and it is also referred to as ''masa''. This base is ladled onto plantain leaves used for wrapping into large individual portions. The leaves undergo their own preparation separately. Before a ''nacatamal'' can be wrapped and brought to the last stage of the cooking process, it must be filled. The filling usually consists of annatto-seasoned pork meat; rice; slices of [[potatoes]], [[bell peppers]], [[tomatoes]], and [[onions]]; [[olive]]s; spearmint sprigs; and [[Pequin pepper|chile {{not a typo|congo}}]], a very small, egg-shaped chile found in Nicaragua. On occasion, prunes, raisins or capers can be added. The masa and filling are then wrapped in the plantain leaves, tied with a string, and made into pillow-shaped bundles. These ''nacatamales'' are then steamed or [[pressure cooking|pressure-cooked]] for several hours. The entire process is very labor-intensive and it often requires preparation over the course of two days; it may be necessary to involve the whole family to complete it.

Today it is common to wrap ''nacatamales'' in both banana leaf and aluminum foil before cooking. Cooking takes up to five hours and at the midway point the ''nacatamales'' are turned over to facilitate even cooking.
