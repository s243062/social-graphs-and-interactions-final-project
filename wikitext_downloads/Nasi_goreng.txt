Similar to other fried rice recipes in Asia, commentators have suggested that Indonesian-style ''nasi goreng'' can trace its origins to [[Chinese fried rice]], and was likely developed as a way to avoid wasting rice.<ref name="Historia-NG">{{Cite web|url=https://historia.id/kuliner/articles/pesona-nasi-goreng-P0mrK|title=Pesona Nasi Goreng|first =Martin |last =Sitompul| date = 28 July 2017|website=Historia – Obrolan Perempuan Urban|language=id-ID|access-date=19 September 2018}}</ref><ref name="Street Food Around the World">{{cite book| title = Street Food Around the World: An Encyclopedia of Food and Culture | author1=Bruce Kraig | author2=Colleen Taylor Sen | publisher = ABC-CLIO | year = 2013 | isbn=9781598849554| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9XCjAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA183 | page = 183}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Akulturasi Budaya di Balik Makanan Nusantara | author = Mutia Silviani Aflakhah | work = Good News from Indonesia | date = 9 February 2017 | url = https://www.goodnewsfromindonesia.id/2017/02/09/akulturasi-budaya-di-balik-makanan-nusantara | language = id}}</ref> The Chinese influences upon Indonesian cuisine can be seen in ''[[mie goreng]]'' that appeared simultaneously with the introduction of the [[stir frying]] technique that required the use of a Chinese [[wok]].<ref>{{cite book | title = A New Approach to Indonesian Cooking | author = Heinz Von Holzen | publisher = Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd | year = 2014 | isbn = 9789814634953 | page = 15 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pRuiBQAAQBAJ&q=Kwetiau+Goreng&pg=PA15 }}</ref> In China, the stir frying technique became increasingly popular during the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644 CE).<ref>{{cite book | title = Stir-Frying to the Sky's Edge: The Ultimate Guide to Mastery, with Authentic Recipes and Stories | author = Grace Young | publisher = Simon and Schuster | year = 2010 | isbn = 9781416580577| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=buSaBAAAQBAJ&q=Stir+frying+Ming+dynasty&pg=PA49 | page = 49}}</ref> The common [[soy sauce]] has its origin in 2nd-century CE China; however, ''kecap manis'' ([[sweet soy sauce]]) was developed in Indonesia with a generous addition of local [[palm sugar]].<ref name="Soyinfo-Tempeh">{{cite book | title = History of Tempeh and Tempeh Products (1815–2011): Extensively Annotated Bibliography and Sourcebook | author1= William Shurtleff| author2= Akiko Aoyagi | publisher = Soyinfo Center | year = 2011 |isbn = 9781928914396 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qhsOY1z6-T8C&q=Kecap+manis+Indonesia&pg=PA618 | page = 618 }}</ref>

=== Introduction to Southeast Asia through Chinese migration and culinary influence===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De Chinese zeilschepen Yonken Sin Tong Heng (links) en Tek Hwa Seng bij Poeloe Samboe TMnr 10010680.jpg|thumb|left|Chinese junks carried merchants and sailors across the South China Sea, spreading foodways such as fried rice]]
The expansion of [[Maritime Silk Road|Chinese maritime trade]] from the [[Tang dynasty]] (7th–10th centuries) established enduring connections between China and Southeast Asia. Chinese [[merchant]]s, sailors and envoys regularly visited major ports and trading centres across Java, Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Indochina and the Philippines. These ports became hubs of [[Cultural diplomacy|cultural exchange]], where culinary practices merged with local religion, language and [[material culture]].<ref name="Yangzhou Fried Rice: The Journey from Leftover Rice to Culinary Icon">{{Cite web|title=Yangzhou Fried Rice: The Journey from Leftover Rice to Culinary Icon|url=https://www.dionefood.com/en/blogs/0017-yangzhou-fried-rice-the-journey-from-leftover-rice-to-culinary-icon|access-date=21 September 2025}}</ref>

It is unclear when the people of present-day Indonesia began to adopt the practice of cooking fried rice. The [[China–Indonesia relations|trade between China and the Indonesian archipelago]] flourished from the era of [[Srivijaya]] around the 10th century and intensified in the [[Majapahit]] era around the 15th century. By that time Chinese immigrants had begun to settle in the archipelago, bringing along with them their culture and [[Chinese Indonesian cuisine|cuisine]]. Chinese people usually favor freshly cooked hot food, and it is taboo to throw away uneaten foodstuffs in their culture.<ref name="Historia-NG"/> As a result, the previous day's leftover rice was often recooked in the morning. Gregory Rodgers suggested that frying the rice could prevent the propagation of dangerous microbes, especially in pre-refrigeration technology in Indonesia, and also avoid the need to throw out precious food.

Within these exchanges, Chinese [[cooking techniques]] and dishes began to take root. [[Fried rice]], with its simplicity and adaptability, was particularly well suited to maritime communities. The dish required only basic cooking equipment, a small amount of oil and whatever ingredients were readily available. Its portability and reliance on leftover rice made it practical for both travellers and settled communities.<ref name="Slices of History on Your Plate: Chinese Influence on Southeast Asian Dishes">{{Cite web|title=Slices of History on Your Plate: Chinese Influence on Southeast Asian Dishes|url=https://seasia.co/2025/06/01/slices-of-history-on-your-plate-chinese-influence-on-southeast-asian-dishes|access-date=21 September 2025}}</ref>

Beyond temporary traders, long-term [[Emigration|migration]] from [[southern China]] brought large numbers of [[Hoklo people|Hokkien]], [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]], [[Hakka people|Hakka]] and [[Teochew people|Teochew settlers]] to South-East Asia between the 10th and 19th centuries. These communities established themselves in major [[Port|port cities]] and trading centres such as [[Jakarta|Batavia]] (modern Jakarta), [[Semarang]], [[Medan]], [[Malacca City|Malacca]], [[Penang]], [[Singapore]], [[Bangkok]], [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]] and [[Manila]], others settled in smaller towns and rural areas, particularly in regions linked to agriculture, mining and riverine trade. These communities formed [[Chinatown|Chinatowns]], built temples and maintained strong culinary traditions.<ref name="Migration and Trade: The Role of Overseas Chinese in Economic Relations between China and Southeast Asia">{{Cite web|title=Migration and Trade: The Role of Overseas Chinese in Economic Relations between China and Southeast Asia|url=https://ics.um.edu.my/img/files/zhuangwang.pdf|access-date=21 September 2025}}</ref>

Among the dishes they introduced were fried rice, [[Noodle|noodles]], [[Dumpling|dumplings]] and [[stir-fried]] vegetables, all prepared with techniques familiar from southern China.<ref name="Slices of History on Your Plate: Chinese Influence on Southeast Asian Dishes"/> Over time, these dishes began to be [[Cultural diplomacy|adopted]] by local populations, who incorporated their own spices and ingredients. Fried rice in particular became a bridge between Chinese and local cuisines, as it could be easily adapted to different palates and available foodstuffs.

=== Local adaptation===

''Nasi goreng'' is mentioned in early 19th century [[Javanese literature]] ''[[Serat Centhini]]'' as ''sekul goreng''.<ref name="Kuliner-Centhini">{{Cite book |title=Kuliner Jawa dalam Serat Centhini |author1=Wahjudi Pantja Sunjata |author2=Sumarno |author3=Titi Mumfangati |url=https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpnbyogyakarta/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2015/01/Kuliner_Dalam_Serat_Centhini.pdf |access-date=2025-01-20 |publisher=Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan Balai Pelestarian Nilai Budaya Yogyakarta |location=Yogyakarta |date=2014 |page=48 |language=id}}</ref> However, according to Harry Nazarudin, a culinary expert, the fried rice written in this Javanese book is different from the fried rice we know today. This fried rice is made without using soy sauce and is not eaten as a single dish like fried rice in general, but is a variant of rice that is eaten with side dishes. On the island of Java there are two types of fried rice; the Sundanese ''gagrak'' fried rice is savory, and the Javanese one tends to be sweet. ''Sekul goreng'' mentioned in Serat Centhini is the closest to the Sundanese version.<ref name="YSNB-Nasi">{{Cite web |date=25 December 2022 |title=Nasi Sebagai Sumber Karbohidrat dan Olahannya di Jaman Jawa Kuno |url=https://www.suluhnuswantarabakti.or.id/9399/nasi-sebagai-sumber-karbohidrat-dan-olahannya-di-jaman-jawa-kuno.html |access-date=2025-01-20 |website=Yayasan Suluh Nuswantara Bakti |language=id}}</ref>

Writer Fadly Rahman from Padjajaran University claimed that there is no historical evidence that proves that ''nasi goreng'' is native to Indonesia, and suggested another theory besides Chinese influence: that ''nasi goreng'' was actually inspired by a Middle Eastern dish called ''[[pilaf]]'', which is rice cooked in seasoned broth.<ref name="JP-Ulung">{{cite news | title = Tracing history of Indonesian culinary fare | author = A.

By the 19th century, colonial-era records described fried rice as part of the daily diet in [[Javanese culture|Javanese]] and [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay households]]. Its popularity was linked to practicality: leftover rice could be quickly transformed into a complete meal, often supplemented with eggs, small amounts of meat or [[salted fish]].<ref name="Nasi Goreng History: All About Indonesia’s Famous Fried Rice">{{Cite web|title=Nasi Goreng History: All About Indonesia’s Famous Fried Rice|url=https://foodicles.com/nasi-goreng-history/|access-date=21 September 2025}}</ref> By the early 20th century, Dutch–Indonesian cookbooks included recipes for ''nasi goreng'', indicating its integration into both local and colonial kitchens.

=== Colonial-era influence ===
[[File:126v.jpg|thumb|upright|A 19th-century recipe for ''nasi goreng'' written in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], from an ''[[Album amicorum]]'' of the [[Royal Library of the Netherlands]]]]
''Nasi goreng'' was considered as part of the Indies culture during the colonial period. The mention of ''nasi goreng'' appears in colonial literature of [[Dutch East Indies]], such as in the ''Student Hidjo'' by Marco Kartodikoromo, a serial story published in [[Sinar Hindia]] newspaper in 1918.<ref name="Historia-NG"/> It was mentioned in a 1925 Dutch cookbook ''Groot Nieuw Volledig Oost Indisch Kookboek''.<ref>{{cite book |last=van der Meijden |first=J.M.J. Catenius |year=1925 |title=Groot Nieuw Volledig Oost Indisch Kookboek |language=nl |url=http://weeten.nl/assets/vergetenboeken/Indisch_Kookboek.pdf |location=Den Haag |publisher=Goor Zonen Den Haag |page=1 }}</ref> Trade between the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies during that time has increased the popularity of Indonesian-style ''nasi goreng'' to the world.<ref>{{cite journal |date=April 1984 |title=Standardisasi Perencah Nasi Goreng Masih Perlu Lokakarya Lanjutan |journal=Selera |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=39–42 }}</ref>

The colonial period introduced new dynamics to the development of fried rice in Southeast Asia. European powers such as the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], [[Dutch colonial empire|Dutch]] and [[British Empire|British]] dominated spice and commodity trade in the region, indirectly influencing local cuisines. Fried rice itself, however, remained primarily a Chinese culinary tradition. The wider circulation of seasonings such as soy sauce, chilli, pepper and nutmeg helped shape regional adaptations, particularly ''nasi goreng''.<ref name="How Malaysia's Colonial Past Shaped Its Food Culture">{{Cite web|title=How Malaysia's Colonial Past Shaped Its Food Culture|url=https://www.openhouse.my/journal/colonial-food-influences|access-date=21 September 2025}}</ref>

In the [[Dutch East Indies]], recipes for ''nasi goreng'' appeared in late 19th- and early 20th-century cookbooks compiled for European households, while in [[British Malaya]] and the [[Straits Settlements]], similar preparations were noted across Malay, Chinese and Indian Muslim communities. Despite these colonial-era records, fried rice continued to be prepared in domestic kitchens, sold by street vendors and consumed across social classes, underscoring its role as an integral part of local food culture.<ref name="2.2 Historical influences: trade, migration, and colonization">{{Cite web|title=2.2 Historical influences: trade, migration, and colonization|url=https://fiveable.me/international-food-culture/unit-2/historical-influences-trade-migration-colonization/study-guide/kROgq7Kky9Y3vL28|access-date=21 September 2025}}</ref><ref name="Colonizers' Influence Infuses Southeast Asian Cuisine">{{Cite web|title=Colonizers' Influence Infuses Southeast Asian Cuisine|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/10/18/141465353/colonizers-influence-infuses-southeast-asian-cuisine|access-date=21 September 2025}}</ref>

During this period, ''nasi goreng'' also spread beyond Southeast Asia with colonial migration and trade, introduced to [[Dutch Ceylon|Sri Lanka]] by the [[Sri Lankan Malays|Sri Lankan Malay]] community, to the [[Netherlands]] by [[Indo people|Indo-Dutch]] migrants and to [[Suriname]] by [[Javanese Surinamese|Javanese-Surinamese]] settlers, where it became incorporated into local culinary traditions.

During the [[Indonesian National Revolution|Indonesian struggle for independence]], ''nasi goreng'' was served as the ''[[Suhur|sahur]]'' meal when [[Sukarno]], [[Mohammad Hatta]] and [[Ahmad Soebardjo]] drafted the [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|proclamation text]], in the early morning before dawn of 17 August 1945, at [[Formulation of Proclamation Text Museum|the residence]] of a high-ranking Japanese naval officer, [[Tadashi Maeda (admiral)|Admiral Maeda]].

''Nasi goreng'' that is commonly consumed daily in Indonesian households were considered as the quintessential dish that represents an Indonesian family. It is in the menu, introduced, offered, and served in Indonesian Theater Restaurant within the Indonesian pavilion at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]. [[Howard P. Jones|Howard Palfrey Jones]], the US ambassador to Indonesia during the last years of [[Sukarno]]'s reign in the mid-1960s, in his memoir "Indonesia: The Possible Dream", said that he liked ''nasi goreng''. He described his fondness for ''nasi goreng'' cooked by Hartini, one of Sukarno's wives, and praised it as the most delicious ''nasi goreng'' he ever tasted.<ref name="Historia-NG"/>

In 2018, ''nasi goreng'' was officially recognized by the Indonesian government as one of the country's [[Indonesian cuisine#National dishes|national dishes along with four others]]: [[Soto (food)|soto]], ''[[Satay|sate]]'', [[rendang]], and [[gado-gado]].<ref name="Kompas.com-Makanan-Nasional"/>

In [[Politics of Indonesia|Indonesian politics]] parlance, ''nasi goreng'' is colloquially known as a dish served for [[lobbying]] or diplomacy among Indonesian politicians. Known as ''diplomasi nasi goreng'' (''nasi goreng'' diplomacy) or ''politik nasi goreng'' (''nasi goreng'' politics), the term was popularised by [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]] that entertain [[Prabowo Subianto]] and served him ''nasi goreng'' back in July 2019.

During the 20th century, ''nasi goreng'' expanded beyond its role as a household and street food to become one of the most recognisable dishes of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. Across the region it developed numerous distinctive variants: in Indonesia and Malaysia it was promoted as a [[national dish]] with countless local styles;<ref name="Promoting nasi goreng as Indonesian cultural heritage: Harmony in taste, history and tourism aspects">{{Cite web|title=Promoting nasi goreng as Indonesian cultural heritage: Harmony in taste, history and tourism aspects|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387825895_Promoting_nasi_goreng_as_Indonesian_cultural_heritage_Harmony_in_taste_history_and_tourism_aspects|access-date=21 September 2025}}</ref><ref name="Objek Warisan Tidak Ketara"/> in Singapore it entered [[Hawker centre|hawker culture]], shaped by Malay, Indian Muslim and Chinese influences;<ref name="The History and Evolution of Singapore's Hawker Culture">{{Cite web|title=The History and Evolution of Singapore's Hawker Culture|url=https://www.roots.gov.sg/stories-landing/stories/Serving-Up-a-Legacy|access-date=21 September 2025}}</ref> while in Brunei and southern Thailand it was prepared with regional ingredients such as seafood, [[Sambal|sambal belacan]] and local chilli pastes.

As global interest in Asian cuisines grew in the early 21st century, ''nasi goreng'' emerged in food surveys and culinary publications as a prominent regional dish. It has also been featured in tourism promotion by Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, where it is presented as part of national food heritage. Beyond its regional diversity, nasi goreng has come to be regarded as one of the defining rice dishes of Southeast Asia.

== Culinary profile ==
''Nasi goreng'' is distinguished from other Asian fried rice recipes by its aromatic, earthy and smoky flavour.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.femina.in/life/travel/travel-with-food-nasi-goreng-83223.html|title=Travel with food: Indonesia with Nasi Goreng|work=femina.in|access-date=23 July 2018}}</ref> ''Nasi goreng'' is traditionally served at home for breakfast and it is traditionally made out of leftover rice from the night before. The texture of leftover cooked rice is considered more suitable for ''nasi goreng'' than that of freshly cooked rice which may be too moist and soft to withstand frying in a wok.

Other than cooked rice, ''nasi goreng'' consists of at least three components; ingredients (e.g. egg, shrimp, meat, cooking oil), ''[[Bumbu (seasoning)|bumbu]]'' spice or seasoning (e.g. garlic, shallot, salt, chili pepper) and condiments (e.g. ''[[bawang goreng]]'', [[krupuk]], ''[[acar]]'' pickles, slices of fresh cucumber and tomato). The combination of spices and ingredients in different ratios allows for the creation of a myriad of  flavours.<ref name="Kompas.id-nasi goreng 1">{{Cite web|date=2021-11-03|title=Kelenturan Cita Rasa Nasi Goreng Nusantara|url=https://interaktif.kompas.id/baca/kelenturan-cita-rasa-nasi-goreng-nusantara/|access-date=2021-11-04|website=Tutur Visual Kompas.id|language=id}}</ref>

=== Spice and seasonings ===

Typical seasonings for ''nasi goreng'' include but are not limited to salt, [[chilli pepper]], [[spring onion]]s, [[turmeric]], [[palm sugar]], [[Bumbu (seasoning)#Basic bumbu|''bumbu'' paste made from ground garlic and onion or shallot]], ''[[kecap manis]]'' (sweet soy sauce), shrimp paste, [[black pepper]], [[fish sauce]], powdered broth and so on. [[egg (food)|Eggs]] may be scrambled into the rice during the cooking process, or served as accompaniments in the form of [[fried egg|sunny side up eggs]], [[omelette]]s and boiled eggs. Scraps of leftovers from a prepared dish, perhaps chicken or beef pieces, may also be used.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/11/14/by-way-a-tale-%E2%80%98nasi-goreng%E2%80%99-%E2%80%94-leftover-rice-and-chicken-scraps.html |title=By the way ...

=== Condiments ===
''Nasi goreng'' often adds condiments or garnishes as add-ons. Fried shallot and traditional crackers are often sprinkled upon to give crispy texture, slices of [[cucumber]] and tomato for garnishing and to give freshness in an otherwise oily dish, a fried [[Egg as food|egg]] is often placed on top of the dish to add savouriness, while chili paste is to add the zesty spiciness according to one's preference. Some common condiments are:
*''[[Bawang goreng]]'': [[Deep frying|Deep-fried]] [[shallot]]s, sprinkled upon ''nasi goreng''
*''[[Kerupuk]]'': various types of crackers, usually ''[[emping]]'' or [[prawn cracker]]s
*''[[Acar]]'': [[Pickled cucumber|pickles]] made from vinegar preserved cucumber, shallots, carrot and small chilli peppers.
*''[[Fried egg|Telur]]'': egg; can be cooked in many ways and placed on the nasi goreng, usually sunny-side up fried or [[omelette]].
*''[[Sambal]]'': chilli sauce.

There is no single defined recipe for ''nasi goreng'', as every fried rice dish with certain mixtures, additions, ingredients and toppings could lead to another recipe of ''nasi goreng''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jo|first1=Andru|title=The Indonesians' nasi goreng recipes|url=https://asianinspirations.com.au/recipe/stir-fried-nasi-goreng-noodle/|access-date=17 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130125644/https://asianinspirations.com.au/recipe/stir-fried-nasi-goreng-noodle/|archive-date=30 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> There is an innumerable variety of fried rice recipes described as ''nasi goreng'' in the nations of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. While many versions are perceived as regionally specific, some recipes share common elements that transcends regional and national boundaries: examples include the use of the term ''kampung'' ("village" in Indonesian and Malay), shrimp paste (''terasi'' in Indonesian, ''belacan'' in Malay), chilli-based ''[[sambal]]'' relishes, [[salted fish]] and the technique of wrapping fried rice in an omelette.

=== Indonesia ===
According to Dwi Larasatie, an Indonesian culinary expert from the [[Gadjah Mada University]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Pakar Kuliner UGM Sebut Indonesia Punya 104 Jenis Nasi Goreng |date=16 July 2021 |url=https://ugm.ac.id/id/berita/21391-pakar-kuliner-ugm-sebut-indonesia-punya-104-jenis-nasi-goreng}}</ref> there are 104 types of ''nasi goreng'' found throughout Indonesia.<ref name="KompasTV">{{Cite web |title=Mengejutkan, Ada 104 Jenis Nasi Goreng di Indonesia |url=https://www.kompas.tv/kuliner/193263/mengejutkan-ada-104-jenis-nasi-goreng-di-indonesia |date=16 July 2021|access-date=2024-11-05 |website=Kompas.tv |language=id}}</ref> All of them are different because they have special spices that characterise the region. Of that 104 ''nasi goreng'' variants are classified into three groups; ''nasi goreng'' whose origins can be clearly known (36 types), then some developed ''nasi goreng'' because it cannot be traced to the area of origin (59 types). Java has 20 variants of ''nasi goreng'' spread from the west to the east. For example, ''nasi goreng Betawi'', ''nasi goreng Sunda'', ''nasi goreng Jawa'', ''nasi goreng'' Semarangan, ''nasi goreng Jawa Timuran'', etc.<ref name="KompasTV"/> There are 9 types of ''nasi goreng'' whose basic ingredients are not only rice, but also contains additional mixture such as noodles, barley, corn, etc.<ref>{{Cite web |author=Prihardani Ganda Tuah Purba |title=Nasi Goreng Indonesia Istimewa karena Beraneka Ragam|date=2021-08-17 |url=https://www.dw.com/id/nasi-goreng-indonesia-istimewa-karena-beraneka-ragam/a-58882372 |access-date=2022-09-23 |website=dw.com |language=id}}</ref>

In most parts of Indonesia, ''nasi goreng'' is cooked with ample amounts of ''[[kecap manis]]'' (sweet soy sauce) that creates a golden brownish colour and the flavour is mildly sweet.<ref name="Chesman"/> A typical preparation of ''nasi goreng'' may involve [[stir frying]] rice in a small amount of [[cooking oil]] or [[margarine]]; seasoned with an ample amount of ''kecap manis'' and ground [[shrimp paste]] and cooked with other ingredients, particularly eggs and [[Chicken as food|chicken]]. However, in other places such as Eastern Indonesia ([[Sulawesi]] and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]]), the sweet soy sauce is usually absent and is replaced by bottled tomato and chili sauce, creating reddish-coloured ''nasi goreng''. This variant is called ''nasi goreng merah'' (red fried rice) or ''nasi goreng Makassar'' after the [[Makassar|South Sulawesi capital]]. Some variants of ''nasi goreng'', such as salted fish or ''teri Medan'' ([[Medan]]'s [[Anchovies as food|anchovy]]) ''nasi goreng'', do not use ''kecap manis'' at all, creating a lighter colour similar to Chinese fried rice or Japanese ''[[Chahan (food)|chahan]]''.

The basic ingredients of ''nasi goreng'' are rice and sliced or ground ''[[Bumbu (seasoning)|bumbu]]'' (spices) mixture of [[shallot]], garlic, pepper, salt, tomato ketchup, [[sambal]] or chili sauce and usually sweet soy sauce. Some variants may add ''saus tiram'' ([[oyster sauce]]), ''ang-ciu'' (Chinese cooking red wine), ''kecap ikan'' ([[fish sauce]]), or ''kecap inggris'' (like [[Worcestershire sauce]]). Typically in Indonesian households, the ingredients of ''nasi goreng'' prepared for daily breakfast consist of leftovers of the previous day's meals preserved in the refrigerator, with fresh vegetables and eggs added.

Indonesians also called foreign versions of fried rice simply as ''nasi goreng'', thus ''nasi goreng Hongkong'' and ''nasi goreng Tionghoa/China'' refer to Chinese fried rice, while ''nasi goreng Jepang'' refer to ''yakimeshi'' or ''chahan''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://travel.kompas.com/read/2017/10/20/070500027/mencicipi-yakimeshi-nasi-goreng-khas-jepang|title=Mencicipi Yakimeshi, Nasi Goreng Khas Jepang |last=Media|first=Kompas Cyber|date=20 October 2017|work=KOMPAS.com|access-date=23 July 2018|language=id}}</ref>

=== Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and southern Thailand ===
[[File:Nasi Goreng Kampung Malaysia.jpg|thumb|180px|A plate of ''nasi goreng kampung'', one of the popular renditions of nasi goreng in Malaysia]]
''Nasi goreng'' is firmly embedded in the food cultures of Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and southern Thailand, where it is sold in roadside stalls, [[mamak stall|mamak eateries]], [[Kopitiam|kopitiams]] and restaurants, as well as being a common household meal. Preparations typically use pre-cooked rice stir-fried with soy sauce, shallots, garlic and chilli, with additions such as egg, chicken, seafood, or vegetables. The use of [[Shrimp paste|belacan]] (fermented shrimp paste) is a distinctive feature of many regional versions.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Planet | first1=L. | last2=de Jong | first2=R. | title=Lonely Planet Singapore | publisher=Lonely Planet Global Limited | series=Travel Guide | year=2018 | isbn=978-1-78701-238-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=981RDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT60 | access-date=25 June 2018 | page=60}}</ref>

A wide range of variants is documented in Malaysia. ''Nasi goreng kampung'', prepared with anchovies and water spinach, and ''nasi goreng belacan'', seasoned with shrimp paste, are longstanding favourites. Other examples include nasi goreng kunyit with turmeric, [[Nasi goreng pattaya|nasi goreng Pattaya]] wrapped in an [[omelette]] and ''nasi goreng USA'', combining chicken, prawns and squid.<ref name="25 Jenis Nasi Goreng Yang Popular dan Digemari Ramai">{{citation|date=20 January 2021|title=25 Jenis Nasi Goreng Yang Popular dan Digemari Ramai|url=https://saji.my/jenis-nasi-goreng/|work=Saji|language=Malay|access-date=2024-11-02}}</ref><ref name="20 Variasi Nasi Goreng yang Rakyat Malaysia Mesti Tahu">{{citation|date=2019|title=20 Variasi Nasi Goreng yang Rakyat Malaysia Mesti Tahu

Across the region, local adaptations reflect the versatility of the dish. Singaporean [[Hawker centre|hawker centres]] feature sambal-based recipes from Malay vendors, spicier preparations served with fried meats or curries from Indian Muslim stalls and soy-sauce-based styles from Chinese stalls. In Brunei, notable forms include ''nasi goreng belutak'', made with a traditional beef sausage, ''nasi goreng pulau Brunei'' (“floating fried rice”) and adaptations using corned beef or seasonal fruits such as [[Canarium odontophyllum|buah dabai]] (Borneo olive). In southern Thailand, particularly in the Malay-speaking provinces of [[Pattani province|Pattani]], [[Yala province|Yala]] and [[Narathiwat]], ''nasi goreng'' is integrated into [[Thai Malays|local Malay food traditions]], typically prepared with stronger spices and often served with accompaniments such as fried chicken, cucumber or pickled vegetables.

=== Sri Lanka ===
[[File:Nasigroni Rice.JPG|thumb|[[Sri Lankan cuisine|Sri Lankan]] ''nasi goreng'' served with a fried egg]]
''Nasi goreng'' ({{langx|si|නාසි ගොරේන්}}) is adopted into [[Sri Lankan cuisine]] through cultural influences from the [[Sri Lankan Malays]].<ref name="Sri Lanka">{{cite web |url=https://roar.media/sinhala/main/health-lifestyle/sri-lankan-food-culture/ |title=ශ්‍රී ලාංකික ආහාර සංස්කෘතිය වර්ණවත් කළ පෙර අපර දෙදිග රජබොජුන්

=== Suriname ===
''Nasi goreng'' is a popular fried rice dish in [[Suriname]], influenced by [[Javanese cuisine|Javanese culinary traditions]]. In Surinamese context, the term ''"nasi"'' alone often refers to fried rice dishes, differing from Indonesia, where ''"nasi goreng"'' specifically means fried rice.<ref name="Surinamese Nasi (Basic Recipe)">{{citation|date=17 December 2019|title=Surinamese Nasi (Basic Recipe)

[[File:Nasi Goreng Trafasie.JPG|thumb|left|Surinamese nasi]]
Surinamese nasi is typically served with a mix of meats, such as ''moksi meti'' (a combination of [[Roasting|roasted meats]]) or roasted chicken, which originates from [[Chinese Surinamese|Chinese-Surinamese cuisine]]. It is often garnished with strips of fried [[Omelette|egg omelet]] and accompanied by sides such as ''atjar'' ([[acar|pickled vegetables]])<ref name="Zuurgoed - Surinaamse Atjar">{{citation|date=2009|title=Zuurgoed - Surinaamse Atjar|url=https://www.sorghenhoop.nl/recepten/creoolse-recepten-specerijenpasta/539873_zuurgoed-surinaamse-atjar|work=sorghenhoop.com|access-date=2024-11-05}}</ref> and ''bakabana'' ([[fried plantain]]).<ref name="Surinamese Nasi (Basic Recipe)"/> Unlike the Indonesian version, where fried rice is commonly cooked together with the meat, in Suriname, the meat is typically prepared separately and added to complement the meal.<ref name="Nasi Goreng (Surinamese)">{{citation|date=2009|title=Nasi Goreng (Surinamese)

The dish exemplifies a fusion of cultural influences resulting from the historical migration of [[Javanese Surinamese|Javanese people to Suriname]] during the [[Surinam (Dutch colony)|Dutch colonial period]], who introduced their culinary traditions.<ref name="The Hirshon Suriname Fried Rice – Nasi Goreng">{{citation|date=2020|title=The Hirshon Suriname Fried Rice – Nasi Goreng

For example, soy sauce is often used to enhance the flavor and color of the rice, although some recipes may replace it with tomato paste. This adaptability in preparation allows for diverse variations that reflect personal or regional preferences.

In the Netherlands, Indonesian cuisine is common due to the historical [[Dutch East Indies|colonial ties with Indonesia]]. [[Indo people|Indo-Dutch]] and [[Indonesians]] cater Indonesian food both in restaurants and as take-away. Also, take-away versions of ''nasi goreng''<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-05-12 |title=Rahasia Nasi Goreng Yang Sempurna: Teknik Dan Bahan Yang Digunakan - Brackto |url=https://brackto.com/nasi-goreng/ |access-date=2025-05-12 |language=en-US}}</ref> are plentiful in ''[[Toko (shop)|toko]]'' Asian grocery shop and supermarkets.<ref name="Scheerstra"/> Supermarkets also commonly carry several brands of spice mix for ''nasi goreng'', along with ''krupuk'' and other Indonesian cooking supplies.

Chinese take-aways and restaurants have also adapted ''nasi goreng'', plus a selection of other Indonesian dishes, but spice them Cantonese style. In [[Flanders]], the name ''nasi goreng'' is often used for any Asian style of fried rice. Distinctive version of ''nasi goreng'' has been developed, such as Javanese-Suriname version of the dish.<ref name="Tropilab"/> In the Netherlands, ''nasi goreng'' has been developed into a snack called ''[[nasischijf]]'' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]] for "nasi disk"), it is a Dutch deep-fried fast food, consisting of ''nasi goreng'' inside a crust of breadcrumbs.

A typical type of ''nasi goreng'', created in the Dutch Indies by [[Indo people|Indo-Dutch]] or [[Dutch people|Dutch]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mevrouw in de keuken : Hollandsch-Indisch kookboek : 245 beproefde recepten {{!}} WorldCat.org |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/65789665 |access-date=2022-12-06 |website=www.worldcat.org |language=en}}</ref> and still eaten in The Netherlands today is made with butter and bacon or other types of pork at its base.

===Street food=== 
''Nasi goreng'' is a popular staple served by [[street vendor]]s, in ''[[warung]]s'' and also by travelling night hawkers that frequent residential neighbourhoods with their wheeled carts.<ref name="Street Food Around the World"/> When accompanied by a fried egg, it is sometimes called ''nasi goreng istimewa'' (special fried rice).<ref>{{cite web|title=Nasi Goreng Istimewa (Fried Rice Indonesian Style)|author=Eileen Yin-Fei Lo |website=New York Times Cooking|url=http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/3589-nasi-goreng-istimewa-fried-rice-indonesian-style|access-date=3 August 2015}}</ref> ''Nasi goreng'' is usually cooked to order for each serving, since the cook usually asks the client their preference on the degree of spiciness: mild, medium, hot or extra hot. The spiciness corresponds to the amount of ''[[sambal]]'' or chili pepper paste used. The cook might also ask how the client would like their egg done: mixed into nasi goreng or fried separately as ''telur mata sapi'' or ''ceplok'' (fried whole egg) or as ''telur dadar'' ([[omelette]]). Nevertheless, some popular ''nasi goreng'' ''warung'' or food stalls may prepare in bulk due to large demand.

In many ''warungs'' (street stalls) in Indonesia, ''nasi goreng'' is often sold together with ''[[mie goreng|bakmi goreng]]'' (fried noodles), ''[[kwetiau goreng]]'' and ''[[mie rebus]]'' (noodle soup).
