'''Fanesca''' is a [[soup]] traditionally prepared only on [[Good Friday]] and is eaten by households and communities in [[Ecuador]]. This dish is an Ecuadorian tradition that is prepared to give thanks to God for the food provided and blessings.

== History ==
The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] people who occupied the territory of [https://www-atozworldculture-com.eznvcc.vccs.edu/ecuador/cultural-overview.html Ecuador] celebrated the [https://www.alternatives.org.uk/event/mushuk-nina-shamanic-healing-sacred-fire Muchuc Nina] (New Fire Day) in the season that corresponds to March, where they grilled tender grains with Andean [[pumpkin]]s taking advantage of the beginning of the young harvest. The Mushuc Nina was celebrated to commemorate the [https://www.weather.gov/cle/Seasons equinox solstice], when the sun takes a perpendicular position on the equinoctial line, erasing all shadows.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Loiza |first=Yalilé |date=April 16, 2022 |title=La historia de la fanes la sopa ecuatoriana que recuerda a Jesus y sus apóstoles |url=https://www.infobae.com/america/america-latina/2022/04/16/la-historia-de-la-fanesca-la-sopa-ecuatoriana-que-recuerda-a-jesus-y-sus-apostoles/ |website=Infobae}}</ref> The indigenous people prepared for this festival by fasting and abstaining from sexual activity. The indigenous people's culinary preparation with tender grains and Andean pumpkins on New Fire Day became known as Uchucuta, a [[Kichwa language|Quichua]] phrase that means tender grains cooked with chili and herbs, probably accompanied by wild guinea pig meat.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sempértegui |first=Brenda |date=July 4, 2022 |title=Conexion PUCE |url=https://conexion.puce.edu.ec/fanesca-una-deliciosa-tradicion-de-semana-santa}}</ref> During the colony's evangelizing period,<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Lucero |first=Jose Antonio |date=May 10, 2005 |title=Representing "Real Indians": The Challenges of Indigenous Authenticity and Strategic Constructivism in Ecuador and Bolivia |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3874668 |journal=Latin American Research Review|volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=31–56 |doi=10.1353/lar.2006.0026 |jstor=3874668 |s2cid=144278780 |url-access=subscription }}</ref> the [[Spaniards]] mixed Catholic symbols and beliefs with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] components in order to accomplish cultural miscegenation. In the case of Holy Week, the Spaniards combined the commemoration of Jesus Christ's death, passion, and resurrection with the indigenous Muchuc Nina ritual, creating a preparation based on tender grains, which with the influence of the conquerors includes this stew some grains, dairy products, and salted and [[dried fish]] to avoid decomposition. The Spaniards add [[bean]]s, [[lentil]]s, and [[pea]]s into the gastronomic portion, which strengthens trade between the mountains and the shore, allowing products such as [[banana]]s, peanuts, and fish to be found in mountain areas, aspects that are part of the Fanesca.

By the 19th century [[Quito]] was already celebrating Holy Week with the dish technically known as Fanesca, which would become an essential component of the event. The oldest reference to a Fanesca recipe could be from 1882, described by Juan Pablo Sanz in his book "The Cook's Manual"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sanz |first=Juan Pablo |title=Memorias del VI Congreso de Cocinas Regionales Andinas.

Currently, Fanesca is most popular in the northern highlands of Ecuador. Its popularity decreases to the south and the Coastal region. The Manabí province is where Fanesca is less important.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Duarte-Casar |first1=Rodrigo |last2=Rojas-Le-Fort |first2=Marlene |date=2024-04-18 |title=Fanesca: patrones y tendencias de veinte años de búsquedas en Internet |url=https://academiaculinaria.org/index.php/gastronomia-cocina/article/view/46 |journal=Revista de Gastronomía y Cocina |language=es |volume=3 |issue=EE1 |pages=2 |doi=10.5281/zenodo.10993267 |issn=2953-6480}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Rojas-Le-Fort |first1=Marlene |last2=Valdivieso-López |first2=Isabel Patricia |last3=Duarte-Casar |first3=Rodrigo |date=2023-11-13 |title=Representations of Ecuadorian cuisine in the coast and the highlands regions through the free listing technique |journal=Discover Food |language=en |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=20 |doi=10.1007/s44187-023-00061-9 |issn=2731-4286|doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Ingredients and preparation==
The components of fanesca and its method of preparation vary regionally, or even from one family to another. It is typically prepared and served only in the week before Easter ([[Holy Week]]).  Making the soup is labor-intensive.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Morales |first=Christina |date=21 March 2024 |title=A Lenten Soup So Good the Memory of It Lasts a Whole Year |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/21/dining/fanesca-lenten-soup.html |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

It is a rich soup with primary ingredients [[Cucurbita ficifolia|figleaf gourd]] (''sambo''), [[pumpkin]] (''zapallo''), and twelve different kinds of beans and grains including ''chochos'' (lupines), fava beans (''habas''), lentils, peas, corn, and others, together with [[salt cod]] (''bacalao'') cooked in milk, due to the Catholic religious prohibition against [[red meat]] during Holy Week. It is also generally garnished with hard-boiled eggs, fried [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], herbs, parsley, and sometimes ''empanadas de viento'' (Ecuadorian fried cheese empanadas).

==Cultural themes and consumption==
The twelve beans represent the [[twelve apostles]] of [[Jesus]], and the bacalao is symbolic of Jesus himself.

Fanesca is usually consumed at midday, which is generally the principal meal of the day within Ecuadorian culture.  The making and eating of fanesca are considered a social or family activity.

* '''Choclo''': It symbolizes [[Saint Peter|St. Peter]] because the number of grains of an ear gives faith in the children and grandchildren he had. The hair represents his beard.
* '''Chochos''': They must be purified for seven days. This saint is [[Judas Iscariot]], who only washed can be part of the soup.
* '''Peas''': Green pearls that represent San Antonio, the love of nature and farming. "Feed the body so that the soul has peace."
* '''Beans''': Grains of dominant flavor par excellence and of great identity. She represents [[Mary Magdalene]], for being the companion of the mother (Loiza) of Jesus.
* '''Zapallo''': For his abundant food he represents [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis of Assisi]], who abandoned his kingdom and fortune to follow God.
* '''Frijole:''' The three frijoles represent the [[Magi]], who brought gold, myrrh, and incense to Bethlehem.
* '''Cod''': It represents the multiplication of fish. He is the guest you can't miss. It is Jesus, who sends back the sense of sharing.
* '''Onion''': They represent the braids of the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]]. For causing tears, they refer to the tears shed.
* '''Milk and derivatives''': [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], the most balanced saint, purifies relationships and harmonizes flavor and aroma.
* '''Aromatic herbs''': Cilantro and oregano are Fray [[Martin de Porres|Martín de Porres]], the only black saint, who healed with herbs and roots.
* '''The fries''': They are added at the end and represent political relatives, who can avoid whether you want to or not, as with some visits.
