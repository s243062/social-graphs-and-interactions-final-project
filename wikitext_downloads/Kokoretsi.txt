'''Kokoretsi''' ({{Langx|el|κοκορέτσι}}) or '''kokoreç''' is a dish of the [[Balkan cuisine|Balkans]] and [[Anatolia|Anatolia (Asia Minor)]], consisting of [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] or [[Goat meat|goat]] [[gut (anatomy)|intestines]] wrapped around seasoned [[offal]], including [[sweetbread]]s, [[Heart#Food|heart]]s, [[lung]]s, or [[Kidney (food)|kidney]]s, and typically grilled; a variant consists of chopped innards cooked on a [[griddle]]. The intestines of suckling lambs are preferred.

According to Greek linguist and philologist [[Georgios Babiniotis]], the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|el|κοκορέτσι}} (''kokorétsi'') comes from [[Albanian language|Albanian]] {{lang|sq|kukurec}}.<ref name=":3" /> According to [[Armenians in Turkey|Turkish Armenian]] linguist [[Sevan Nişanyan]], Albanian {{lang|sq|kukurec}} is a [[loanword]] derived from [[Serbo-Croatian]] and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ''kukuruza'', originally meaning [[corncob]] in these languages.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Nişanyan|first=Sevan|author-link=Sevan Nişanyan|date=2002|title=kokoreç|url=http://nisanyansozluk.com/?k=kokore%C3%A7|access-date=2020-02-24|website=Nişanyan Sözlük – Çağdaş Türkçenin Etimolojisi}}</ref> Nişanyan also asserts that the Greek word is not derived from the Albanian {{lang|sq|kukurec}}, but both words are [[cognate]]s that were loaned from [[South Slavic languages]] independently.<ref name=":1" /> The [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] name is {{lang|rup|cucureci}}.<ref name="aro">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T0YLAQAAIAAJ|title=Dacoromania: buletinul "Muzeului Limbei Române", Volume 4|publisher=Editura Institutului de Arte Grafice "Ardealul"|year=1927|page=955|language=ro}}</ref>

The [[Turkish language|Turkish]] word {{lang|tr|kokoreç}} was first attested in ''Lokanta Esrarı''; a short story written in 1920 by the Turkish author [[Ömer Seyfettin]]. The author wrote that the first time he heard of {{lang|tr|kokoreç}}, was when it was presented to him as a specialty of an [[Athens|Athenian]] who worked in an [[Istanbul]] restaurant; it was described as a Greek dish made from small lamb intestines.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Mert|first=Necati|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7h9kAAAAMAAJ|title=Ömer Seyfettin: İslamcı Milliyetçi ve Modernist Bir Yazar|publisher=Kaknüs Yayinlari|year=2004|isbn=978-9756698884|page=437|language=tr|quote=Mihail, kokoreç müjdesi verir anlatıcıya: "Kozmos'tan bir aşçı çırağı kaçırdık, şimdi bize geldi.

==Preparation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2022}}
The offal, along with some fat, is washed and cut into ½ to ¾-inch thick pieces, and lightly seasoned with [[lemon]], [[olive oil]], [[oregano]], [[Edible salt|salt]], [[Black pepper|pepper]], and sometimes garlic. The intestine is turned inside out and carefully washed, then rubbed with salt and often soaked in vinegar or lemon juice and water.

The filling meats are threaded onto a long [[skewer]] and wrapped with the intestine to hold them together, forming a compact roll usually about 16–24 inches long by 1½–3 inches in diameter.

Kokoretsi is usually roasted on a [[rotisserie|horizontal skewer]] over a charcoal, gas, or electrical burner, and may be basted with lemon juice and olive oil.

A quite different preparation mixes the chopped innards with chopped tomatoes and green peppers, and then cooks them on a large [[griddle]] with hot red pepper and oregano added. The cook constantly mixes and chops the mixture using two [[spatula]]s. When done, the dish is kept warm aside on the griddle until someone orders a serving.

==Serving==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2022}}
The cooked kokoretsi is chopped or sliced, sprinkled with [[oregano]], and served on a plate. Sometimes it is served on a piece of [[pita|flatbread]]. Some add [[tomato]]es or spices in it. It may also (especially in Turkey) be served in half a baguette or in a sandwich bun, plain or garnished, almost always with oregano and red pepper. In Turkey, common side dishes are pickled peppers or cucumbers. It is often seasoned with lemon, oregano, salt, a pepper, and typically accompanied by wine or [[rakı]].

==National and regional variations==

===Byzantine Empire and Greece===
[[File:Traditional Greek Easter lamb and Kokoretsi.jpg|thumb|Kokoretsi being roasted with lamb during Greek Orthodox [[Easter]] celebrations]]
The Byzantines treated the small intestines of sheep and goats the same way as modern Greeks do when making kokoretsi.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":2" /> Through a simple process, the intestines were inverted with the help of a small stick in order to be cleaned. They were then wrapped in [[braid]]s, in the appropriate shape, or around other entrails on a skewer.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":2" />

In modern times, kokoretsi is traditionally served for Orthodox [[Easter]] celebrations; eaten as an appetizer while the lamb (being the main dish) is roasting.<ref>Vilma Chantiles, ''Food of Greece: Cooking, Folkways, and Travel in the Mainland and Islands of Greece'', 1992, {{isbn|0671750968}}, p. 165</ref> It is also served year-round.<ref>Jonathan Deutsch, Natalya Murakhver, ''They Eat That?: A Cultural Encyclopedia of Weird and Exotic Food from Around the World'', 2012, {{isbn|0313380589}}, p. 125</ref> Gardouba (γαρδούμπα) or gardoubakia (γαρδουμπάκια) is a smaller version of kokoretsi; it may be grilled like kokoretsi, roasted in a pan, or cooked in the oven.

Due to outbreak of [[mad cow]] disease in the late '90s, banning the consumption of offal was considered.<ref>Michael Herzfeld, "The European Self", in Anthony Pagden, ed., ''The Idea of Europe'', 2002, {{isbn|0521791715}}, p. 162</ref> However, the idea was abandoned.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Turkey===
[[File:Kokoreç (6377122133).jpg|thumb|Turkish {{lang|tr|kokoreççi}} (kokoretsi maker) in [[Fatih]], İstanbul]]
Kokoretsi is one of the most consumed fast foods in Turkey,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fethiyetimes.com/eat/24204-24204.html|title=Street Food: Kokoreç – a delicacy for offal lovers|last=Ward|first=Lyn|date=2017-12-01|website=Fethiye Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-09-23|archive-date=2020-11-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201126093357/https://www.fethiyetimes.com/eat/24204-24204.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> being described as "the signature delight" of the country.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Thorne|first1=John|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xZdrKwSZse0C&q=kokore%C3%A7+turkey+signature&pg=PT112|title=Mouth Wide Open: A Cook and His Appetite|last2=Thorne|first2=Matt Lewis|date=2008-11-25|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-1-4668-0646-7|language=en}}</ref> Although it is also served in some restaurants, most of the kokoretsi is prepared, cooked and sold in small [[Kiosk|kiosks]] year-round, and is usually consumed as a sandwich. Kokoretsi makers are called {{lang|tr|kokoreççi}} in Turkish.

In the early 2000s, during the [[Turkish accession|Turkish accession to the European Union]] it has been speculated by the Turkish media that EU regulations regarding sheep's offal would eventually lead to a ban on kokoretsi, if Turkey ever become a member state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sabah.com.tr/dunya/2009/10/21/kokorec_almanyada|title=Kokoreç Almanya'da|website=Sabah|language=tr|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref><ref name=":0" />
