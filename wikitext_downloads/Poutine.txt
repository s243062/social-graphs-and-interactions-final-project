'''Poutine'''{{efn|{{IPA|fr-CA|puˈt͡sɪn||Qc-Poutine.ogg|label=[[Quebec French]]:}}}} <!-- do not add Canadian or Québécois here - see past discussions and FAQ at top of talk page --> is a dish of [[french fries|French fries]] and [[cheese curd]]s topped with a hot brown beef and chicken stock [[gravy]]. It emerged in the [[Centre-du-Québec]] region of [[Quebec]] in the late 1950s, though its exact origins are uncertain, and there are several competing claims regarding its origin. For many years, it was used by some to mock [[Culture of Quebec|Quebec society]].<ref name="poutinedynamics"/> Poutine later became celebrated as a symbol of [[Québécois people|Québécois]] culture and the province of Quebec. It has long been associated with [[cuisine of Quebec|Quebec cuisine]], and its rise in prominence has led to its growing popularity throughout the rest of [[Canada]].

Annual poutine celebrations occur in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec City]], and [[Drummondville]], as well as [[Toronto]], [[Ottawa]], [[New Hampshire]], and [[Chicago]]. It has been called [[Canadian cuisine#National food of Canada|Canada's national dish]], though some critics believe this labeling represents [[cultural appropriation]] of the Québécois or Quebec's provincial identity.<ref name="poutinedynamics"/><ref name="DeSoucey2020"/>  Many variations on the original recipe are popular, leading some to suggest that poutine has emerged as a new dish classification in its own right, as with [[sandwich]]es or [[dumpling]]s.<ref name="poutinedynamics"/>

According to Canadian food researcher [[Sylvain Charlebois]], while [[Warwick, Quebec|Warwick]] is the birthplace of poutine, [[Drummondville]]'s Jean-Paul Roy is the true inventor since Le Roy Jucep was the first to sell poutine with three combined ingredients, in 1964.<ref>{{cite book |title=Poutine nation: la glorieuse ascension d'un plat sans prétention |trans-title=Poutine Nation: the glorious rise of an unpretentious dish |first=Sylvain |last=Charlebois |authorlink=Sylvain Charlebois |year=2021 |publisher=Fides |location=Montreal, Quebec |isbn=978-2-76-214412-3 |language=fr |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X7J8zgEACAAJ |access-date=12 October 2022 |archive-date=17 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231017191841/https://books.google.com/books?id=X7J8zgEACAAJ |url-status=live }}</ref> ''The Oxford Companion to Cheese'' takes a different perspective, stating that the inventors were not chefs but the customers who chose to add cheese curds to their fries.<ref name="OxfordCompanion" />

===Development===
Poutine was consumed in small "[[greasy spoon]]" [[diner]]s (commonly known in Quebec as {{lang|fr|cantines}} or {{lang|fr|casse-croûtes}}), [[pub]]s, at roadside chip wagons (commonly known as {{lang|fr|cabanes à patates}}, literally "potato shacks"), and in ice hockey arenas.<ref name="poutinedynamics" /> For decades, it remained a country snack food in Quebec's dairy region, due to the narrow freshness window of [[cheddar cheese]] curds.<ref name="WoodsTreasure" /><ref name="GollnerBest"/> In 1969, poutine was brought to Quebec City in Ashton Leblond's [[food truck]] (a business which grew into the [[Chez Ashton]] fast-food chain).<ref name="CDNE">{{Cite web |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/history-of-poutine |title=Poutine |last=Arfonovitch |first=Davida |website=thecanadianencyclo[edia.ca |access-date=28 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423095738/https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/history-of-poutine |archive-date=23 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the early 1970s, [[La Banquise]] began serving poutine in Montreal,<ref name="SemenakBanquise" /> followed by the [[Burger King]] chain in 1983.

Montreal chefs would make poutine to feed their staff but had not dared to put it on their menus. In the 1990s, attempts were made to elevate the dish by using [[baked potato]]es and duck [[Stock (food)|stock]]. In November&nbsp;2001, [[Martin Picard]] of bistro [[Au Pied de Cochon]] began serving a [[foie gras]] poutine which was praised by customers and food critics.<ref name="KraussPride" /> This influenced chefs in Toronto and Vancouver to feature poutine on upscale menus.<ref name="ChestermanMontreal"/> Chef [[Mark McEwan]] served lobster poutine at his Bymark eatery, and chef [[Jamie Kennedy (chef)|Jamie Kennedy]] served [[braising|braised]] beef poutine at his eponymous restaurant.<ref name="KatesReview" /> Over the next decade, poutine gained acceptance and popularity in all types of restaurants, from [[haute cuisine]] to fast food, and spread across Canada and internationally.<ref name="poutinedynamics" /> Poutine became extremely trendy in the early 2010s, with an explosion of poutineries in cities like Toronto, leading to stories about poutine's association with romance<ref>{{Cite web |last=Reporter |first=Stephanie Findlay Staff |date=2012-09-02 |title=Poutine shops serve up side of passion |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/poutine-shops-serve-up-side-of-passion/article_b2c49b5c-d7ba-58aa-a1a5-a5d5ea44857c.html |access-date=2024-11-17 |website=Toronto Star |language=en}}</ref> and events like the [[IBM Watson]] Cognitive Cooking Poutine Event, where the computer generated unique poutine recipes based on the demographics of Toronto and Montreal.<ref name="Pelley2015"/>

===Etymology===
The ''[[Dictionnaire historique du français québécois]]'' lists 15 meanings of {{lang|fr|poutine}} in [[Quebec French|Québécois]] and [[Acadian French]], most of which are for kinds of food; the word ''poutine'' in the meaning "fries with cheese and gravy" is dated to 1982 in English.<ref name="merrweb"/> Other senses of the word have been in use since at least 1810.<ref name=dicthistq>{{cite book |last1=Poirier |first1=Claude |last2= Canac-Marquis |first2=Steve |title=Dictionnaire historique du français québécois |publisher=[[Université Laval]] |year=1998 |isbn=978-2-7637-7557-9}}</ref>

According to [[Merriam-Webster]], a popular etymology is that ''poutine'' is from a Québécois slang word meaning "mess", and that others attribute it to the English word ''[[pudding]]''. The exact provenance of the word ''poutine'' is uncertain.<ref name="merrweb"/>

The ''Dictionnaire historique'' mentions the possibility that the form ''poutine'' is simply a [[Francization|gallicization]] of the word ''pudding''. However, it considers it more likely that the term was inherited from regional languages in France, with some meanings shaped later by the influence of the similarly sounding English word ''pudding''. It cites the [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]] forms {{lang|fr|poutingo}} "bad stew" and {{lang|fr|poutité}} "hodgepodge" or "crushed fruit or foods"; {{lang|fr|poutringo}} "mixture of various things" in [[Languedocien dialect|Languedocien]]; and {{lang|fr|poutringue}} or {{lang|fr|potringa}} "bad stew" in [[Franche-Comté]] as possibly related to ''poutine''. The meaning "fries with cheese and gravy" of ''poutine'' is among those held as probably unrelated to ''pudding'', provided the latter view is correct.<ref name=dicthistq/>

==Recipe==
[[File:LaBanquise.jpg|thumb|[[La Banquise]], a poutinerie in Montreal, serves more than thirty varieties of poutine.<ref name="SemenakBanquise"/>]]
The traditional recipe for poutine consists of:
* [[French fries]]: These are usually of medium thickness and fried (sometimes twice) such that the inside stays soft, while the outside is crispy.<ref name="OliverTips" />
* [[Cheese curds]]: Fresh cheese curds are used to give the desired texture. The curd size varies, as does the amount used.<ref name="EdmistonSqueak" />
*Brown [[gravy]]: Traditionally, it is a light and thin beef or chicken <!--unsourced: veal or turkey-->gravy,<ref name="OliverTips" /><ref name="OxfordCompanion"/> somewhat salty and mildly spiced with a hint of pepper;<ref name="SemenakBanquise"/> or a ''sauce brune'',<ref name="GollnerBest"/> which is a combination of chicken and beef stock<!--not sourced: a variant originating in Quebec-->.<ref name="OliverTips" /><ref name="foodrepublic.com"/><!--unsourced: These sauces typically also contain [[vinegar]] or a [[Flavour enhancer|sour flavouring]] to balance the richness of the cheese and fries.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}--> Poutine sauces ({{langx|fr|mélange à sauce poutine}}) are sold in Quebec, Ontario, and [[The Maritimes|Maritime]] grocery stores in jars or cans and in powdered mix packets; some grocery chains <!--like [[Sobeys]]--> offer their own house-brand versions. Many stores and restaurants also offer vegetarian gravy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://604now.com/2014/05/8-places-to-find-vegetarian-poutine-in-vancouver/ |title=things to do, people to see, places to go |publisher=604 Now |date=15 May 2014 |access-date=15 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517120518/http://604now.com/2014/05/8-places-to-find-vegetarian-poutine-in-vancouver/ |archive-date=17 May 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{efn|Brown gravy, as Americans use the term – consisting of flour, butter, ketchup, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and beef broth<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grouprecipes.com/83623/basic-all-american-brown-gravy.html/ |title=Basic All-american Brown Gravy Recipe |date=1 Jan 2011 |access-date=12 May 2022 |archive-date=5 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221105195551/http://www.grouprecipes.com/83623/basic-all-american-brown-gravy.html/ |url-status=live }}</ref>{{failed verification|date\May 2022|date=May 2022}} – is not an appropriate substitute for proper ''sauce brune''.}}

To maintain the texture of the fries, the cheese curds and gravy are added immediately before serving the dish. The hot gravy is usually poured over room-temperature cheese curds, so they are warmed without melting completely.<ref name="SemenakBanquise"/> The thin gravy allows all the fries to be coated.<ref name="OliverTips" /> The serving dish typically has some depth to act as a basket for the fries so that they retain their heat.<ref name="ArmstrongQuebec"/>{{rp|195}} It is important to control the temperature, timing, and the order in which the ingredients are added to obtain the right [[mouthfeel|food textures]]—an essential part of the experience of eating poutine.<ref name="poutinedynamics"/>

Freshness and juiciness of the curds is essential. Air and moisture seep out of the curds over time, altering their acidity level. This causes proteins to lose their elasticity, and the curds to lose their complex texture and characteristic squeaky{{efn
|name=b
|Cheese curds are also known as [[squeaky cheese]].<ref name="PostMany"/> The fresher the curds, the louder they squeak when chewed.<ref name=poutinedynamics/><ref name="EdmistonSqueak"/> In ''The Wall Street Journal'', Adam Leith Gollner described chewing fresh curds as "like a rusty doorhinge swinging open between your teeth".<ref name="GollnerBest"/> Those from the Centre-du-Québec region do not consider a poutine authentic if it does not squeak.<ref name="OliverTips" />
}} sound when chewed.<ref name="EdmistonSqueak" /> The curds should be less than a day old, which requires proximity to a dairy.<ref name="GollnerBest"/> While Montreal is {{convert|60|km}} from a cheese plant in [[Mirabel, Quebec|Mirabel]], restaurants and specialty cheese shops outside of dairy regions may be unable to sell enough curds to justify the expense of daily deliveries. Furthermore, Canadian food safety practices require curds to be refrigerated within 24&nbsp;hours, which suppresses the properties of their texture.<ref name="EdmistonSqueak"/> This has resulted in ''poutineries'' which specialize in the dish; busy poutineries may use {{convert|100|kg}} of curds per day.<ref name="SemenakBanquise"/> Poutineries which are too distant from dairies<!--e.g.: Caribou Poutine in UK--> may make their own cheese curds on site, in batches every few hours, to ensure a fresh and steady supply.<ref name="WoodsTreasure"/>

===<span id="Regional variations"></span>Variations===
[[File:Poutine.JPG|thumb|Poutine made with thick beef gravy on french-fried potatoes with fresh cheese curds is a style commonly found outside Quebec.|alt=Poutine with a thicker beef gravy]]

The texture, temperature and viscosity of poutine's ingredients differ and continuously change as the food is consumed, making it a dish of highly dynamic contrasts<!--, which creates a rich and memorable sensory experience-->. Strengthening these contrasts, superior poutines are identified by the crispiness of the fries, freshness of the curds, and a unifying gravy.<ref name="poutinedynamics" /> Even small variations in ingredients or preparation—the oil used for frying, the origin of the curds, or spices in the gravy—can result in a distinctly different experience of eating the poutine.<ref name="poutinedynamics" />

Some recipes eliminate the cheese, but most [[Québécois people|Québécois]] would call such a dish a {{lang|fr|frite sauce}} ({{langx|en|french fries with gravy}}), not poutine. When curds are unavailable, [[mozzarella]] cheese may be an acceptable alternative.<ref name="OliverTips" /> Shredded mozzarella is commonly used in Saskatchewan.<ref name="SharpGooey" /><!--unsourced Shawinigan and some other regions have ''patate-sauce-choux'' where shredded raw cabbage replaces cheese.{{cn}}--> Sweet potato may be used as a healthier alternative to french fries, adding more dietary fibre and vitamins.<ref name="MichaelPlayful"/>

Poutineries, like Montreal's La Banquise, which is credited for much of the innovation and popularization of poutine, have dozens of varieties of poutine on their menus.<ref name="SemenakBanquise" /> Many of these are based on the traditional recipe with an added meat topping such as sausage, chicken, [[bacon]], [[brisket]], or [[Montreal-style smoked meat]], with the gravy adjusted for balance.<ref name="leaderpost.com">{{cite news |title=Taste Regina: Prairie Poutine – Local chefs create Saskatchewan variations of Quebec-born dish |newspaper=[[The Leader-Post]] |first=CJ |last=Katz |date=18 June 2014 |url=http://www.leaderpost.com/life/Prairie+Poutine/9949266/story.html |access-date=7 December 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704032422/http://www.leaderpost.com/life/Prairie+Poutine/9949266/story.html |archive-date=4 July 2014 }}</ref> The [[Quebec City]]-based chain [[Chez Ashton]] is known for its poutine Galvaude (topped with chicken and green peas) and Dulton (with ground beef).<ref name="ChavichHaute"/> New variations are frequently introduced.

Poutine is found in the northern border regions of the United States, including [[New England]] and the larger [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], the [[Pacific Northwest]], and the [[Upper Midwest]].<ref name="KleinRaising"/> These regions offer further variations of the basic dish, usually by utilizing cheeses other than fresh curds, which are not widely available in the US. In the country culture, a mixed fry can also come with cooked [[ground beef]] on top and is referred to as a hamburger mix, though this is less popular than a regular mix.<ref name="SternGood"/><ref name="OliverTips" /> In the Pacific Northwest, one variation replaces the gravy with [[chowder]] featuring local seafood.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jackson-Glidden |first1=Brooke |title=There's a New Spot for Pacific Northwestern Fish and Chips on East Burnside |url=https://pdx.eater.com/2020/8/17/21372262/rock-paper-fish-portland-opening |access-date=24 September 2020 |work=Eater Portland |date=17 August 2020|archive-date=15 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201115173137/https://pdx.eater.com/2020/8/17/21372262/rock-paper-fish-portland-opening |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Tomky |first1=Naomi |title=Why Chowder Fries Could Be the Signature Dish Seattle's Been Waiting For |url=https://www.thrillist.com/eat/seattle/seattle-chowder-fries |access-date=24 September 2020 |work=Thrillist |date=28 March 2018 |archive-date=19 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201019204045/https://www.thrillist.com/eat/seattle/seattle-chowder-fries |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Nutrition==

Health advocates have been critical of poutine since the 1980s.<ref name="WoodsTreasure"/> In a 2013 study of Canadian restaurants, poutine was found to have the second-highest [[sodium in biology|sodium]] (1547&nbsp;mg average and as high as 2227&nbsp;mg) among single meal items, after stir-fry entrées.<ref name="Scourboutakos2013" />

==Social mobility and appropriation==
The social status of poutine has evolved dramatically since its origins in rural Quebec in the 1950s.

==In politics==
In a ''[[Talking to Americans]]'' segment on the Canadian mock television news show ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]'', during the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 US election]], comedian [[Rick Mercer]] posed as a reporter and asked US politicians what they thought of "Prime Minister Jean Poutine" and his endorsement of [[George W. Bush]] for president. (The Prime Minister of Canada at the time was [[Jean Chrétien]].) None of the interviewees noticed the insertion of "Poutine" and Bush pledged to "work closely" with Mr. Poutine.<ref name="SekulesStaple"/><ref name="TrillinFunny"/><ref name="CBCPrank"/> A few years later, when Bush made his first official visit to Canada as president, he joked in a speech, "There's a prominent citizen who endorsed me in the 2000 election, and I wanted a chance to finally thank him <!--for that endorsement.-->[...] I was hoping to meet Jean Poutine." The remark was met with laughter and applause.<ref name="WhiteHouse2004"/>

[[File:Wikimania 2017 Vladimir Poutine restaurant.jpg|thumb|right|Signage outside Montreal's Vladimir Poutine restaurant<!--photo from Wikimania 2017-->]]
In French, Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]]'s surname is spelled "Poutine", with the two having identical pronunciation.<ref name="MarquisRussia" /><ref name="BilefskyVlad" /> The similarity has been a source of confusion; in commenting on the ''Talking to Americans'' prank on Bush, ''[[Washington Post]]'' columnist Al Kamen mistakenly believed that Mercer's fictional Jean Poutine was a reference to Putin.<ref name="CBCPrank" /> In 2017, Russian-themed poutinerie Vladimir Poutine opened in Montreal, with dishes named for <!--despotic-->political figures from Rasputin to Donald Trump.<ref name="BrownsteinVlad" /> In the week following the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]], frequent insults and threats<!--every 10 minutes according to co-founder--> were received by the three Maison de la Poutine restaurants in Paris, some stating a belief that they worked for the Russian state. Another poutinerie in Lyon changed the name of its 20-year signature dish, Vladimir poutine, stating that it "was no longer funny". In Quebec, Le Roy Jucep announced that it was retiring the word ''poutine'' in support of Ukraine and reverted to "{{lang|fr|italic=no|fromage-patate-sauce}}" on its menus and branding.<ref name="CeccoThreat" /><ref name="ButterfieldThreat" /><ref name="BilefskyVlad" />
