A '''taco''' ({{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|t|ɑː|k|oʊ}}, {{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|t|æ|k|əʊ}}, {{IPAc-es|lang|'|t|a|k|o}}) is a traditional [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican dish]] consisting of a small hand-sized [[corn tortilla|corn-]] or [[Flour tortilla|wheat-based tortilla]] topped with a [[Stuffing|filling]]. The tortilla is then folded around the filling and [[finger food|eaten by hand]]. A taco can be made with a variety of fillings, including beef, pork, chicken, seafood, beans, vegetables, and [[cheese]], and garnished with various condiments, such as [[salsa (sauce)|salsa]], [[guacamole]], or [[sour cream]], and vegetables, such as lettuce, coriander, onion, tomatoes, and [[Chili pepper|chiles]].<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://read.dukeupress.edu/hahr/article/94/1/153/10959/Planet-Taco-A-Global-History-of-Mexican-Food |access-date=2024-07-22 |journal=Hispanic American Historical Review |doi=10.1215/00182168-2390303 |title=Planet Taco: A Global History of Mexican Food |date=2014 |last1=Boyer |first1=Christopher R. |volume=94 |pages=153–154 |url-access=subscription }}</ref> Tacos are a common form of [[antojito]]s, or [[Mexican street food]], which have spread around the world.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lemon |first=Robert |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/j.ctvh9w19c |title=The Taco Truck: How Mexican Street Food Is Transforming the American City |date=2019 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn=978-0-252-04245-4 |doi=10.5406/j.ctvh9w19c|jstor=10.5406/j.ctvh9w19c }}</ref>

Tacos can be contrasted with similar foods such as [[burrito]]s, which are often much larger and rolled rather than folded; [[taquito]]s, which are rolled and fried; or [[chalupa]]s/[[Tostada (tortilla)|tostadas]], in which the tortilla is fried before filling.

In Spain, the word "taco" can also be used in the context of ''{{ill|tacos de jamón|es}}'':  these are diced pieces of ham, or sometimes bits and shavings of ham leftover after a larger piece is sliced.<ref>Jesús Ventanas, ''El jamón Ibérico. De la dehesa al paladar.'', Ediciones Mundi-Prensa, 2006, p. 102.</ref> They can be served on their own as [[tapas]] or street food, or can be added to other dishes such as [[salmorejo]], [[omelettes]], [[stews]], [[empanadas]], or ''{{ill|melón con jamón|es}}''.<ref>Julio César, (2011), ''El gran libro de las tapas'', Ed.

According to one etymological theory, the culinary origin of the term "taco" in Mexico can be traced to its employment, among Mexican [[silver]] miners, as a term signifying "plug." The miners used explosive charges in plug form, consisting of a paper wrapper and gunpowder filling.<ref name="smithsonian" />

Indigenous origins are also proposed. One possibility is that the word derives from the [[Nahuatl]] word {{Lang|nah|tlahco}}, meaning "half" or "in the middle",<ref name="Karttunen" /> in the sense that food would be placed in the middle of a tortilla.<ref>[http://www.nexos.com.mx/?p=21200 Florilegio Verbal Náhuatl] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925072628/http://www.nexos.com.mx/?p=21200 |date=2017-09-25 }}, Nexos, Mar. 12, 2016</ref> Furthermore, dishes analogous to the taco were known to have existed in [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbia]]n society—for example, the Nahuatl word {{Lang|nah|tlaxcalli}} (a type of corn tortilla).<ref name="Karttunen">{{cite book   | title = An Analytical Dictionary of Nahuatl | author= Frances E.

==History==
There is significant debate about the origins of the taco in Mexico, with some arguing that the taco predates the arrival of the Spanish in Mexico, since there is anthropological evidence that the indigenous people living in the lake region of the [[Valley of Mexico]] traditionally ate tacos filled with small fish.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |last=Friesen |first=Katy June |date=May 3, 2012 |title=Where Did the Taco Come From? |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/where-did-the-taco-come-from-81228162/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221124155012/https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/where-did-the-taco-come-from-81228162/ |archive-date=2022-11-24 |access-date=2023-01-28 |website=Smithsonian Magazine |language=en}}</ref> Writing at the time of the Spanish conquistadors, [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]] documented the first taco feast enjoyed by Europeans, a meal which [[Hernán Cortés]] arranged for his captains in [[Coyoacán]].<ref name="History">{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502160526/http://www.iccjournal.biz/StudentScholars/Undergraduate/history_of_mexican_cuisine.htm|url=http://www.iccjournal.biz/StudentScholars/Undergraduate/history_of_mexican_cuisine.htm |title=History of Mexican Cuisine |access-date=30 January 2015 |publisher=Margaret Parker |url-status=usurped|archive-date = 2 May 2008}}</ref><ref name="History2">{{cite web |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070811132510/http://www.mexicanmercados.com/food/foodhist.htm | archive-date = 11 August 2007 |url=http://www.mexicanmercados.com/food/foodhist.htm |title=A Thumbnail History of Mexican Food |access-date= 30 January 2015 |url-status = usurped |publisher=Jim Conrad}}</ref> Others argue that the advent of the taco is much more recent, with one of the more popular theories being that the taco was invented by silver miners in the 18th century.<ref name=":2" />

One of the oldest mentions of the term ''taco'' comes from an 1836 cookbook —''Nuevo y sencillo arte de cocina, reposteria y refrescos''— by Antonia Carrillo; in a recipe for a rolled pork loin (lomo de cerdo enrollado), she instructs the readers to roll the loin like they would a "''taco de tortilla''" or tortilla taco.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carrillo |first1=Antonia |title=Nuevo y sencillo arte de cocina, reposteria y refrescos |date=1836 |publisher=Imprenta de Santiago Perez |location=Mexico |page=108 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XaZAAQAAMAAJ&q=Taco%20de%20tortilla |access-date=19 November 2023}}</ref> 
Another mention of the word taco comes from the novel —''El hombre de la situación'' (1861)— by Mexican writer [[Manuel Payno]]:<ref>{{cite book |last1=Payno |first1=Manuel |title=El hombre de la situacion |date=1861 |publisher=Juan Abadiano |location=Mexico |page=147 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jD7sCvlFKNEC |access-date=19 November 2023}}</ref> {{quote|“They surrounded the father's bed, and he, putting a pillow on his legs, which served as a table, began to give the example, and a pleasant gathering was formed, which was completed by the mother, who always entered last, waving with one hand (from right to left) a large cup of white [[atole]], while with the other, she carried right to her mouth, a tortilla taco filled with a spread of red chile.}} These instances disprove the theory that the first mention of the word "taco" in Mexico was in the 1891 novel Los bandidos de Río Frío by [[Manuel Payno]].<ref>Yvonne [https://www.autostraddle.com/taco-tuesday-the-incomplete-history-of-tacos-305695/ "Taco Tuesday: The incomplete history of Tacos" ''Autostraddle'' (Sep. 3, 2015)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221124155012/https://www.autostraddle.com/taco-tuesday-the-incomplete-history-of-tacos-305695/ |date=2022-11-24 }} (Accessed Nov. 24, 2022)</ref> 

It should also be noted that term ''taco'' was regional, specifically from Mexico City and surrounding areas, and that other regional names existed. In [[Guanajuato]], [[Guerrero]], [[Michoacán]], and [[San Luis Potosí]], the terms used were ''burrito'' and ''burro''; while in [[Yucatán]] and [[Quintana Roo]] the term used was ''codzito'' (coçito).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ramos y Duarte |first=Féliz |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u2xQAAAAMAAJ&q=burrito |title=Diccionario de Mejicanismos |publisher=Imprenta de Eduardo Dublan |year=1895 |page=98}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Santamaría |first1=Francisco J. |title=Diccionario de Mejicanismos |date=1959 |publisher=Editorial Porrúa |location=Mexico City |page=158 |edition=Second |url=https://archive.org/details/diccionariodemej00sant/page/158/mode/2up?view=theater&q=Taco |access-date=23 April 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Burrito |url=https://dem.colmex.mx/Ver/burrito |website=Diccionario del Español de México. |publisher=Colegio de México |access-date=23 April 2024}}</ref> Due to the cultural influence of Mexico City, the term ''taco'' became the default, and terms like ''burrito'' and ''codzito'', either became forgotten or evolved to mean something different in modern times.

In the mid-1950s, [[Glen Bell]] opened Taco Tia, and began selling a simplified version of the tacos being sold by Mexican restaurants in [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], particularly the ''tacos dorados'' being sold at the Mitla Cafe, owned by Lucia and Salvador Rodriguez across the street from another of Bell's restaurants.<ref name=":0" /> Over the next few years, Bell owned and operated a number of restaurants in southern California including four called El Taco.<ref name="company">{{cite web|url=http://www.tacobell.com/company/|title=Company Information|date=August 9, 2011|publisher=Taco Bell|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812223309/http://www.tacobell.com/company|archive-date=August 12, 2011|access-date=August 16, 2011}}</ref> The tacos sold at Bell's restaurants were many Anglo Americans' first introduction to Mexican food.<ref name=":0" /> Bell sold the El Tacos to his partner and built the first [[Taco Bell]] in [[Downey, California|Downey]] in 1962.

===Soft-shell tacos===
[[File:Tacos at restaurant Chalupa.jpg|thumb|Three soft-shell tacos with beef filling at a restaurant in [[Helsinki]], Finland]]
Traditionally, soft-shelled tacos referred to corn tortillas that were cooked to a softer state than a hard taco – usually by grilling or steaming. More recently, the term has come to include flour-tortilla-based tacos mostly from large manufacturers and restaurant chains. In this context, ''soft tacos'' are tacos made with [[wheat]] flour tortillas and filled with the same ingredients as a hard taco.<ref name="BigOven">{{cite web |url=http://www.bigoven.com/14723-(Homemade-Fresh)-Chorizo-Soft-Tacos-recipe.html |title=Homemade Chorizo Soft Tacos (recipe) |access-date=2008-07-09 |publisher=BigOven.com |archive-date=2009-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618214310/http://www.bigoven.com/14723-(Homemade-Fresh)-Chorizo-Soft-Tacos-recipe.html |url-status=live }}</ref>{{clear}}

===Breakfast taco===

===Indian taco===
Indian tacos, or ''[[Navajo]] tacos'', are made using [[frybread]] instead of tortillas. They are commonly eaten at [[pow-wow]]s, [[festival]]s, and other gatherings by and for indigenous people in the [[Native Americans in the United States|United States]] and [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Canada]].<ref name="FryBread">{{cite web |url=http://www.whatscookingamerica.net/History/NavajoFryBread.htm |title=Navajo Fry Bread and Indian Tacos: History and Recipes of Navajo Fry Bread and Indian Tacos |access-date=3 January 2014 |publisher=Linda Stradley |archive-date=25 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225050427/http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/NavajoFryBread.htm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Indian_taco">{{Cite web |url=http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/suburban/40494777.html |title=Hundreds attend powwow |access-date=3 January 2014 |publisher=Louisiana Broadcasting LLC and Capital City Press LLC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304182126/http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/suburban/40494777.html |archive-date = 4 March 2009}}</ref>

This kind of taco is not known to have been present before the arrival of Europeans in what is now the [[Southwestern United States]]. [[Navajo people|Navajo]] tradition indicates that frybread came into use in the 1860s when the government forced the tribe to relocate from their homeland in [[Arizona]] in a journey known as the [[Long Walk of the Navajo]]. It was made from ingredients given to them by the government to supplement their diet since the region could not support growing the agricultural commodities that had been previously used.<ref name = smithsonianmag>{{cite web | url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/frybread.html | title = Frybread | access-date = 2012-01-20 | last = Miller | first = Jen | work = Smithsonian.com | archive-date = 2013-12-02 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131202172556/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/frybread.html | url-status = dead }}</ref>

===Puffy tacos, taco kits, and tacodillas===
Since at least the late 1930s, a variation called the "'''puffy taco'''" has been popular in the [[Lower Rio Grande Valley]] and the surrounding area.

Kits are available at grocery and [[convenience store]]s and usually consist of taco shells (corn tortillas already fried in a U-shape), seasoning mix and [[taco sauce]].
