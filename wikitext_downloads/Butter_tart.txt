{{Canadian cuisine}}
A '''butter tart''' ({{langx|fr|tarte au beurre}}) is a type of small [[pastry]] tart highly regarded in [[Canadian cuisine]]. The sweet tart consists of a filling of [[butter]], [[sugar]], syrup, and [[egg (food)|egg]], baked in a [[pastry]] shell until the filling is semi-solid with a crunchy top.<ref name=great>{{Cite episode |title=What makes a great butter tart? |series=[[Morningside (radio program)|Morningside]] |credits= Presenter:[[Peter Gzowski]] Guests:Max Burns, Marion Kane, Charles Pachter |network=[[CBC Radio]] |station=[[CBC Radio One]] |location=[[Moose Jaw]] |airdate=December 5, 1991}}</ref> The butter tart should not be confused with [[butter pie]] (a savoury pie from the [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] area of [[Lancashire]], [[England]]) or with [[bread and butter pudding]].

Recipes for the butter tart vary according to the families baking them. Because of this, the appearance and physical characteristics of the butter tart – the firmness of its pastry, or the consistency of its filling – also vary.<ref name=SS/><ref>{{citation|title=Better butter tarts |journal=The Ottawa Citizen |date=October 26, 2006 |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/lifestyle/food/story.html?id=be2adf75-3134-4a2d-97b2-280c9155d9c2 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110140939/http://www.canada.com/topics/lifestyle/food/story.html?id=be2adf75-3134-4a2d-97b2-280c9155d9c2 |archive-date=November 10, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>

Traditionally, the [[English Canadian]] [[tart]] consists of butter, sugar, and eggs in a pastry shell, similar to the French-Canadian [[sugar pie]]. The butter tart is different from the sugar pie given the lack of flour in the filling.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/butter-tarts|title=Butter tarts|encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|access-date=August 29, 2019}}</ref> The butter tart is different from the American [[pecan pie]] in that it has a "runnier" filling due to the omission of [[corn starch]]. Often [[raisin]]s, [[walnut]]s, or [[pecan]]s are added to the traditional butter tart, although the acceptability of such additions is a matter of national debate.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bonisteel |first1=Sara |title=Butter Tarts, Canada's Humble Favorite, Have Much to Love |journal=The New York Times |date=2018-01-12 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/dining/butter-tarts-canada.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Jackson |first1=Lisa|title=The sticky sweet history of the butter tart| date=January 2018 |url=https://www.foodnetwork.ca/shows/great-canadian-cookbook/blog/the-sticky-sweet-history-of-the-butter-tart|publisher=Food Network}}</ref> As an iconic Canadian food and one of the most popular desserts in the country, the raisin-or-no-raisin question can provoke polarizing debate.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Grief |first1=Amy |title=Step Down, Nanaimo Bars.

==History==
Butter tarts became common in Canadian pioneer cooking, and they remain a characteristic pastry of Canada. It is primarily eaten in and associated with the English-speaking provinces of [[Canada]].

The butter tart is a derivative of one or more of the following:<ref name="great" />
*Border tart: a similar pie including dried fruit from the [[Anglo-Scottish border|Anglo-Scottish border country]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.torontosun.com/life/eat/2010/06/07/14296321.html |title=On the butter tart trail |newspaper=[[Toronto Sun]] |date=June 16, 2010 |access-date=September 22, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619031502/http://www.torontosun.com/life/eat/2010/06/07/14296321.html|archive-date=19 June 2010 }}</ref>
*[[Sugar pie]] (''{{lang|fr|tarte au sucre}}''): which possibly came with the arrival of the "[[King's Daughters]]" in [[Quebec]] during the 1600s, where the imported brides used [[maple syrup]], [[butter]] and [[dried fruit]] to make a possible precursor to modern examples of the butter tart.<ref name=SS>{{citation |first=Susan |last=Sampson |url=https://www.thestar.com/Life/article/211699 |title=The art of the tart |date=May 9, 2007 |publisher=Toronto Star |website=thestar.com |access-date=August 25, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024012753/http://www.thestar.com/Life/article/211699 |archive-date=October 24, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The butter tart is sometimes described as a smaller, tart-sized version of the sugar pie.
*[[Pecan pie]]: which possibly came north from the southern [[United States]]{{speculation inline|date=August 2019}},
*Backwoods pie: which is found in [[the Maritimes]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=Backwoods Pie |url=https://thebitehouse.com/blog/2012/01/02/backwoods-pie |access-date=2023-03-11 |website=Bite House |date=January 2, 2012 |language=en-US}}</ref> and western Canada and made with corn syrup,
*[[Shoofly pie]]: which is made with molasses and comes from the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] community,
*[[Treacle tart]]: which is an English pastry made with [[golden syrup]] or [[treacle]].

The earliest published Canadian recipe is from [[Barrie]], Ontario, dating back to 1900 and can be found in The Women's Auxiliary of the Royal Victoria Hospital Cookbook,<ref name=hj>{{Citation |title=Structural Elements in Canadian Cuisine |first=Hersch |last=Jacobs |journal=Cuizine: The Journal of Canadian Food Cultures |volume=2 |number=1 |year=2009 |url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/cuizine/2009/v2/n1/039510ar.html }}</ref> to which a chef by the name of Mrs. Mary Ethel MacLeod submitted the recipe for a butter tart filling.<ref>Mrs. Malcolm MacLeod and her recipe for butter tart filling https://www.simcoe.ca/Archives/Pages/Mrs-MacLeods-Butter-Tarts.aspx</ref> The original cookbook and recipe is housed at the Simcoe County Archives.<ref>{{Citation |title=The Canadian history of the butter tart (video) |journal=Breakfast TV Video, City TV |url=http://www.bttoronto.ca/videos/the-canadian-history-of-the-butter-tart/|date=January 17, 2018 }}</ref> Another early publication of a butter tart recipe was found in a 1915 pie cookbook.<ref name=great/> The food was an integral part of early Canadian cuisine and often viewed as a source of pride.<ref name=hj/>

Similar tarts are made in Scotland, where they are often referred to as ''Ecclefechan butter tarts'' from the town of [[Ecclefechan]].  In [[France]], they are related to the much more common ''{{lang|fr|tarte à la frangipane}}'', that differs from the basic Canadian recipe only by the addition of ground almonds.

''[[National Geographic]]'' recognized the significance of the butter tart in an article on Georgian Bay, Ontario. In October 2013, referring to a stand in Wasaga Beach, they stated that "It's the homemade Canadian butter tarts – flaky crust with gooey pecan filling – that set this place apart from other lakeside ice cream stands."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/canada/georgian-bay-ontario/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921174602/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/canada/georgian-bay-ontario/|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 21, 2016|title=Georgian Bay|date=September 30, 2013|website=Travel}}</ref>

The production of butter tarts in Canada slowed after a flood in Quebec, in April 2019, striking a major production centre. Global News reported the Vachon bakery in Sainte-Marie-de-Beauce had to be evacuated after a long-term flood. In July, Global News reported the bakery was slowly getting back to speed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/5350929/quebec-vachon-jos-louis-shortage-floods/|title=Jos Louis pastry bakery slowly resumes production after severe flooding in Quebec - Montreal|last=Laframboise|first=Kalina|date=June 4, 2019 |website=globalnews.ca |language=en |access-date=September 6, 2019}}</ref>
