A '''pineapple bun''' ({{zh|t=菠蘿包|j=bo<sup>1</sup> lo<sup>4</sup> baau<sup>1</sup>}}) is a kind of [[sweet roll|sweet bun]] predominantly popular in [[Hong Kong]]<ref name=cnn-travel-1>{{cite news|title=Hong Kong food: 40 dishes we can't live without – 6. 'Pineapple' bun|url=http://travel.cnn.com/hong-kong/none/40-things-eat-hong-kong-coronary-arrest-820489|access-date=5 January 2014|publisher=CNN Travel|date=13 July 2010}}</ref> and also common in [[Chinatown]]s worldwide.<ref name=wisegeek-1>{{cite web|title=What Is a Pineapple Bun|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-pineapple-bun.htm|work=wisegeek|publisher=Conjecture Corporation|access-date=5 January 2014|last1=Sandhana|first1=Lakshmi|date=16 May 2024}}</ref> Despite the name, it does not traditionally contain [[pineapple]]; rather, the name refers to the look of the characteristic topping (which resembles the texture of a pineapple).

==History==

The origin of the pineapple bun is unclear. The earliest documented evidence of the pineapple bun can be traced back to Hong Kong in 1942. It was during this time that the Tai Tung Bakery first opened its doors to the public. The shop owner, Tse Ching-yuen, recalls that he has been making pineapple buns since he was just 11 years old. However, he acknowledges that there were similar baked goods in Japan before that period.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Ngo |first1=Hope |date=2022-09-08 |title=What Hong Kong-Style Pineapple Buns Are Really Made Of |url=https://www.tastingtable.com/998515/what-hong-kong-style-pineapple-buns-are-really-made-of/ |access-date=2023-06-12 |website=Tasting Table}}</ref> At the time, they were called 酥皮包 (crispy-skin buns), but customers kept calling them pineapple buns. 

By another account, the Ng family was deported from Mexico to Hong Kong and opened a restaurant there in 1946. They slightly adapted the [[concha]] to the local palate, creating the pineapple bun.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Pineapple Bun: A Breakfast Dish And Symbol of Cultural Heritage |url=https://www.slurrp.com/article/pineapple-bun-a-breakfast-dish-and-symbol-of-cultural-heritage-1658460793144 |access-date=2023-06-12 |website=Slurrp|first1=Jasmine|last1=Kaur|date=2022-07-24}}</ref>

In June 2014, the [[government of Hong Kong]] listed the pineapple bun as a part of [[Hong Kong]]'s intangible cultural heritage. Tai Tung Bakery in Yuen Long, which had been making pineapple buns for more than 70 years, was a key proponent of including the technique for making the buns on the list of 480 items of living heritage.<ref name="Tsang secrets">{{cite news|last1=Tsang|first1=Denise|title=The secrets behind serving up Hong Kong's 'hot cross buns'|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1587246/secrets-behind-serving-hong-kongs-hot-cross-buns|access-date=23 November 2014|agency=South China Morning Post|issue=8 September 2014|date=8 September 2014}}</ref>

==Composition==
The top of the pineapple bun (the part which is made to resemble a pineapple) is made of a dough similar to that used to make [[sugar cookie]]s, which consists of sugar, [[egg (food)|eggs]], flour, and [[lard]]. It is crunchy and is quite sweet compared to the bread underneath. The bread dough underneath is that which is used in Hong Kong–style breads, which is a softer and sweeter dough than in European breads. It is popular at breakfast or afternoon tea.

Although it is known as a "pineapple bun", the traditional version contains no pineapple. The name originated from the fact that its sugary top crust is cooked to a golden-brown colour, and because its checkered top resembles the skin of a pineapple.<ref>{{cite web|title=Where's The Pineapple?|date=27 May 2007 |url=https://mykitchenmylaboratory.blogspot.com/2007/05/wheres-pineapple_27.html|publisher=My Kitchen: My Laboratory|access-date=29 June 2009}}</ref>

==Buttered variant==
[[File:菠蘿油 (Pineapple Bun) (3476646912).jpg|thumb|right|Buttered pineapple bun]]
Many Hong Kong restaurants, such as ''[[cha chaan teng]]s'' and ''[[dai pai dong]]s'', offer an item called a buttered pineapple bun, which is a pineapple bun with a slice of [[butter]] stuffed inside. They are known in Cantonese as '''boh loh yau''' (菠蘿油), in which ''boh loh'' means "pineapple", and ''yau'' (oil) refers to butter. Variants of this include using [[custard]] in place of butter.{{citation needed|date=October 2025}}

Typically the bun is brought hot from the oven to the diner's table, and served halved with a large slab of butter in between the halves.

==Other common variants==
The pineapple bun may come in miniature sizes, it may be used as a bread roll for sandwiches with [[Lunch meat|luncheon meat]], or it may be pre-stuffed with [[red bean paste]], [[custard]] cream (奶黃), [[Char siu|barbecued pork]], or a sweet filling of [[Coconut|shredded coconut]] (椰絲) like that in a [[cocktail bun]]. It is possible to order a "pineapple pineapple bun", actually stuffed with pineapple.{{citation needed|date=October 2025}}

Japanese [[melonpan]] and Korean [[soboro bread]]<ref>{{cite web | title = Korean Soboro Bread | work = Korean Slate | access-date = 24 August 2011 | date = 28 October 2009 | url = http://koreanslate.com/korean-soboro-bread.html
}}</ref> are variants that use the same ingredients for a German [[streusel]]-like texture on top, but without resemblance to a pineapple.

==Controversy==
In October 2020, a Japanese bakery ''c'est très fou'' launched the product "Taiwanese pineapple bun", which received criticism for suggesting the product originated in Taiwan, though the bakery's introduction of the product had correctly mentioned that the bun originated in Hong Kong. In January 2021, another Japanese bakery was criticized for calling it "Taiwan pineapple bun".<ref>{{Cite web |last=子萱 |first=楊 |date=2021-01-19 |title=Japan wrongly called the inventor of Hong Kong pineapple buns |url=https://chinapost.nownews.com/20210119-2038107 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211003093345/https://chinapost.nownews.com/20210119-2038107 |archive-date=2021-10-03 |website=The China Post, Taiwan}}</ref>
