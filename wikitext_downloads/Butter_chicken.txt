==Preparation==
Chicken is [[marination|marinated]] for several hours in a mixture of [[lemon juice]], [[dahi (curd)|dahi]] (yogurt), [[Kashmiri red chilli]], salt, [[garam masala]], [[ginger]] paste, and garlic paste.

The marinated chicken is cooked in a [[tandoor]] (traditional clay oven), but may be grilled, oven-roasted, or pan-fried. It is served in a mild curry sauce that includes butter. The sauce is a tomato, garlic, and ginger-based sauce that is simmered until smooth and much of the water has evaporated. There are many variations on the composition and spicing of the sauce, which is sieved so that it is velvety smooth. Spices may include [[cardamom]], [[cumin]], [[clove]]s, [[cinnamon]], [[coriander]], [[black pepper|pepper]], [[garam masala]], and [[fenugreek]] ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]/[[Hindi]]: kasuri methi). [[Cashew]] paste may be used as a thickener and it is finally garnished with coriander.
