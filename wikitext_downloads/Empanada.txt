An '''empanada''' is a type of baked or fried [[turnover (food)|turnover]] consisting of [[pastry]] and [[stuffing|filling]], common in [[Culture of Spain|Spain]], [[Portugal|Portugal]], other [[Southern Europe]]an countries, [[North Africa]]n countries, West African countries (also known as Meatpie in Nigeria), South Asian countries, [[Latin American culture|Latin America]]n countries, and the [[Culture of the Philippines|Philippines]]. The name comes from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] {{lang|es|empanar}} (to bread, i.e., to coat with bread),<ref>{{Cite web |title=empanar |url=https://www.spanishdict.com/translate/empanar |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220929035949/https://www.spanishdict.com/translate/empanar |archive-date=September 29, 2022 |access-date=September 28, 2022 |website=[[SpanishDict]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last1=ASALE|first1=RAE-|last2=RAE|title=empanar {{!}} Diccionario de la lengua española|url=https://dle.rae.es/empanar|access-date=January 20, 2022|website=«Diccionario de la lengua española» - Edición del Tricentenario|language=es|archive-date=October 25, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211025104952/https://dle.rae.es/empanar|url-status=live}}</ref> and translates as 'breaded', that is, wrapped or coated in bread. They are made by folding dough over a filling, which may consist of meat, cheese, tomato, corn, or other ingredients, and then cooking the resulting turnover, either by baking or frying.

==Origins==
The origin of empanadas is unknown, but they are thought to have originated in 7th century [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], a region in northwest [[Spain]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Historia de la empanada criolla |url=http://www.produccion-animal.com.ar/temas_historia/76-empanadas.pdf |work=Dra.

An empanada (''empãada'') is mentioned in the [[Cantigas de Santa Maria]] 57:VI (c. 1282):<blockquote>Entr' esses roubadores / viu jazer um vilão / desses mais malfeitores, / ũa perna na mão / de galinha, freame / que sacara com fame / entom dũ' '''empãada''' | que so um seu çurame/ comer quisera, / mais nom podera, / ca Deus nom queria.<ref>Santalha, José-Martinho Montero.

==By country and region==

===Argentina===
[[File:Empanadas cordobesas (Argentina) caseras.JPG|thumb|Homemade empanadas from [[Córdoba, Argentina]]|left]]
[[Argentine cuisine|Argentine]] empanadas are often served during parties and festivals as a starter or main course. Shops specialize in freshly made empanadas, with many flavors and fillings.

Every region of Argentina has its own characteristic variant. Those of Salta (''[[salteña]]s'') are small, juicy and spicy, and contain potatoes, peppers and ground chili. These are also popular in neighbouring [[Bolivia]].

The Jujuy variant adds peas and [[garlic]]. Its filling is called {{Lang|es|recado}} and the {{Lang|es|repulgue}} (method of closing the empanada) {{Lang|es|simbado}}. The [[La Rioja, Argentina|La Rioja]] variant includes hard-boiled egg, red bell pepper, olives, and raisins. In Jujuy, there are two variants: ''criollas'' and ''arabes''. Those of Santiago are considered especially juicy. Those of [[Catamarca Province|Catamarca]] are similar but smaller. [[Tucumán Province|Tucumán]] is known for the empanada creole; an annual National Empanada festival is held in Famaillá. Those of Famaillá are made with ''[[matambre]]'' and fried in good fat, competing with the {{Lang|es|entreveradas}} (mixed-grated), in which the {{Lang|es|matambre}} is mixed with chicken breast, garlic, ground chili, hard-boiled egg and cumin. Those of [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] are large and include olives and garlic. Those of [[San Juan, Argentina|San Juan]] have a higher proportion of onion, making them juicier and slightly sweet. Olives are also common and sometimes fat is also added to the {{Lang|es|recado}} or the dough. In San Luis they are big, seasoned with oregano and hot pepper, and kneaded with pork fat. In [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], there is a version ''"Pastel Federal"'' "federal cake" or {{Lang|es|empanadas de Misia Manuelita}}.<ref name=":0" /> These are famous because pears boiled in wine with cloves were added to their filling. Today they are not so sweet but it is tradition to sprinkle them with sugar. In Traslasierra they add carrots and potatoes. In the Litoral, where immigrants from various parts of the world predominated, Santa Fe, Entre Ríos and Corrientes fill them with river fish, such as ''[[surubí]]'' (catfish) or ''dorado'', or with white sauce and Goya cheese. In the Cordillera of Patagonia, they are made with lamb and on the coast with seafood. In [[Buenos Aires]], the [[Creole peoples|Creole]] empanada is so important that it has been declared a Cultural Heritage of Food and Gastronomy by the Argentine Ministry of Culture.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Empanadas: su origen y una historia extensa|url=http://misionesalinstante.com/?a=26265|access-date=August 3, 2020|website=misionesalinstante.com|language=en|archive-date=January 9, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210109235224/http://misionesalinstante.com/?a=26265|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite news|date=October 5, 2018|title=El mapa definitivo de las empanadas argentinas con sus 14 versiones|url=https://www.lanacion.com.ar/lifestyle/el-mapa-definitivo-empanadas-argentinas-sus-14-nid2175466|access-date=August 3, 2020|newspaper=La Nación|language=es|archive-date=March 30, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200330152436/https://www.lanacion.com.ar/lifestyle/el-mapa-definitivo-empanadas-argentinas-sus-14-nid2175466|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Brazil===
{{Further|Pastel (Brazilian food)}}
[[File:Brazilian pastel.jpg|thumb|Brazilian pastel|right]]
In [[Brazil]], a '''{{lang|pt|pastel}}''' ({{plural form}}: {{lang|pt|pastéis}}) consists of half-circle or rectangle-shaped thin-crust pies with assorted fillings, fried in vegetable oil. The result is a crispy, brownish fried pie. The most common fillings are [[ground meat]], [[mozzarella]], [[Catupiry]], [[heart of palm]], [[Cod as food|codfish]], [[cream cheese]], [[Chicken as food|chicken]] and small [[Shrimp and prawn as food|shrimp]]. Pastéis with sweet fillings such as [[Goiabada|guava paste]] with [[Minas cheese]], banana and chocolate also exist.

===Chile===
Traditional Chilean styles include ''empanada de pino'' or ''de horno'', filled with seasoned ground beef, onions, olives, raisins, and hard-boiled eggs and cooked in an oven, and cheese-filled empanadas with crimped edges which are deep-fried.

===Colombia===
[[File:Colombian empanadas with ají.jpg|thumb|A bowl of Colombian beef empanadas, served with salsa de ají|right]]In Colombia, like in Venezuela, empanadas are made with corn and are typically filled with beef or chicken. They are sometimes served with salsa de [[Ají (sauce)|ají]], a chilli sauce.

===Ecuador===

[[File:Empanadas de viento .jpg|thumb|Ecuadorian empanadas de viento|left ]]
The traditional Ecuadorian style is called "empanada de viento" (literally, "wind empanada").  These are made from thin-rolled flour dough and filled with cheese, sometimes with onions mixed in, and deep-fried.  The "viento" refers to the fact that as they fry they fill with air, leaving them hollow (but coated with cheese inside).  They can be served sweet, sprinkled with sugar, or savory, with salsa de ají.

All these versions are baked.

The fried versions can be made of puff pastry or shortcrust pastry and are called [[rissole]]s. The most famous is the {{Lang|fr|{{ill|Rissoles de Coucy|fr|Rissoles de Coucy|lt=rissole de Coucy}}}}, filled with meat or fish.

===Galicia===
[[Image:Bandejas de empanadas gallegas.jpg|thumb|''Empanadas galegas'']]
Galician empanada ({{Langx|gl|empanada galega}}) is a variety of empanada and one of the most popular dishes of [[Galician cuisine]], commonly served in the towns of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] during festivals and [[pilgrimage]]s. It is prepared with a variety of fillings, including local seafood, [[chorizo|sausage]], and chicken. It can be served hot or cold. The origin of this preparation is determined in the preparation of cakes in embers that were initially made directly in embers until it evolved into a preparation in clay pots that give it its current characteristic round shape. The preparation is mainly homemade and is done in ovens, but nowadays, it is common to find it for sale in bakeries or street stalls.

The history of this dish in the region dates back to the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] era in the 7th century, when rules for their preparation were decreed.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tejeiro |title=De la comida y otras sensualidades |publisher= |location= |year= |isbn=|language=es}}</ref> The first referenced empanada used mushroom or chicken fillings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cunqueiro |title=Cocina Gallega |language=es|publisher=|location=|year=|isbn=}}</ref> The empanada was an ideal food for travelers because it is a covered preparation that prevented contact of the interior with the dust of the roads. Galician empanadas appear sculpted as early as the 12th century on the [[Portico of Glory]] in [[Santiago de Compostela]].<ref>{{cite book|last=López Ferreiro |title=El Pórtico de la Gloria, Platerías y el Primitivo Altar Mayor de la catedral de Santiago|location=Santiago de Compostela|publisher=Pico Sacro|edition=1st|year=|isbn=|language=es}}</ref>

===Indonesia===
[[File:Panada.JPG|thumb|Indonesian Minahasan {{Lang|id|panadas}}]]
In [[Indonesia]], empanadas are known as {{Lang|id|panada}}. They are especially popular in [[Manado cuisine]] of [[North Sulawesi]] where their {{Lang|id|panada}} has a thick crust made from fried bread, filled with spicy {{Lang|id|cakalang}} fish ([[skipjack tuna]]) and chili, [[curry]], potatoes or [[quail egg]]s. The {{Lang|id|panada}} in North Sulawesi was derived from [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] influence in the region.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indonesiakaya.com/pustaka-indonesia/panada-kue-lezat-peninggalan-bangsa-portugis-di-manado/|title=Panada, Kue Lezat Peninggalan Bangsa Portugis di Manado|access-date=February 28, 2021|archive-date=March 8, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308105922/https://indonesiakaya.com/pustaka-indonesia/panada-kue-lezat-peninggalan-bangsa-portugis-di-manado/|url-status=live}}</ref> The dish is similar to {{Lang|id|[[Curry puff#Indonesia|karipap]]}} and [[kue pastel|pastel]], although they have a thinner crust compared to panada.
