The 1912 recipe mentioned by Toomre is in Alekandrova-Ignatieva, 1912, p. 611, but was also published in earlier editions.</ref><ref name="Volokh" /><ref name="Syutkin" /> The recipe involves beef ''cubes'' (not strips) prepared in a dry marinade of salt and allspice, and then sautéed in butter. The sauce is a simple [[roux]] mixed with [[Mustard (condiment)|prepared mustard]] and [[broth]], and finished with a small amount of sour cream: no [[onion]]s, no [[mushroom]]s and no alcohol.

In 1891, the French chef Charles Brière, who was working in Saint Petersburg, submitted a recipe for beef Stroganoff to a competition sponsored by the French magazine ''[[L'Art culinaire]]''.<ref name="Syutkin" /> This led ''[[Larousse Gastronomique]]'' to assume that he was the inventor of this dish, but both the recipe and the name existed before then.

Beef Stroganoff preparation varies significantly not only based on geography, but based on other factors as well, such as the cut of meat and seasonings selected. Meat for the dish can be cut in different ways and is sometimes diced, cubed, or cut into strips. Some variations include mushrooms and onions or other vegetables and varied seasonings such as sugar, salt, black pepper, and bottled [[Marination|marinades]] (especially [[Worcestershire sauce]]) and rubs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/01/beef-stroganoff-rethinking-food-lab.html |title=The Food Lab: Rethinking Beef Stroganoff |publisher=Serious Eats |access-date=15 January 2018 |archive-date=5 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105100725/http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/01/beef-stroganoff-rethinking-food-lab.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Brazil ===
The Brazilian variant includes diced beef or strips of beef with tomato sauce, ketchup, onions, mushrooms and heavy cream. Brazilians also prepare Stroganoff with chicken or even shrimp instead of beef. It is commonly served with a side of shoe-string potatoes and white rice. In Portuguese it is called ''Strogonoff'' or ''Estrogonofe''.

=== France ===
[[File:Beef Stroganoff.jpg|thumb|Beef Stroganoff cooked with paprika and served with rice]]
The French encyclopedia of gastronomy ''[[Larousse Gastronomique]]'' lists Stroganoff as a cream, [[paprika]], veal stock and white wine recipe.

==== Japan ====
Stroganoff's popularity extends to Japan, where it is most commonly served with white rice, or white rice seasoned with parsley and butter.  Its popularity increased dramatically with the introduction of "instant sauce cubes" from [[S&B Foods]].  These are cubes with dried seasoning and thickening agents that can be added to water, onion, beef, and mushrooms to make a Stroganoff-style sauce.  Additionally, Japanese home recipes for Stroganoff frequently call for ingredients that are outside of Russian tradition, such as small amounts of soy sauce.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

[[File:Korv stroganoff.jpg|thumb|Swedish ''[[Korv Stroganoff]]'' with [[Falukorv]], served with [[rice]].]]
Stroganoff is also popular in [[Nordic countries]]. In Sweden, a common variant is ''Korv stroganoff'' ({{lit|sausage stroganoff}}), which traditionally uses the local ''[[falukorv]]'' sausage as a substitute for the beef

In Finland, the dish is called ''makkarastroganoff'' ({{lit|sausage stroganoff}}).<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-04-03 |title=Tomaattinen makkarastroganov – maukas arkiruoka |url=https://yle.fi/a/20-299289 |access-date=2025-04-07 |website=Yle Luovat sisällöt ja media |language=fi |archive-date=2025-04-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250417030826/https://yle.fi/a/20-299289 |url-status=live }}</ref> Beef Stroganoff is, however, also a common dish in Finland.
