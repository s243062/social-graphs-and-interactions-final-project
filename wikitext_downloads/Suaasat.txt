'''Suaasat''' ({{ipa|kl|suaːsat}}) is a traditional [[Greenlandic cuisine|Greenlandic]] soup.  It is traditionally made from [[seal meat]], but can also be made from [[whale meat|whale]], [[Reindeer|caribou]], or [[seabird]]s.

The soup often includes [[onion]]s and [[potato]]es and is simply seasoned with [[salt]], [[black pepper]], and [[Bay leaf|bay leaves]]. The soup is often thickened with rice or by soaking barley in the water overnight so that the starches leach into the water.
