'''Rice and curry''' is a popular dish in [[Sri Lanka]], as well as in other parts of the [[Indian subcontinent]].

Rice and curry dinner comprises the following:

* A large bowl of [[rice]], can be [[Cooked rice|boiled]] or [[Fried rice|fried]]. Sometimes ''[[kiribath]]'', rice cooked in coconut milk, is served.
* A vegetable curry, perhaps of green beans, [[jackfruit]] or leeks.
* A [[curry]] of meat, most often [[Chicken (food)|chicken]] or [[Fish (food)|fish]] but occasionally [[goat]] or [[lamb and mutton|lamb]]
* [[Dal|Dhal]], a dish of spiced lentils.
* [[Papadum]]s, a thin crisp wafer made from legume or rice flour and served as a side dish.
* Sambals, which are fresh chutney side dishes; they may include red onion, chili, grated coconut and lime juice, and are often the hottest part of the meal.

Each bowl contains small portions, but as is traditional in most countries in tropical Asia, if a bowl is emptied, it is immediately refilled.

The curry uses [[chili pepper]]s, [[cardamom]], [[cumin]], [[coriander]] and other spices. It has a distinctive taste. The Southern cuisines use ingredients like dried fish which are local to the area.

While natives are born into this cuisine and develop a tolerance to spicy food, many visitors and tourists to the country often find the spiciness excessive. As a result, many local restaurants in developed and tourist areas offer special low-spice versions of local foods to cater to foreign palates or have an alternative "Western" menu for visitors and tourists.{{citation needed|date=May 2024}}
