It was developed by [[Cyril Callister]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]], for the [[Fred Walker Company]] in 1922 and was first sold in stores on 25 October 1923. 

A [[Spread (food)|spread]] for sandwiches, toast, [[crumpet]]s and [[cracker (food)|cracker biscuits]] as well as a filling for pastries, Vegemite is similar to other yeast-based spreads such as [[Marmite]] in the UK and its [[Marmite (New Zealand)|New Zealand version]], Australian [[Promite]], [[Three Threes Condiments|MightyMite]], [[AussieMite]], OzEmite, German [[Vitam-R]] and Swiss [[Cenovis]].

Vegemite has a strong flavour. It is salty, slightly bitter, [[malt]]y and has an [[umami]] flavour similar to [[Bouillon cube|beef bouillon]] (because it is rich in [[Glutamic acid|glutamates]]). It is low-[[FODMAP]], [[Veganism|vegan]], [[Kashrut|kosher]] and [[halal]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://vegemite.com.au/faqs/ |title=FAQs – Start with Vegemite |website=vegemite.com.au |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210620185332/https://vegemite.com.au/faqs/ |archive-date=20 June 2021 |access-date=21 November 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> It is known for being high in [[B vitamins]].

== History ==

=== Beginnings ===
[[File:Fred Walker.jpg|thumb|left|Fred Walker's company first created and sold Vegemite in 1922]]
In 1919, following the disruption of British [[Marmite]] imports after [[World War&nbsp;I]], the Australian company Fred Walker & Co. gave Cyril Callister the task of developing a spread from the used yeast being dumped by [[Brewery|breweries]]. Callister had been hired by the chairman [[Fred Walker (entrepreneur)|Fred Walker]].<ref name=":0" />

Callister used [[Autolysis (biology)|autolysis]] to break down the yeast cells from waste obtained from the [[Carlton & United Breweries|Carlton & United brewery]]. Concentrating the clear liquid extract and blending with salt, celery and onion extracts formed a sticky black paste.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hanan |date=25 April 2020 |title=Vegemite |url=https://alldownunder.com/australian-food/vegemite.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201106232333/https://alldownunder.com/australian-food/vegemite.htm |archive-date=6 November 2020 |access-date=23 August 2021 |website=All Down Under |language=en-US}}</ref>

Following a competition to name the new spread with a prize pool of [[Australian pound|£A]]50 ({{Inflation|AU|50|1919|fmt=eq|cursign=[[A$]]}}), "Vegemite" was selected by Fred Walker's daughter Sheilah,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deliciouskitchen.com.au/products/krafthistory/fredwalkerfounder/fredwalker.aspx |title=Fred Walker, Founder |publisher=[[Kraft Foods Inc.|Kraft Foods]] |year=2010 |access-date=23 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130920191432/http://www.deliciouskitchen.com.au/Products/KRAFTHistory/FredWalkerFounder/FredWalker.aspx |archive-date=20 September 2013 }}</ref> and it was registered as a trademark in Australia in 1919; the name of the person who coined the name is not known.<ref>{{Cite web |title=VEGEMITE Story - VEGEMITE |url=https://vegemite.com.au/heritage/the-vegemite-story/ |access-date=11 September 2023 |website=Tastes Like Australia |language=en-AU |archive-date=8 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230608175640/https://vegemite.com.au/heritage/the-vegemite-story/ |url-status=live }}</ref> 

Vegemite first appeared on the market in 1923 with advertising emphasising its value to children's health, but it failed to sell well.<ref name=100gi>{{cite book |title=100 Great Icons |last1=Sheedy |first1=Chris |author2=Jenny Bond |year=2006 |publisher=Random House Australia |location=Milsons Point, New South Wales |isbn=978-1-74166-501-7 |pages=34–35 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OJgQh7pd8Y4C |access-date=12 November 2011 |archive-date=11 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230911220010/https://books.google.com/books?id=OJgQh7pd8Y4C |url-status=live }}</ref> Faced with growing competition from Marmite, from 1928 to 1935 the product was renamed "Parwill" to make use of the advertising slogan "Marmite but Parwill", a two-step [[pun]] on the new name and that of its competitor; i.e. "If Ma [mother] might ... then Pa [father] will." This attempt to expand [[market share]] was unsuccessful and the name reverted to Vegemite, but it did not recover its lost market share.<ref name=Story/>

===Commercial success===
In 1925, Walker had established the Kraft Walker Cheese Co. as a joint venture company with [[Kraft Foods Inc.|J. L. Kraft & Bros]] to market [[processed cheese]] and, following the failure of Parwill, in 1935 he used the success of Kraft Walker Cheese to promote Vegemite. Following the death of Walker in 1935, the Fred Walker Company was absorbed by Kraft Walker Cheese Co., a subsidiary of Kraft Co.<ref name=":0" /> In a two-year campaign to promote sales, Vegemite was given away free with Kraft Walker cheese products (with a coupon redemption) and this was followed by poetry competitions with imported American [[Pontiac (automobile)|Pontiac]] cars being offered as prizes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurekacouncil.com.au/Australia-History/History-Pages/1922-vegemite.htm |title=History of Vegemite – 1922 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723130242/http://www.eurekacouncil.com.au/5-Australia-History/History-Pages/1922-vegemite.htm |archive-date=23 July 2008 |publisher=[[Eureka Council]] |website=eurekacouncil.com.au|access-date=30 April 2018}}</ref> Sales responded and in 1939 Vegemite was officially endorsed by the [[British Medical Association]] as a rich source of [[B vitamins]]. Rationed in Australia during World War II, Vegemite was included in Australian [[Field ration|Army rations]] and by the late 1940s was used in nine out of ten Australian homes.<ref>[http://about.nsw.gov.au/collections/doc/packaged-vegemite-made-by-kraft-foods-limited/ Vegemite] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925171630/http://about.nsw.gov.au/collections/doc/packaged-vegemite-made-by-kraft-foods-limited/ |date=25 September 2013 }} About NSW NSW.gov</ref>

===Recent years===
In April 1984, a {{convert|115|g|adj=on}} jar of Vegemite became the first product in Australia to be electronically [[Barcode reader|scanned]] at a [[Point of sale|checkout]].<ref name="100gi"/><ref name="Story"/>

Vegemite is produced in Australia at its [[Port Melbourne]] manufacturing facility, which produces more than 22 million jars annually. Virtually unchanged from Callister's original recipe, Vegemite now far outsells Marmite and other similar spreads in Australia. The billionth jar of Vegemite was produced in October 2008.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,24449523-953,00.html |agency=AAP |title=Vegemite produces billionth jar |first=Winston |last=Tan |date=5 October 2008 |access-date=6 October 2008 |archive-date=8 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008104002/http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,24449523-953,00.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Vegemite was also produced in New Zealand for over 50 years, but as of August 2006 production had ceased. The [[Marmite (New Zealand)|New Zealand version of Marmite]] remains successful there.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/australians/5/4 |title=New Zealanders take to Vegemite |author=John Wilson |encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |publisher=[[New Zealand Government]] |date=4 March 2009 |access-date=26 April 2011 |archive-date=22 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522171630/http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/australians/5/4 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10793281 |title='Marmageddon': There's always Vegemite, says PM |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=20 March 2012 |access-date=19 February 2014 |quote=Mr Key told ''Firstline'' this morning that he also likes the Australian-made rival Vegemite. |archive-date=11 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111023256/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10793281 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vegemite.com.au/Pages/vegemite-faqs.aspx |title=Vegemite FAQs |access-date=19 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140126183329/http://www.vegemite.com.au/Pages/vegemite-faqs.aspx |archive-date=26 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marmite.co.nz/home-page/faqs |title=Marmite FAQs |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829214640/http://www.marmite.co.nz/home-page/faqs |archive-date=29 August 2006 |access-date=31 January 2015 |url-status=live |quote='Are Marmite and Vegemite both made in NZ?'

== Consumption ==
A common way of eating Vegemite is on toasted bread with a layer of butter or margarine. Only a small amount of Vegemite is required due to its strong flavour. A Vegemite sandwich<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.food.com/recipe/vegemite-sandwich-tradional-veggie-sanger-501850|title=Vegemite Sandwich Tradional (Veggie Sanger) Recipe - Food.com|website=www.food.com|access-date=1 January 2023|archive-date=1 January 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230101023823/https://www.food.com/recipe/vegemite-sandwich-tradional-veggie-sanger-501850|url-status=live}}</ref> consists of two slices of buttered bread and Vegemite, but other ingredients such as cheese, lettuce, avocado or tomato may be added.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://about-australia-shop.com/vegemite.htm|title=Vegemite|website=about-australia-shop.com|access-date=30 April 2018|archive-date=7 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707075529/http://about-australia-shop.com/vegemite.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

Vegemite can be used as a filling for pastries, such as the [[cheesymite scroll]], or it may be used in more exotic dishes.<ref>{{Cite web|title=16 ways to cook with Vegemite this Australia Day|url=https://www.delicious.com.au/recipes/collections/gallery/8-ways-to-cook-with-vegemite-this-australia-day/24aq5vus|access-date=23 August 2021|website=delicious.com.au}}</ref>

== Nutritional information ==
Vegemite is a source of B&nbsp;vitamins, specifically [[thiamine]], [[riboflavin]], [[Vitamin B3|niacin]] and [[folate]] (B{{sub|1}}, B{{sub|2}}, B{{sub|3}} and B{{sub|9}}, respectively). The base version contains no [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B{{sub|12}}]] (cobalamin) although both [[Vitamin B6|vitamin B{{sub|6}}]] (pyridoxine) and vitamin B{{sub|12}} are added to the low-salt formulation.<ref name="Reduced Salt Vegemite">{{cite web|url=https://www.vegemite.com.au/products/vegemite-reduced-salt|title=Reduced Salt Vegemite|work=FAQs|publisher=Kraft foods|access-date=23 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313174054/http://www.vegemite.com.au/products/vegemite-reduced-salt|archive-date=13 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The main ingredient of Vegemite is [[yeast extract]], which contains a high concentration of [[glutamic acid]], the source of Vegemite's [[umami]] flavour. Vegemite does not contain any fat, added sugar or animal content. It contains [[gluten]] (a composite of [[storage protein]]s) as the yeast is derived from brewing.<ref name="auspopcul">{{cite book |title=Australian Popular Culture |last=White |first=Robert |editor1-first=Ian |editor1-last=Craven |editor2-first=Martin |editor2-last=Gray |editor3-first=Geraldine |editor3-last=Stoneham |chapter=A Brief Cultural History of Vegemite |year=1994 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, United Kingdom |isbn=0-521-46667-9 |pages=19–20 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bLbo4sr-xfwC |access-date=12 November 2011 |archive-date=11 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230911220014/https://books.google.com/books?id=bLbo4sr-xfwC |url-status=live }}</ref>

A low-salt version of Vegemite was introduced in September 2014. It has a 25% reduction in sodium content. The low-salt version is also fortified with vitamin B{{sub|6}} and [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B{{sub|12}}]].<ref name="Reduced Salt Vegemite" />

== Advertising and branding ==
Originally promoted as a healthy food for children, during [[World War&nbsp;II]] advertising emphasised its medicinal value:
<blockquote>Vegemite fights with the men up north! If you are one of those who don't need Vegemite medicinally, then thousands of invalids are asking you to deny yourself of it for the time being.<ref name=eurekacouncil>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurekacouncil.com.au/Australia-History/History-Pages/1922-vegemite.htm |title=History of Vegemite – 1922 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723130242/http://www.eurekacouncil.com.au/5-Australia-History/History-Pages/1922-vegemite.htm |archive-date=23 July 2008 |publisher=The Eureka Council |access-date=23 September 2010}}</ref></blockquote>
At the same time, "[[Nursing|Sister]] MacDonald" insisted that Vegemite was essential for "infant welfare" in magazines. Later advertisements began to promote the importance of the B complex vitamins to health.{{Cn|date=August 2021}}

Vegemite's rise to popularity was helped by the marketing campaigns written by [[J. Walter Thompson|J.&nbsp;Walter Thompson advertising]] that began in 1954, using groups of smiling, healthy children singing a catchy [[jingle]] titled "We're happy little Vegemites".<ref>[http://aso.gov.au/titles/ads/happy-little-vegemites/ Happy Little Vegemites] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110422163535/http://aso.gov.au/titles/ads/happy-little-vegemites/ |date=22 April 2011 }}. australianscreen.</ref>
:We're happy little Vegemites
:As bright as bright can be.
:We all enjoy our Vegemite
:For breakfast, lunch, and tea.
:Our mummies say we're growing stronger
:Every single week,
:Because we love our Vegemite
:We all adore our Vegemite
:It puts a rose in every cheek.

First aired on radio in 1954, the jingle was transferred to television in 1956. This advertising campaign continued until the late 1960s but, as it was targeted to children, it was discontinued in favour of ads promoting the product to all ages. In the late 1980s the original black and white television commercial was [[remaster]]ed, partially [[Film colourisation|colourised]] and reintroduced. This commercial was to be broadcast periodically from 1991 to 2010.<ref name="Story"/> The two young twin girls who sang this advertising jingle were known as the "Vegemite Twins".<ref name="auto">{{Cite web |title=History of Vegemite in Timeline - Popular Timelines |url=https://populartimelines.com/t/32593/Vegemite |access-date=19 November 2022 |website=populartimelines.com |language=en |archive-date=29 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221129182704/https://populartimelines.com/t/32593/Vegemite |url-status=live }}</ref>

In March 2007, Kraft announced that they were trying to trace the eight original children from the campaign to celebrate the advertisement's 50th anniversary and to take part in a new campaign.<ref>{{cite news | work= [[The Australian]] | title = Modern tots replace the veteran happy Vegemites | first = Simon | last = Canning | department = Features | page = 13 | date = 15 March 2007 | access-date = 17 October 2010 | url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21383399-7582,00.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070321151257/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21383399-7582,00.html | archive-date = 21 March 2007 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The 1956 commercial was to be remade with the original children, now grown, to forge a link between "the new generation and the old ad". The media took up the search on Kraft's behalf with all eight children identified in eight days and resulted in many TV specials and interviews in the Australian national media. The 50-year reunion campaign won the ''Arts, Entertainment & Media Campaign of the Year'' award at the November 2007 Asia Pacific [[Public relations|PR]] Awards.<ref>(14 November 2007) [http://offlinehbpl.hbpl.co.uk/events/6XX/PRAwards07_revised%20supp.pdf Asia Pacific PR Awards 2007] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517122831/http://offlinehbpl.hbpl.co.uk/events/6XX/PRAwards07_revised%20supp.pdf |date=17 May 2008 }}</ref>

== Variations ==
=== Vegemite Singles ===
During the 1990s, Kraft released a product in Australia known as Vegemite Singles. It combined two of Kraft's major products, [[Kraft Singles]] and Vegemite, into one, thus creating Vegemite-flavoured cheese. This extension of the Vegemite product line was an attempt by Kraft to capitalise on the enormous popularity of Vegemite and cheese sandwiches (made by placing a slice of cheese into a Vegemite sandwich). Vegemite Singles were later taken off the market.<ref>{{Cite web |last=O'Connell |first=Jan |date=21 September 1970 |title=Kraft Singles launched - Australian food history timeline |url=https://australianfoodtimeline.com.au/kraft-singles/ |access-date=19 November 2022 |website=Australian Food Timeline |language=en-AU |archive-date=29 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221129215032/https://australianfoodtimeline.com.au/kraft-singles/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Vegemite Cheesybite ===
[[File:Vegemite.JPG|thumb|The newer Cheesybite beside the original Vegemite]]
On 13 June 2009, Kraft released a new version of Vegemite. The formula combines Vegemite and Kraft [[cream cheese]], spreads more easily and has a considerably less salty and milder taste than the original. To coincide with the release of the new recipe, Kraft ran a competition to give the new flavour a name.<ref>{{cite news |work=[[Herald-Sun]] |title=Quite a crafty spread Vegemite and cheese join forces in the jar |first=Megan |last=McNaught |page=13 |date=15 June 2009 |access-date=5 September 2009 |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25633920-661,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617053028/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0%2C21985%2C25633920-661%2C00.html |archive-date=17 June 2009  }}</ref> The new name was announced during the broadcast of the [[2009 AFL Grand Final]] as ''iSnack 2.0''.

=== My First Vegemite ===
In 2011, Kraft Foods Australia launched "My First Vegemite", a special formulation of original Vegemite for children aged older than one year. According to Kraft, the new formula has a "milder taste" and "additional health benefits including iron, B{{sub|6}} and B{{sub|12}} vitamins as well as 50% less sodium", and was designed in response to consumer demand for foods with lower sugar and salt content plus additional health benefits. Immediate reaction and media reports regarding the new formula were largely positive, but Kraft Foods Australia discontinued the "My First Vegemite" product line in 2012 due to poor sales performance.<ref name="auto"/>

=== Chocolate and Vegemite ===
In April 2015, [[Cadbury]] announced that it was to release a Vegemite-flavoured block of chocolate on 1 June. The chocolate block is Cadbury's [[Caramilk|Caramello]] block updated by mixing vegemite with the chocolate. Critics described the taste as similar to salted caramel with a pleasant umami aftertaste. Criticism varied from "love it" to "tastes like they mixed the [[caramel]] and [[turkish delight]] filling with a lot of salt" to "needs more salt", with several tasters commenting that they thought the aftertaste was unpleasant.<ref>{{cite news |ref=Delaney |last1=Delaney |first1=Brigid |title=Vegemite chocolate taste test: is Cadbury's new block awesome or evil? |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2015/may/18/vegemite-chocolate-taste-test-is-cadburys-new-block-awesome-or-evil |date=18 May 2015 |access-date=1 May 2022 |archive-date=14 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214220417/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2015/may/18/vegemite-chocolate-taste-test-is-cadburys-new-block-awesome-or-evil |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Time out">{{cite web |title=Cadbury has released that Vegemite chocolate block – and we tried it |author=Time Out Sydney |website=sydneyland.au.timeout.com |url=http://sydneyland.au.timeout.com/2015/05/20/cadbury-has-released-that-vegemite-chocolate-block-and-we-tried-it/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906003536/http://sydneyland.au.timeout.com/2015/05/20/cadbury-has-released-that-vegemite-chocolate-block-and-we-tried-it/ |archive-date=6 September 2015 |date=20 May 2015 |access-date=1 May 2022}}</ref>

Following newspaper reports in May 2011 that Vegemite and Marmite had been banned and were being removed from shelves in Denmark, outraged fans set up several Facebook groups.
