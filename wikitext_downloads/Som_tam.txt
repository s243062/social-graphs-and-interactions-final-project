Green papaya salad is also widely popular in [[Thailand]], particularly in the [[Isan]] region, which shares close ethnic and cultural ties with Laos due to its predominantly [[Lao people|ethnic Lao]] population.

==Etymology==
The dish is deeply rooted in Lao cuisine, where it is traditionally called ''tam mak hoong'' ({{langx|lo|ຕຳຫມາກຫຸ່ງ}}, {{IPA|lo|tàm mȁːk.hūŋ|pron}}, {{literal translation|pounded papaya}}) or ''tam som'' ({{langx|lo|ຕໍາສົ້ມ}}, {{IPA|lo|tàm.sȍm|pron}}, {{literal translation|sour pounded [salad]}}), in which the word ''tam'' ({{langx|lo|ຕໍາ}}) refers to the pounding of ingredients in a [[mortar and pestle|mortar]], a method of preparation central to Lao and neighboring culinary traditions.

In Thailand, the salad is widely known as ''som tam'' ({{langx|th|ส้มตำ}}, {{IPA|lo|sôm.tām|pron}}, {{RTGS|somtam}}), combining the Thai words ''som'' (ส้ม, "sour") and ''tam'' (ตำ, "pounded"). In Isan, a region with strong cultural and linguistic ties to Laos, the salad uses Lao-derived names ''tam bak hung'' ({{langx|tts|ตำบักหุ่ง}}) or ''tam som'' ({{langx|tts|ตำส้ม}}).

Regional variations and names include:

* '''Burmese''': သင်္ဘောသီးသုပ် (''thìn bau: thi: thoùp'')
* '''Khmer''': បុកល្ហុង (''bok l’hong'')
* '''Rakhine''': ပဒကာသီးသုပ် (''pədəɡà θí θùp'')
* '''Vietnamese''': ''gỏi đu đủ'' (a general term for papaya salad, often less spicy)

==History==
[[Papayas]] and [[chili peppers]] were introduced to Southeast Asia by the Spanish and Portuguese explorers in the 17th century from the [[Americas]] in the [[Columbian Exchange]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Van Esterik |first=Penny |title=Food Culture of Southeast Asia |publisher=[[Greenwood Press]] |year=2008 |page=12 |isbn=978-0-313-34419-0}}</ref> [[Simon de la Loubère]] (1642–1729), a French diplomat, mentioned in his book that the cultivation of papaya was already widespread in Siam in 1693.<ref name="siamlaloubereeng">{{cite book|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo2/A48403.0001.001/1:11.9?rgn=div2;view=fulltext|last1=de La Loubère|first1=Simon|translator=A.P.|title=A New Historical Relation of the Kingdom of Siam A Description of the principal Fruits of Siam.|date=1693|language=en|access-date=17 February 2023|archive-date=17 February 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230217070913/https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo2/A48403.0001.001/1:11.9?rgn=div2;view=fulltext|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{citation|author=Bernard Maloney|title=Environmental Reconstruction at Ayutthaya|publisher=Southeast Asian Archaeology Newsletter|date=October 1999}}</ref>

Green papaya salad was mentioned as a favorite Lao dish by a former Lao politician, [[Katay Don Sasorith]] (1904–1959), in a memoir recounting his experience during his primary school years in 1910s.<ref name="sasorith">{{Cite book |last=Sasorith |first=Katay D |title= Souvenirs d'un ancien écolier de Paksé |publisher= Editions Lao Sedone |year=1958 |page=31}}</ref> Furthermore, according to the travelogue “Nirat Wang Bang Yi Khan” written in 1869 by Thai poet Khun Phum, the dish was already known among members of the Lao royal family living as war hostages in Bang Yi Khan compound in Bangkok, Siam.<ref>{{cite web|publication-date= 19 March 2015|title=Remnants of the Laos connection|url= https://www.bangkokpost.com/life/travel/501707/remnants-of-the-laos-connection|website=Bangkok Post|access-date=7 February 2025 |last1=Svasti |first1=Pichaya }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |publication-date=n.d.|language=th|title=นิราศวังบางยี่ขัน|url=https://vajirayana.org/นิราศวังบางยี่ขัน/นิราศวังบางยี่ขัน#google_vignette|website=vajirayana.org|access-date=7 February 2025}}</ref> Thai historian [[Sujit Wongthes]] has speculated that the green papaya salad originated during the late 18th to early 19th centuries in the communities of ethnic Chinese–Lao settlers living in what is now Central Thailand, where papayas were widely cultivated by Chinese immigrants. The Lao settlers, who were war captives deported from [[Lan Xang]], adopted the ancient Lao tradition of preparing salads from fruits, called ''tam som'', to make salads from papayas. The new dish became known as ''som tam'' (the reversed order of ''tam som'') and, along with the papayas, then spread to today's [[Northeast Thailand]] following the construction of the Northeastern railway line during the turn of the 19th–20th centuries. The dish became more popular after the opening of [[Mittraphap Road]] in 1957, and has since become widely adopted by the ethnic Lao people of both Isan and Laos. Likewise, the hot flavour also spread to Isan and Laos from Central Thailand, which had been introduced to chilli peppers first.<ref>{{cite news |date=25 December 2014 |title=′มะละกอ′มีกำเนิดจากทวีปอเมริกา มาเป็น′ส้มตำ′ เริ่มมีในบางกอก - สุวรรณภูมิในอาเซียน |language=th |trans-title='Papaya' - originated in the Americas, became 'som tam' in Bangkok |work=Matichon |url=https://www.matichon.co.th/news_detail.php?newsid=1419480546 |url-status=dead |access-date=29 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031349/https://www.matichon.co.th/news_detail.php?newsid=1419480546 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |publication-date=20 April 2007|language=th|title=ส้มตำของใคร?|url=https://anukpn.wordpress.com/2007/04/20/ส้มตำของใคร/|website=anukpn.wordpress.com |access-date=7 February 2025}}</ref>

However, papayas and chili peppers were already integrated in the Lao territory and Lao culinary recipes in mid-1800s to early 1900s<ref name="pallegoix"/><ref name="mouhot"/><ref name="estrade"/><ref name="sasorith"/> while, during the 1950s and 1960s, green papaya salad and other Lao dishes were rarely known in [[Bangkok]]. They could only be found around the boxing stadium that gathered boxers and fans from Northeastern Thailand, as well as in mobile food carts outside construction sites with Northeastern workers and gas stations serving long-distance bus drivers. Some believe that ''som tam'' gained popularity among the young Thai generations following an active publicity in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |publication-date=31 October 2016|title=Open Source!!Somtum Song (เปิดที่มา!!

Others believe that ''som tam'' has evolved from a Thai dish called ''pu tam or tam pu'' ({{Langx|th|ปูตำ}} หรือ ตำปู, {{lit|crab salad}}) mentioned in a recipe by chef, Khunying Plian Phatsakarawong in her 1908 cookbook.

==Preparation==
[[File:Zubereitung von Som Tam.JPG|thumb|right|Unripe papaya being sliced into thin strips during preparation of the salad]]{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2022}}

The dish combines the five main [[basic taste]]s: the sourness of the lime, spiciness of the chili, [[salt]]iness and [[Umami|savoriness]] of the [[fish sauce]], and sweetness of [[palm sugar]].{{Disputed inline|date=May 2024}}<!--Spiciness is not one of the five basic tastes. Bitterness is the fifth one not listed.-->

Pounded salads in Laos all fall under the parent category of ''tam som'', which may or may not contain green papaya; when no specific type of ''tam som'' is mentioned, it is generally understood to refer to green papaya salad. For absolute clarity, however, the name ''tam maak hoong'' may be used, since this name means "pounded papaya".

In Thailand, it is customary for a customer to ask the preparer to make the dish suited to the customer's own tastes. To specifically refer to the original style of papaya salad as prepared in Laos or Isan, it is known as {{lang|th|ส้มตำลาว}} or ''som tam Lao'' or simply as ''tam Lao'' and the dish as prepared in central Thailand may be referred to as ''som tam Thai''.

Traditionally, the local variety of green papaya salad in the streets of Bangkok is very spicy due to the addition of a fistful of chopped hot [[bird's eye chili]]. However, with its rising popularity among tourists, it is now often served less spicy than it used to be in the past.

Together with the papaya, some or most of the following secondary items are added and pounded in the mortar with the pestle:
*[[Asparagus bean]]s
*Brined "rice field crabs". These belong to the freshwater crab genera ''[[Sayamia]]'', ''[[Chulathelphusa]]'', and ''[[Esanthelphusa]]'' (previously classified as part of the genus ''[[Somanniathelphusa]]''), which all belong to the [[Gecarcinucidae|Gecarcinucid crab]] subfamily [[Parathelphusinae]].<ref>Ponchunchoovong, Samorn (2006).

*[[Lime (fruit)|Lime]] slice and lime juice
*Palm sugar
*[[Shrimp paste]]
*[[Fish paste]]
*Raw [[Thai eggplant]]
*[[Cherry tomato|Cherry]] or [[Grape tomato|grape]] tomatoes (green or ripe)

Green papaya salad is often served with [[glutinous rice]] and ''[[kai yang]]''/''ping gai'' (grilled chicken). It can also be eaten with fresh [[rice noodles]] or simply as a snack by itself with, for instance, crispy [[pork rind]]s. The dish is often accompanied by raw green vegetables such as [[Ipomoea aquatica|water spinach]] and [[Cabbage|white cabbage]] wedges on the side to mitigate the spiciness of the dish.

A non-spicy green papaya salad version exists in Laos, Vietnam and Thailand, which is much sweeter; it often contains crushed peanuts and is less likely to have fish paste or brined crab.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.panix.com/~clay/cookbook/bin/show_recipe.cgi?thai+recipe125|title=Clay's Kitchen : Tam Ra Ahan Thai (Thai Recipes) ตำราอาหารไทย|work=panix.com|access-date=11 April 2015|archive-date=4 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304194928/http://www.panix.com/~clay/cookbook/bin/show_recipe.cgi?thai+recipe125|url-status=live}}</ref> Dried [[brine shrimp]] are used in this Central Thai version.
