'''{{lang|pt|italic=unset|Caldo verde}}''' ({{IPA|pt|ˈkaldu ˈveɾðɨ|pron}}, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for "green broth") is a popular [[soup]] in [[Portuguese cuisine]].<ref name="Lacerda2009">{{cite book|author=Ilídio Lacerda|title=The Secrets of Portuguese Cookery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4zGVqkasA9EC&pg=PA31|accessdate=24 August 2013|date=December 2009|publisher=BoD – Books on Demand|isbn=978-3-8391-4529-6|pages=31–}}</ref>

The basic traditional ingredients for {{lang|pt|italic=unset|caldo verde}} are [[Julienning|julienned]] [[Portuguese cabbage]] or {{lang|pt|couve-galega}} (essentially a type of collard green), (or alternatively other leafy greens such as [[kale]] or [[mustard greens]]), potatoes, [[olive oil]], black pepper and salt, mainly flavoured with onion and garlic.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Illustrated Cook's Book of Ingredients | publisher=DK Publishing | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-7566-7673-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TZdT_Kndq_8C&pg=PA193 | accessdate=April 2, 2017 | page=193}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Portuguese Caldo Verde with Broa de Milho | website=The San Diego Participant Observer | url=https://www.parobs.org/index.php?module=article&view=4146 | access-date=2020-06-23 | archive-date=2021-05-31 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210531125937/https://www.parobs.org/index.php?module=article&view=4146 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Some regional recipes favour slight variations, like turnip greens or added meat, such as [[ham hock]], making it similar to [[wedding soup|Italo-American wedding soup]]. Traditionally, the soup is accompanied by slices of [[paio]], {{lang|pt|[[chouriço]]}} or {{lang|pt|[[linguiça]]}} (boiled whole with the potatoes, then sliced and added to the finished soup when serving) and with a Portuguese [[cornbread]] or [[rye bread]] called {{lang|pt|[[broa]]}} on the side for dipping.<ref name="Dragonwagon2007">{{cite book|author=Crescent Dragonwagon|title=The Cornbread Gospels|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3sdQ-MtWRMkC&pg=PA103|accessdate=24 August 2013|year=2007|publisher=Workman Publishing|isbn=978-0-7611-1916-6|pages=103–}}</ref> In Brazil, the soup is accompanied by [[pão francês]], as are virtually all kinds of soups.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pereira |first1=Luciano |title=French Rolls Popular in Brazil |url=https://www.world-grain.com/articles/15561-french-rolls-popular-in-brazil |website=World-grain.com |access-date=5 February 2024}}</ref> In Portugal, {{lang|pt|italic=unset|caldo verde}} is typically consumed during events such as [[wedding]]s, birthdays and popular celebrations.

==History==
{{lang|pt|italics=unset|Caldo verde}} originated from the [[Minho Province]] in northern Portugal, based on an earlier recipe brought to Portugal by English merchants.<ref name="Opello1991">{{cite book|author=Walter C. Opello|title=Portugal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cU1pAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=24 August 2013|year=1991|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-0488-5|page=6}}</ref> Today, it is a traditional favourite nationwide and abroad, particularly in significant communities of Portuguese descent found in locations like [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[France]], [[South Africa]], [[Macau]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Jersey]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Toronto]]. References to the soup appear in many novels by [[Camilo Castelo Branco]]. In 2011, following the result of a public vote, the soup was announced as one of Portugal's Seven Wonders of Gastronomy, highlighting both its popularity and heritage in Portugal.<ref>[https://wetravelportugal.com/caldo-verde/ Caldo Verde] wetravelportugal.com.
