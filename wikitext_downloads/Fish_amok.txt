'''Fish amok''' or '''''amok trei''''' ({{langx|km|អាម៉ុកត្រី}} {{IPA|km|ʔaːmok trəj|}}) is a [[Khmer cuisine|Khmer]] [[steamed curry|steamed]] fish curry (''amok'') with a [[mousse]]-like consistency, considered one of [[Cambodia]]'s [[national dish]]es. Fish amok is believed to have been a [[Khmer royal cuisine|royal Khmer dish]] dating back to the [[Khmer Empire]],<ref name="Gillan">{{cite magazine |last=Gillan |first=Audrey |title=Cambodia: the art of amok |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/2017/09/cambodia-art-amok |date=7 September 2017 |magazine=[[National Geographic]] |accessdate=4 October 2019 |archive-date=18 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210918204505/https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/2017/09/cambodia-art-amok |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Dunston">{{cite web |last=Dunston |first=Lara |title=Cambodian Fish Amok Recipe – an Authentic Steamed Fish Curry in the Old Style |url=https://grantourismotravels.com/cambodian-fish-amok-recipe/ |website=Grantourismo Travels |date=23 May 2017 |accessdate=4 October 2019 |archive-date=17 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220617161029/https://grantourismotravels.com/cambodian-fish-amok-recipe/ |url-status=live }}</ref> although some question it originating in Cambodia.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lees |first=Phil |date=May 25, 2007 |title=The Dish: Fish Amok |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117977402584509841 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=7 October 2019 |quote=The origins of fish amok are a source of regional debate. Dishes of this kind aren't unique to Cambodia. Malaysia and Indonesia boast the similar otak otak and Thailand cooks a spicier hor mok but neither nation embraces them with the passion of Cambodia. "Amok" in the Cambodian language, Khmer, only refers to the dish whereas in Thai, "hor mok" translates as "bury wrap," suggesting amok may have come from Cambodia's neighbor. |archive-date=2 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211102145158/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117977402584509841 |url-status=live }}</ref> It is slightly spicy. It also contains a variety of spices chili, turmeric (Madras & Alleppey), garlic, ginger, paprika, cumin, coriander seed, galangal, kaffir lime leaf, kenchur, black pepper, lemon myrtle leaf. Amok Trei in English is Steamed Fish.

==Ingredients==
Usually, goby, [[Snakehead (fish)|snakehead]] or [[catfish]] is used; however, they are also sometimes substituted with [[cod]], [[Lutjanidae|snapper]], [[barramundi]], [[Salmon as food|salmon]], [[whiting (fish)|whiting]], or [[perch]]. The fish [[fillet (cut)|fillets]] are rubbed with or marinated in a freshly-made [[yellow kroeung|yellow]] or [[green kroeung|green ''kroeung'']]<ref name="Dunston"/> mixed with [[coconut cream]] or [[coconut milk]] and [[egg as food|eggs]]. The curry mixture is placed in a banana leaf container with [[great morinda]] leaves at the bottom and steamed for around 20 to 30 minutes until the curry achieves a mousse-like consistency.<ref name="Dunston"/> Great morinda leaves can also be substituted with [[Swiss chard]] leaves if not available.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rivière |first1=Joannès |authorlink1=Joannès Rivière |date=2008 |title=Cambodian Cooking: A humanitarian project in collaboration with Act for Cambodia |publisher=[[Periplus Editions]] |page=55 |isbn=978-0-794-65039-1}}</ref>

Fish amok is served hot usually in either banana leaf containers or coconut shells and eaten with [[steamed rice]].<ref name="Dunston"/>
Many restaurants in Cambodia also serve less traditional versions of amok with [[Chicken as food|chicken]], [[tofu]], or [[beef]] instead of fish. Other deviations include the use of a store-bought herb paste, other types of ''kroeung'', more liquid consistency and cooking instead of steaming.<ref>{{cite web |last=Carter |first=Terence |title=Ruining Amok, The Corruption of Cambodia's National Dish |url=https://grantourismotravels.com/ruining-amok-cambodias-national-dish/ |website=Grantourismo Travels |date=21 April 2016 |accessdate=7 October 2019 |archive-date=15 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211115235117/https://grantourismotravels.com/ruining-amok-cambodias-national-dish/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
