Originally called didžkukuliai, or dumb-bells, they were renamed modishly in honour of Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, pioneer of the rigid airship, in 1900. Cepelinai shape resembles of a [[Zeppelin|Zeppelin airship]],.<ref name="Jacob Ashkenazi 2014 p. 793"/> Cepelinai are typically around 10–30&nbsp;cm long, although the size depends on where they are made: in the western [[Subdivisions of Lithuania|counties]] of Lithuania cepelinai are made bigger than in the east.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} In [[Samogitia]] cepelinai are called ''cepelinā''.

After boiling, the ''cepelinai'' are often served with [[sour cream]] sauce and [[bacon]] bits<ref name="Jacob Ashkenazi 2014 p. 793"/> or [[pork rind]]s.
