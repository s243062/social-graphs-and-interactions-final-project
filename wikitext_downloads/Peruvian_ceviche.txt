United Kingdom: Taylor & Francis Group, 2020.</ref> is a traditional dish widely eaten in [[Peru]] especially in the coastal region of the country. Ceviche is made and eaten throughout the whole year, but mostly served in the summer due to its refreshing and cold taste. It is also consumed for celebrations such as [[Fiestas Patrias (Peru)|Fiestas Patrias]].<ref name=":1">Levin, Amelia. “Peruvian Cuisine.” ''Foodservice Equipment & Supplies'' 67, no. 10 (2014): 16.</ref> The national plate can be considered different from other countries due to its distinct and unique preparation that contains lime juice, fish, sweet potatoes and other foods. 

In 2004, ceviche was declared to be part of Peru's "national heritage" and till this day, it continues being a holiday celebrated in its honor every June 28th.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.livinginperu.com/news/12547 |title=Peru this Week |publisher=Livinginperu.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}</ref> These achievements are attributed to different factors including UNESCO recognizing ceviche as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity on December of 2023. This was a great transformation of ceviche turning into a luxury due to scarcity,<ref name=":0" /> considering a Peruvian gastronomic boom led by gastropolitical elites who brought ceviche outside of Latin America.<ref name=":2">Irons, Rebecca. “Ceviche Revolution: Coastal Cholera, Marine Microplastics, and (Re)Fashioning Identities in Postcolonial Peruvian Gastropolitics.” ''Gastronomica'' 22, no. 4 (2022): 10–19.</ref> This growing global popularity of the dish has contributed to an even greater sense of pride in the national cuisine among Peruvians across the world.<ref>Treleaven, Sarah. “Alpaca.

==History==

Very little is known about the origin of ceviche, but there are some references attributing the Peruvian ceviche to a mix of inputs, including [[European cuisine]] and [[Andean cuisine]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gaviria|first1=Carolina|title=Ceviche Peruano|url=https://www.micocinaperuana.com/2013/09/receta-del-ceviche-peruano-gastronomia-peruana.html|website=Mi Cocina Peruana|publisher=MCP Internacional|accessdate=22 October 2016}}</ref> There is also a variety of historical anecdotes or legends surrounding the dish's creation. Some historians propose that Indigenous communities potentially utilized the extract from a passion fruit referred to as ''[[Passiflora tripartita|tumbo]]'' to preserve the plentiful seafood along the Pacific Coast, while other scholars theorize that a combination of saltwater, seaweed, and hot peppers might have been employed instead.<ref name=":4">Sharpe, Patricia. “Worth Its Stripes: A Love Letter to Peruvian Ceviche, Leche de Tigre Is One of San Antonio's Most Compelling New Restaurants.” ''Texas Monthly'', July 2023.</ref> Others say Incas used herbs or ''[[chicha]]'' for the preservation of fish.<ref name=":1" /> They add that the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] and his associates in the fifteenth century, bringing citrus fruits to the [[New World]], allowed ceviche's gradual evolution.<ref name=":4" /> Among other theories, there is the belief that the Mochica culture was the first to prepare ceviche,<ref name=":0" /> that it was actually fisher slaves during the colonial period trying to end their hunger and malnutrition,<ref>Montilla Pacheco, Argenis de Jesús, Alisson Angelit Delgado Mera, and Víctor Hugo Rivadeneira Sabando. “Estudio Del Consumo de Ceviche En La Ciudad de Manta y Su Contribución al Turismo.” ''RECUS'' 7, no. 2 (2022): 67–73.</ref> or even that it came from the Philippines.<ref name=":5">Vilchis, Jaime. “El Ceviche: Una Receta y Un Cuento.” ''Diálogo'' 18, no. 1 (2015): 163–164.</ref> 

== Preparation and variants ==
The classic Peruvian ceviche is composed of chunks of raw [[Fish (food)|fish]], [[Marination|marinated]] in freshly squeezed [[key lime]] or [[bitter orange]] (''naranja agria'') juice, with sliced onions, [[chili pepper]]s, salt and pepper. [[Cilus gilberti|Corvina]] or cebo ([[sea bass]]) was the fish traditionally used. The mixture was traditionally marinated for several hours and served at room temperature, with chunks of [[corn-on-the-cob]], and slices of cooked [[sweet potato]]. 

Regional or contemporary variations include garlic, fish bone broth, minced Peruvian ''ají limo'', or the Andean chili ''[[rocoto]]'', toasted corn or ''cancha'' ([[corn nut]]) and ''yuyo'' ([[Edible seaweed|seaweed]]). A specialty of [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]] is ceviche prepared from [[shark]] (''tollo'' or ''tojo''). ''Lenguado'' ([[Sole (fish)|sole]]) is often used in [[Lima]]. The ingredients that characterize these regional variations are chosen depending on the natural features of the landscape, most are local ingredients that can be cultivated or found within the region.<ref name=":1" />

Most Peruvian ''cevicherías'' serve a small glass of marinade (as an appetizer) along with the fish, which is called ''leche de tigre'' or ''leche de pantera'', "tiger's milk" or "panther's milk," respectively. It is a milky white, finely blended, and strained mix of lime juice, raw fish, red onion, garlic, cilantro stems, celery, and ginger.<ref name=":4" /> This appetizer differentiates Peruvian ceviche from other styles in Latin America.

Among these other popular presentations are the Mexican-style ceviche, which includes fish marinated in lime juice and tossed with ''[[pico de gallo]]'', baked potato, and parsley;<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":5" /> the Colombian-style one, that features Corvina with lime juice, avocado, and coconut milk;<ref name=":6">Schwaner-Albright, Oliver. “Bathing Beauty.” ''The New York Times Magazine'', March 2008.</ref> and the Ecuadorian one, which includes shrimp with onion, lemon juice, and cilantro with ''[[chifle]]'' as side.<ref>Duarte-Casar, Rodrigo, Jessica Robalino-Vallejo, María Fernanda Buzetta-Ricaurte, and Marlene Rojas-Le-Fort. “Toward a Characterization of Ecuadorian Ceviche: Much More than Shrimp.” ''Journal of Ethnic Foods'' 9, no. 1 (2022): 1–12.</ref>

The modern version of Peruvian ceviche, which is similar to the method used in making Japanese [[sashimi]], consists of fish marinated in citrus juice for about 45 minutes and served promptly.<ref name=":6" /> It was developed in the 1970s by Peruvian-Japanese chefs including Dario Matsufuji and Humberto Sato.<ref>{{cite web |last=Solari |first=Carola |title=Peruano + japonés |url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=es&u=http://www.paula.cl/reportaje/nikkei-peruano-japones/&prev=/search%3Fq%3Dhumberto%2Bsato%2Bdario%2Bmatsufuji%26num%3D30%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26rlz%3D1C1CHKZ_enUS434US434&sa=X&ei=fT5DUcWqK7HK4AOm9oGYBA&ved=0CEQQ7gEwAQ |accessdate=15 March 2013 |work=Paula.cl}}</ref> Some elite restaurants employ a rapid-marinade technique instead, a citrus bath of only five minutes which elite chefs believe to be perfect to get the "best flavor."<ref name=":2" /> However, experts suggest a marinade time of a minimum of 15 minutes in order to kill all bacteria present in the seafood.<ref name=":2" />
