'''Quzi''' ({{langx|ar|قوزي}}), also spelled as '''qoozi''' or '''ghoozi''', is a popular rice-based dish and is considered one of [[Iraqi cuisine|Iraq's national dishes]].

== Variations == 
In [[Iraqi cuisine]], it is usually prepared by stuffing a whole lamb with rice, vegetables, spices and nuts and slow-cooking it over a closed or submerged oven.<ref name=ES-2015 /> In some places in the Middle East it is buried in a pit containing burning coal or charcoal to get the smoky flavor.

There are many variations to this technique such as in [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Yemen]], where it is called ''madfoon'', cooked by being wrapped in aluminium foil and kept on an open heat source. In [[Oman]] and [[UAE]] it is called ''shuwaa'' and is traditionally eaten on festive occasions, prepared by wrapping the marinated meat in date palm leaves and placing the wrapped meat in a submerged oven.

In [[Jordan]], and [[Syria]] it is known as ''zarb''; the meat is portioned into smaller pieces and kept along with vegetables and bread dough so that the flavors are enhanced.{{citation needed|date=June 2025}} Some versions in the Levant use chicken next to or in place of lamb.<ref name="Aksalser" /><ref>{{cite news |title=أرز الأوزي بالدجاج على طريقة منال العالم |url=https://www.alwatanvoice.com/arabic/news/2023/05/28/1523164.html |access-date=29 October 2025 |work=Alwatan |date=28 May 2023 |language=ar |trans-title=Chicken Ouzi Rice, Manal Al-Alam Style}}</ref>

Another version popular in Jordan and Syria uses ground lamb meat instead of whole lamb, sometimes presented as a pilaf with carrots and peas,<ref name="kassis" /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Gorsky |first1=Faith |title=Lamb Ouzi Rice |url=https://www.anediblemosaic.com/lamb-ouzi-rice/ |website=An Edible Mosaic™ |access-date=16 June 2025 |date=6 November 2024}}</ref> originally, this was used as the filling for ''surar ouzi'' ({{langx|apc|صرر أوزي|translation=ouzi pouches}}<ref name="MEMO"/>), which are parcels of thin dough that are stuffed and baked, but contemporary versions call the stuffing itself "ouzi".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Atassi |first1=Anas |title=Sumac: Recipes and stories from Syria |date=2 March 2021 |publisher=Murdoch Books |isbn=978-1-76106-170-7 |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Sumac/v_gLEAAAQBAJ |access-date=29 October 2025}}</ref><ref name="kassis" /> It is especially popular in Syria, and often served for special occasions like weddings or to guests.<ref name="MEMO">{{cite news |title=Ouzi surar |url=https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20170430-ouzi-surar/ |access-date=29 October 2025 |work=Middle East Monitor |date=30 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=رغيف خبز يحمل كنوز الشام.. ما هو أصل الأوزي؟ |url=https://arabic.cnn.com/travel/video/2019/07/30/v77747-asl-w-fasl-ouzi |access-date=29 October 2025 |work=CNN Arabic |date=30 July 2019 |language=ar |trans-title=A loaf of bread that carries the treasures of the Levant...

Another variant is called ''[[haneeth]]'' where it is cooked inside a hot [[Tabun oven|''tabun'']]; this variation can be found in most Middle Eastern countries as well as the Horn of Africa and North Africa.
