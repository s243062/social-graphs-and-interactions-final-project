A '''croissant''' ({{IPAc-en|k|r|ə|ˈ|s|ɑː|n|t|,_|ˈ|k|(|r|)|w|æ|s|ɒ̃}};<ref>Merriam-Webster Unabridged; Oxford dictionary of pronunciation for current English.</ref> {{IPA|fr|kʁwasɑ̃|lang|fr-croissant.ogg}}) is a [[French cuisine|French]] [[Viennoiserie]] in a crescent shape made from a laminated yeast dough that sits between a [[bread]] and a [[puff pastry]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Davidson |first=Alan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bIIeBQAAQBAJ&dq=culinary+mythology+viennoiserie&pg=PA46 |title=The Oxford Companion to Food |date=2014-08-21 |publisher=OUP Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-104072-6 |page=232 and 237 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zqYIEQAAQBAJ&dq=viennoiserie+pain+au+raisin&pg=PA51|title=Handbook of Molecular Gastronomy.Scientific Foundations, Educational Practices, and Culinary Applications|date=2021|author=Alan L.

Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the [[Renaissance]], and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since [[Late antiquity|antiquity]].<ref>{{cite book | title = "Qu'est-ce que la Bible? d'après la nouvelle philosophie allemande", translated by August Hermann Ewerbeck | year = 1850| page = 327 | quote = Hebrew women, in the time of Jeremiah, made in honor of the pagan goddess [[Astarte]] (queen of heaven, queen of the moon) cakes, probably in the form of a crescent.}}</ref> The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century, when [[France|French]] bakers replaced the brioche dough of the ''kipferl'' with a yeast-leavened laminated dough.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Fiegl |first1=Amanda |title=Is the Croissant Really French? |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/croissant-really-french-180955130/ |access-date=2022-04-26 |website=Smithsonian Magazine |archive-date=25 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220625150036/https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/croissant-really-french-180955130/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, [[frozen food|frozen]], preformed but unbaked dough made them into a [[fast food]] that could be freshly baked by [[unskilled labor]]. The croissant bakery, notably the ''La Croissanterie'' chain, was a French response to American-style fast food,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,924419,00.html |title= Living: Croissant Vite |author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=|publisher= TIME Magazine (Monday, Sept. 08, 1980) |access-date=October 31, 2025 |url-status=dead

Croissants are a common part of a [[continental breakfast]] in many European countries.

==Origin and history==
The ''[[Kifli|kipferl]]'', an Austrian crescent-shaped pastry, can be dated back to at least the 13th century in Austria, and came in various shapes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://germazope.uni-trier.de/Projects/WBB/woerterbuecher/dwb/wbgui?lemmode=lemmasearch&mode=hierarchy&textsize=600&onlist=&word=Kipferl&lemid=GK05212&query_start=1&totalhits=0&textword=&locpattern=&textpattern=&lemmapattern=&verspattern=#GK05212L0|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001041721/http://germazope.uni-trier.de/Projects/WBB/woerterbuecher/dwb/wbgui?lemmode=lemmasearch&mode=hierarchy&textsize=600&onlist=&word=Kipferl&lemid=GK05212&query_start=1&totalhits=0&textword=&locpattern=&textpattern=&lemmapattern=&verspattern=#GK05212L0|url-status=dead|title=Wörterbuchnetz|archive-date=1 October 2015|website=germazope.uni-trier.de}}</ref><ref name=":6">{{Cite web |date=2023-01-30 |title=A Brief History of the Croissant {{!}} Institute of Culinary Education |url=https://www.ice.edu/blog/brief-history-croissant |access-date=2024-01-09 |website=www.ice.edu |language=en}}</ref> The ''kipferl'' can be made plain or with nuts or other fillings (some consider the [[rugelach]] a form of ''kipferl'').<ref name="Alto">{{cite web |last1=Hartley |first1=Alto |title=A Brief History of the Croissant |url=https://altohartley.com/a-brief-history-of-the-croissant/ |website=Alto Hartley |date=16 January 2019 |access-date=16 June 2019 |archive-date=16 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190616195239/https://altohartley.com/a-brief-history-of-the-croissant/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In either 1838 or 1839, an Austrian artillery officer, [[August Zang]], founded a Viennese bakery ("Boulangerie Viennoise") at 92, rue de Richelieu in Paris.<ref name=":6" /><ref>The 1839 date, and most of what follows, is documented in Jim Chevallier, ''August Zang and the French Croissant: How Viennoiserie Came to France'', p. 3–30; for the 1838 date, see [http://www.slowfood.fr/bulletin/Diner_BS_PNY_2409_discours.pdf Giles MacDonogh "Reflections on the Third Meditation of La Physiologie du goût and Slow Food"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303175218/http://www.slowfood.fr/bulletin/Diner_BS_PNY_2409_discours.pdf |date=3 March 2016 }} (p. 8); an Austrian PowerPoint – [http://www.oberoesterreich-tourismus.at/sixcms/media.php/1271/sandgruber_mahlzeiten.pdf Ess-Stile] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529221535/http://www.oberoesterreich-tourismus.at/sixcms/media.php/1271/sandgruber_mahlzeiten.pdf |date=29 May 2012 }}&nbsp;– gives the date of 1840 (slide 46). A 1909 image of the bakery shows the same date for its founding, but the bakery was already documented in the press before that.</ref> This bakery, which served Viennese specialties including the ''kipferl'' and the [[Vienna bread|Vienna loaf]], quickly became popular and inspired French imitators (and the concept, if not the term, of ''[[viennoiserie]]''). The French version of the ''kipferl'' was named for its crescent (''croissant'') shape and has become a universally identifiable shape across the world.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The earliest known recipe for the present-day croissant appears in 1905, although the name croissant appears among the "fantasy or luxury breads" in 1853.<ref>Phillip and Mary Hyman, "Croissant", in ''The Oxford Companion to Food'', 3rd edition (2014), edited by [[Alan Davidson (food writer)|Alan Davidson]] and [[Tom Jaine]].</ref> Earlier recipes for non-laminated croissants can be found in the 19th century and at least one reference to croissants as an established French bread appeared as early as 1850.<ref>''Académie d'agriculture de France'', Mémoires (Paris: Bouchard-Huzard, 1850) First Part, p.&nbsp;588.</ref>

Zang himself returned to Austria in 1848 to become a press magnate, but the bakery remained popular for some time afterwards, and was mentioned in several works of the time: "This same M. Zank {{sic}}...founded around 1830 [sic], in Paris, the famous Boulangerie viennoise".<ref>"Revue Moderne" or "Revue Germanique", 1861, p. 80.</ref> Several sources praise this bakery's products: "Paris is of exquisite delicacy; and, in particular, the succulent products of the Boulangerie Viennoise";<ref>Chambers' Edinburgh Journal, 1847, p. 254.</ref> "which seemed to us as fine as if it came from the Viennese bakery on the [[rue de Richelieu]]".<ref>Théophile Gautier, "Voyage en Russie", Charpentier, 1867, p. 188.</ref>

By 1869, the croissant was well established enough to be mentioned as a breakfast staple,<ref>"Nouvelle revue théologique", Casterman, 1869, p. 161.</ref> and in 1872, [[Charles Dickens]] wrote (in his periodical ''[[All the Year Round]]'') of "the workman's ''pain de ménage'' and the soldier's ''pain de munition'', to the dainty croissant on the boudoir table".<ref>"The Cupboard papers: VIII. The Sweet Art", 30 November 1872.</ref>

The [[viennoiserie]] technique that now characterizes the croissant was already mentioned in the late 17th century, when [[François Pierre La Varenne|La Varenne's]] ''Le Cuisinier françois'' gave a recipe for it in the 1680 – and possibly earlier – edition. It was typically used not on its own but for shells holding other ingredients (as in a [[vol-au-vent]]). It does not appear to be mentioned in relation to the croissant until the 20th century.

The first recipe corresponding to the modern croissant, not only for the shape but also the texture of the dough and the taste, was published in 1906, in [[Paris]], in Colombié's ''Nouvelle Encyclopédie culinaire.''<ref>{{Cite book |last=Davidson |first=Alan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bIIeBQAAQBAJ&dq=culinary+mythology+viennoiserie&pg=PA46 |title=The Oxford Companion to Food |date=2014-08-21 |publisher=OUP Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-104072-6 |language=en}}</ref>

===Culinary legends===
[[File:Kifli.jpg|thumb|A ''kipferl'', a precursor to croissants]]
Stories of how the ''kipferl'' – sometimes confused with the croissant – was created are widespread and persistent culinary legends, going back to the 19th century.<ref name="schimmer">Karl August Schimmer, The Sieges of Vienna by the Turks: Translated from the German of Karl August Schimmer and Others, trans. Earl of Francis Egerton Ellesmere (London: John Murray, 1879), p. 30–31.</ref> However, there are no contemporary sources for any of these stories, and an aristocratic writer, writing in 1799, does not mention the ''kipferl'' in a long and extensive list of breakfast foods.<ref>Mme. de Genlis, "Manuel de Voyage", Berlin, P. T. de Lagarde, 1799, pp. 54–56.</ref>

The legends include tales that it was invented in Europe to celebrate the defeat of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] forces by the [[Franks]] at the [[Battle of Tours]] in 732, with the shape representing the Islamic [[crescent]]; that it was invented in [[Buda]]; or, according to other sources, in [[Vienna, Austria|Vienna]] in 1683 to celebrate the defeat of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] by Christian forces in the [[Battle of Vienna|siege of the city]], as a reference to the crescents on the [[Ottoman flag]]s, when bakers staying up all night heard the tunneling operation and gave the alarm.<ref name="schimmer"/><ref>{{Cite news |last=Letters |date=2016-02-23 |title=A short history of the croissant shows it's Viennese, not French |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/23/a-short-history-of-the-croissant-shows-its-viennese-not-french |access-date=2024-11-11 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

The Islamic origin story seems to have originated with the 20th-century writer Alfred Gottschalk, who gave two versions:<ref name="Gottschalk1948">{{cite book|last=Gottschalk|first=Alfred|title=Histoire de l'alimentation et de la gastronomie depuis la préhistoire jusqua'à nos jours: Illus. documentaires|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zDhEAAAAYAAJ|year=1948|publisher=Editions Hippocrate|language=fr|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216033508/https://books.google.com/books?id=zDhEAAAAYAAJ|archive-date=16 February 2017}}</ref>

{{blockquote|According to one of a group of similar legends, which vary only in detail, a baker of the 17th century, working through the night at a time when his city (either Vienna in 1683 or Budapest in 1686) was under siege by the Turks, heard faint underground rumbling sounds which, on investigation, proved to be caused by a Turkish attempt to invade the city by tunneling under the walls. The tunnel was blown up. The baker asked no reward other than the exclusive right to bake crescent-shaped pastries commemorating the incident, the crescent being the symbol of Islam. He was duly rewarded in this way, and the croissant was born.<br>The story seems to owe its origin, or at least its wide diffusion, to Alfred Gottschalk, who wrote about the croissant for the first edition of the ''Larousse Gastronomique'' (1938) and there gave the legend in the 'Turkish attack on Budapest in 1686' version; but who subsequently, in his own book (1948) on the history of food, opted for the 'siege of Vienna in 1683' version.<ref>{{cite book |title=Oxford Companion to Food |url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00davi_0 |url-access=registration |first=Alan |last=Davidson |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1999 |page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00davi_0/page/232 232] |isbn=978-0-19-211579-9 }} via {{cite web |url=http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodbreads.html#croissants |title=Croissants |work=[[The Food Timeline]] |first=Lynne |last=Olver |author-link=Lynne Olver |access-date=29 March 2016 |archive-date=25 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925071709/http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodbreads.html#croissants |url-status=live }}</ref>||''[[Oxford Companion to Food]]''|source=''s.v.''

For this reason, the [[Islamic State]] attempted to ban croissants during the [[Syrian civil war]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Groden|first=Claire|title=Syrian Rebels Ban Croissants in Aleppo |url=https://newsfeed.time.com/2013/08/02/syrian-rebels-ban-croissants-in-aleppo/|access-date=9 August 2013|newspaper=Time|date=2 August 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807001231/http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/08/02/syrian-rebels-ban-croissants-in-aleppo/|archive-date=7 August 2013}}</ref>

==Variants==
{{More citations needed section|date=August 2019}}
[[File:APileOfCroissants.jpg|thumb|Baked croissants]]
Uncooked croissant dough can also be wrapped around any [[Praline (nut confection)|praline]], [[almond paste]], or [[chocolate]] before it is baked (in the last case, it becomes like ''[[pain au chocolat]]'', which has a different, non-crescent, shape), or sliced to include sweet or [[wikt:savory|savoury]] fillings. It may be flavored with dried fruit such as [[Sultana (grape)|sultanas]] or [[raisins]], or other fruits such as [[apple]]s. In France and Spain, croissants are generally sold without filling and eaten without added butter, but sometimes with [[almond]] filling.

In the [[United States]], sweet fillings or toppings are sometimes used, and warm croissants may be filled with [[ham]] and [[cheese]], or [[feta cheese]] and [[spinach]]. In the [[Levant]], croissants are sold plain or filled with chocolate, cheese, almonds, or [[zaatar]]. In [[Germany]], croissants are sometimes filled with [[Nutella]] or [[persipan]]; in southern Germany, there is also a popular variety of a croissant glazed with [[lye]] [[Lye roll|(''Laugencroissant'')]]. In the German-speaking part of [[Switzerland]], the croissant is typically called a ''Gipfeli''; this usually has a crisper crust and is less buttery than the French-style croissant.

===Argentina and Uruguay===
Croissants are commonly served alongside coffee for breakfast, ''aperitivo'' (a light mid-morning meal), or ''[[merienda]]'' (a mid-afternoon meal). They are referred to as ''medialunas'' ("half moons") because of their shape and are typically coated with a sweet glaze (''medialunas de manteca'', "half moons of butter"). Another variant is a ''medialuna de grasa'' ("half moon of lard"), which is not always sweet.

===Italy===
A cousin of the croissant is the [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] ''[[Cornetto (pastry)|cornetto]]'' (in the [[Central Italy|center]] and [[Southern Italy|south]]) or [[brioche]] (in the [[Northern Italy|north]]). These variants are often considered to be the same, but that is not completely true: the French version tends to be crispy, whereas an Italian ''cornetto'' or brioche is usually softer. Furthermore, the ''cornetto vuoto'' ({{literally|empty ''cornetto''}}) is commonly accompanied by variants with filling, which include ''crema pasticciera'' ([[custard]]), [[apricot jam]] or [[chocolate]] cream. They often come covered with [[powdered sugar]] or other toppings. ''Cornetto'' with [[cappuccino]] at the bar is one of the most common [[breakfast]]s in Italy.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}

===Poland===
[[File:Rogale świętomarcińskie RB1.JPG|thumb|[[St. Martin's croissant]] from [[Poznań]], Poland]]
On 11 November, St. Martin's Day is celebrated in the Polish region of [[Greater Poland]], mainly in its capital city [[Poznań]]. On this day, the people of Poznań purchase and eat considerable amounts of sweet, crescent-shaped pastries called ''rogale świętomarcińskie'' ("[[St. Martin's croissant]]s"). They are made specially for this occasion from puff pastry filled with ground white poppy seeds, almonds, raisins, and nuts.

===Portugal===
The first type of Portuguese croissant is similar to the French, and can be plain or filled with custard, chocolate, fruit jam, or a typical Portuguese cream made of egg yolk and sugar, "doce de ovo". It is customary for these to also have powdered sugar on top. The second version has a similar consistency to [[brioche]] and is commonly eaten with ham and cheese. Sometimes this type is also served like toast, with a spread of butter. While the first type of croissant is considered sweet and is eaten during breakfast or tea, the second type is a more filling meal and is usually considered a sandwich and often prepared for picnics or as travel food. Both types share the same name (French/Portuguese: "croissant") but are typically found in different bakeries: the sweet croissant is more commonly found in Portuguese pâtisseries and the brioche croissant is usually found in coffeehouses.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

===Turkey===
A pastry with croissant shape is the Turkish ''ay çöreği''. It is filled with [[cinnamon]], [[walnut]], [[hazelnut]], [[cacao bean|cacao]] and [[raisin]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Pastane Ay Çöreği |date=2014-10-23 |url=http://www.nefisyemektarifleri.com/pastane-ay-coregi/ |access-date=2016-12-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220120510/http://www.nefisyemektarifleri.com/pastane-ay-coregi/ |archive-date=20 December 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> Its rectangular shape variant is known as ''pastiç'' or ''İzmir çöreği''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nefisyemektarifleri.com/izmir-coregi-pastic/ |title=İzmir Çöreği (Pastiç) |access-date=2016-12-11 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220121112/http://www.nefisyemektarifleri.com/izmir-coregi-pastic/ |archive-date=20 December 2016 |date=2016-02-14 }}</ref> It is generally eaten during breakfast or with tea.

==Overview of manufacturing==
[[File:Croissant rising.jpg|thumb|Croissant rising]]
The first step of manufacturing croissants is the "predough" formation. To prepare predough, flour, water, in-dough fat, yeast, salt, and sugar are mixed together in a single step.<ref name=":0" /> Typically, croissant predough is mixed in a relatively cool environment, for a longer time than other [[Pastry|pastries]]. The ideal temperature of the dough should be around {{convert|19|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, to best hydrate the ingredients.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bakeinfo.co.nz/Ask-Us/Library/Information-Sheets|title=Information Sheets |publisher=Baking Industry Research Trust |website=www.bakeinfo.co.nz|access-date=2016-12-14|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220164457/http://www.bakeinfo.co.nz/Ask-Us/Library/Information-Sheets|archive-date=20 December 2016}}</ref> In comparison to the mixing of bread dough ingredients, pastry predough is considered underdeveloped in that mixing is stopped as soon as the dough appears homogeneous, to allow for further dough development in the next step.<ref name=":0" />

The second step is the [[Laminated dough|lamination]] process. Lamination is necessary to produce multilayered dough with alternating layers of predough and fat. Generally, there are two methods for folding fat into the dough: the English method and the French method. In the English method, one fold results in two fat layers and three dough layers.<ref name=":5" /> After spreading out predough, roll-in fat is flattened to a similar thickness as the predough and spread over two-thirds of the surface of the laminated predough. The exposed third of predough is then folded over half of the roll-in fat, while the other end (one predough and one fat layer) is folded on top. In the French method, one fold results in one fat layer and two dough layers. After spreading out the predough and putting a layer of roll-in fat over the center surface of the dough, the corners of the predough are folded toward the middle of the fat. Croissant dough is typically laminated until 16–50 fat layers are obtained.<ref name=":0" /> The optimal number of layers can be determined by balancing certain crumb properties with specific volume. On one hand, a low number of layers yields large specific heights as well as irregular crumb structure with large voids. On the other hand, a large number of relatively thin layers leads to interconnections between different dough layers as well as less dough lift.

After lamination, the dough is formed into its famous [[crescent]] shape. First, the laminated dough is cut into triangles of the desired size. The triangles are then rolled with three-and-a-half to four full turns, and finally, the ends of the roll are curved inwards to form a crescent.<ref name=":4" />

The third step is the [[fermentation]] process. Croissants are different from other puff pastries in that they include yeast, which, during proofing, increases the dough volume. Ideally, the optimum croissant quality is achieved at a yeast level of 7.5%, with a proof time of 60 minutes at {{convert|31|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.<ref name=":5" /> The croissants are finished proofing when the dough has expanded by two-and-a-half times its original volume.<ref name=":4" />

The fourth step is the baking process. Also known as "pastry lift" or "dough lift", the dough expands as water is converted to [[steam]], thus increasing the pressure between each dough layer. As a result, the croissant dough rises up to yield its characteristic flaky texture.<ref name=":0" /> Depending on the type of oven used and specific size of the croissant, the baking time can range from 10 to 20 minutes and the oven temperature can be set anywhere from {{convert|165|to|205|C|F}}.<ref name=":4" />

The final steps are the cooling and storage of the croissant. Croissants are generally not stored for very long and are typically consumed soon after baking.

==Ingredient functionality during processing==

===Predough===
[[Gluten]] proteins affect the water absorption and [[Viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] properties of the predough.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Ooms|first1=Nand|last2=Pareyt|first2=Bram|last3=Brijs|first3=Kristof|last4=Delcour|first4=Jan A.|date=2016-10-02|title=Ingredient Functionality in Multilayered Dough-margarine Systems and the Resultant Pastry Products: A Review|journal=Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition|volume=56|issue=13|pages=2101–2114|doi=10.1080/10408398.2014.928259|issn=1040-8398|pmid=26177127|s2cid=566664}}</ref> The role of proteins can be divided into two stages of dough formation: hydration and deformation. In the hydration stage, gluten proteins absorb water up to two times their own weight. In the deformation or kneading stage, the action of mixing causes the gluten to undergo a series of polymerization and depolymerization reactions, forming a viscoelastic network. Hydrated [[glutenin]] proteins in particular help form a polymeric protein network that makes the dough more cohesive. On the other hand, hydrated [[gliadin]] proteins do not directly form the network, but do act as plasticizers of the glutenin network, thus imparting fluidity to the dough’s viscosity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wieser|first=Herbert|date=2007-04-01|title=Chemistry of gluten proteins|journal=Food Microbiology|volume=24|issue=2|pages=115–119|doi=10.1016/j.fm.2006.07.004|issn=0740-0020|pmid=17008153}}</ref>

[[Starch]] also affects the viscosity of predough. At room temperature and in a sufficient amount of water, intact starch granules can absorb water up to 50% of their own dry weight, causing them to swell to a limited extent.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last1=Goesaert|first1=H.|last2=Brijs|first2=K.|last3=Veraverbeke|first3=W.

A.|date=2005-01-01|title=Wheat flour constituents: how they impact bread quality, and how to impact their functionality|journal=Trends in Food Science & Technology|series=Second International Symposium on Sourdough: From Fundamentals to Applications|volume=16|issue=1–3|pages=12–30|doi=10.1016/j.tifs.2004.02.011}}</ref> The slightly swollen granules are found in the spaces between the [[gluten]] network, thus contributing to the consistency of the dough. The granules may not be intact, as the process of [[Milling (machining)|milling]] wheat into flour damages some of the starch granules. Given that damaged starch granules have the capacity to absorb around three times as much water as undamaged starch, the use of flour with higher levels of damaged starch requires the addition of more water to achieve optimal dough development and consistency.<ref name=":0" />

Water content affects the mechanical behavior of predough.<ref name=":0" /> As previously discussed, water is absorbed by gluten and starch granules to increase the [[viscosity]] of the dough. The temperature of the water is also important as it determines the temperature of the predough. In order to facilitate processing, cold water should be used for two main reasons. First, chilled water provides a desirable environment for gluten development, as the temperature at which mixing occurs impacts the dough’s hydration time, consistency, and required amount of mixing energy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=Weining|last2=Kim|first2=Yangsoo|last3=Li|first3=Xianyu|last4=Rayas-Duarte|first4=Patricia|date=2008-11-01|title=Rheofermentometer parameters and bread specific volume of frozen sweet dough influenced by ingredients and dough mixing temperature|journal=Journal of Cereal Science|volume=48|issue=3|pages=639–646|doi=10.1016/j.jcs.2008.02.008}}</ref> Secondly, cold water is comparable to the temperature of the roll-in fat to be added later, which better facilitates the latter’s incorporation.<ref name=":0" />

In-dough fat affects the texture and lift of predough. Although higher levels of dough fat may lower dough lift during baking, it also correlates with a softer end product.<ref name=":0" /> As such, the main function of in-dough fat is to produce a desirable softness in the final croissant.

===Lamination===
In [[Laminated dough|laminated]] croissant dough, the gluten network is not continuous. Instead, the gluten proteins are separated as thin gluten films between dough layers. The formation of thin, well-defined layers affects the height of dough lift. Generally, laminated croissant dough contains fewer layers than other puff pastry doughs that do not contain yeast, due to the presence of small bubbles in the gluten sheets. Upon proofing, these bubbles expand and destroy the integrity of the dough layers.<ref name=":5">{{Cite book|title=Technology of Breadmaking|last=Bent|first=Alan J.|date=2007-01-01|publisher=Springer US|isbn=9780387385631|pages=245–274|doi=10.1007/0-387-38565-7_9 |chapter=Speciality Fermented Goods}}</ref> The resulting interconnections between different dough layers would over-increase [[dough strength]] and allow water vapor to escape through micropores during baking, consequently decreasing dough lift. The role of fat also influences the separation of layers, as will be discussed next.

Roll-in fat affects the flakiness and flavor of the croissant. In [[laminated dough]], fat layers alternate with dough layers. As such, the most important function of roll-in fat is to form and maintain a barrier between the different dough layers during sheeting and folding.<ref name=":0" /> As previously stated, the ability for fat to maintain separation between folded dough layers ensures proper dough lift.

The type of roll-in fat used is typically [[butter]] or [[margarine]]. Butter and margarine are both water-in-oil [[emulsion]]s, composed of stabilized water droplets dispersed in oil.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=McClements |first=David Julian|date=2010-03-04|title=Emulsion Design to Improve the Delivery of Functional Lipophilic Components|journal=Annual Review of Food Science and Technology|volume=1|issue=1 |pages=241–269 |doi=10.1146/annurev.food.080708.100722|pmid=22129337|issn=1941-1413}}</ref> While butter is appealing due to its high consumer acceptance, its low melting point, {{convert|32|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, actually makes it undesirable for production purposes. The use of butter as roll-in fat during the lamination step will cause problems of oiling out during sheeting and fermentation if the temperature is not tightly controlled, thus disrupting the integrity of the layers.<ref name=":0" /> On the other hand, kinds of margarine are commonly used as roll-in fat because they facilitate dough handling. Generally, roll-in margarine should have a melting point between {{convert|40|and|44|C|F}}, at least {{convert|3|°C|°F|abbr=on}} higher than the fermentation temperature to prevent oiling out prior to baking. It is also important to consider the plasticity and firmness of the roll-in fat, which is largely determined by its solid fat content. Generally, a greater proportion of solid fat coincides with larger croissant lift.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Baked Products|url=https://archive.org/details/bakedproductssci00cauv|url-access=limited|date=2006 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |isbn=9780470995907 |editor-last=Cauvain|editor-first=Stanley P.|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bakedproductssci00cauv/page/n85 72]–98|doi=10.1002/9780470995907|editor-last2=Young|editor-first2=Linda S.|chapter = Ingredients and Their Influences}}</ref> At the same time, the roll-in fat should have plasticity comparable to that of the dough, such that the fat layers do not break during sheeting and folding.<ref name=":0" /> If the fat is firmer than the dough, then the dough can rupture. If the fat is softer than the dough, then it will succumb to the mechanical stress of sheeting and potentially migrate into the dough.

===Fermentation===
[[File:Croissant, cross section.jpg|thumb|Cross-section, showing texture]]
Croissants contain yeast, ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', which is incorporated during predough formation. When oxygen is abundant, the yeast breaks down sugar into carbon dioxide and water through the process of [[Cellular respiration|respiration]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bakeinfo.co.nz/Facts/Bread-making/Science-of-bread-making/Rising-fermentation-|title=Rising (fermentation) |publisher=Baking Industry Research Trust |website=www.bakeinfo.co.nz|access-date=2016-12-14|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220163539/http://www.bakeinfo.co.nz/Facts/Bread-making/Science-of-bread-making/Rising-fermentation-|archive-date=20 December 2016}}</ref> This process releases energy that is used by the yeast for growth. After consuming all of the oxygen, the yeast switches to anaerobic [[fermentation]]. At this point, the yeast partially breaks down sugar into [[ethanol]] and carbon dioxide. Once {{CO2}} saturates the dough’s aqueous phase, the gas begins to leaven the dough by diffusing to preexisting gas cells that were incorporated into the predough during mixing.<ref name=":0" /> Yeast action does not produce new gas cells, as the immense pressure required for a single {{CO2}} molecule to create a new gas bubble is not physically attainable.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of cereal science and technology|last=Carl|first=Hoseney, R.|date=2010-01-01|publisher=AACC International|oclc=457130408}}</ref>

In order to ensure the flaky texture of the croissant, it is important to balance the yeast activity with [[steam]] production. If the yeast overproduces {{CO2}}, then the well-defined layers may collapse.<ref name=":1" /> During the baking process, this would cause steam to escape too early from the bread, reducing dough lift and flakiness of the final product. Thus, to offset the negative effects of yeast on layer integrity and dough lift, croissants usually contain fewer layers than other puff pastries.

===Baking===
[[File:La parisienne unbaked croissant.jpg|thumb|Unbaked croissant dough]]
During baking, the transient [[gluten]] network turns into a permanent network.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Goesaert|first1=Hans|last2=Slade|first2=Louise|author-link2=Louise Slade|last3=Levine|first3=Harry|last4=Delcour|first4=Jan A.|date=2009-11-01|title=Amylases and bread firming – an integrated view|journal=Journal of Cereal Science|series=Special Section: Enzymes in Grain Processing|volume=50|issue=3|pages=345–352|doi=10.1016/j.jcs.2009.04.010}}</ref> At higher temperatures, intermolecular [[Disulfide|disulfide bonds]] form between glutenin molecules, as well as between [[gliadin]] and [[glutenin]]. With more bonds being made, the gluten network becomes more rigid, strengthening the croissant’s crumb texture. Additionally, the baking process significantly stretches the dough layers due to the large macroscopic deformation that occurred during fermentation’s dough lift.<ref name=":0" />

Starch undergoes [[Starch gelatinization|gelatinization]] as a result of baking.<ref name=":3" /> Prior to baking, starch granules absorb a small amount of water at room temperature as it is mixed with water to form predough. As long as the dough’s temperature stays under the gelatinization temperature, this granule swelling is limited and reversible. However, once the baking process begins and the dough is exposed to temperatures above the gelatinization temperature, [[amylopectin]] crystallites become more disordered inside the starch granules and cause an irreversible destruction of molecular order.<ref name=":0" /> At the same time, [[starch gelatinization]] actively draws water from the gluten network, further decreasing the flexibility of the gluten. Currently, the extent of [[amylose]] leaching and granular structure distortion during the baking of croissants is still unknown.

Roll-in fat gradually melts as the temperature in the oven increases. Some of the melting fat can migrate into the dough, which could then interfere with gluten protein crosslinking.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|last1=Sievert|first1=Dietmar|last2=Hoseney|first2=R. Carl|last3=Delcour|first3=Jan A.|date=2000|publisher=Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA|isbn=9783527306732 |doi=10.1002/14356007.a04_331.pub2|s2cid=137346105 }}</ref> The fat phase also contributes to dough lift through gas inflation, which will be described next.

Water is converted to [[steam]] during the baking process, which is the main factor behind the leavening of the dough. The water for steam production comes from both the dough layers and the roll-in fat. As the fat melts, the continuous oil phase is no longer able to stabilize the water droplets, which are then released and converted to steam.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Borwankar|first1=R. P.|last2=Frye|first2=L. A.|last3=Blaurock|first3=A. E. |last4=Sasevich|first4=F. J.|date=1992-01-01|title=Rheological characterization of melting of margarines and tablespreads|journal=Journal of Food Engineering|series=Rheology of Foods|volume=16|issue=1|pages=55–74|doi=10.1016/0260-8774(92)90020-7}}</ref> Although the exact mechanism of steam entrapment is still unclear, it is likely a result of both steam expanding inside each dough layer and steam migrating to oil layers, where it inflates gas bubbles. The steam migration to oil phase is likely due to the smaller pressure differential required to inflate a bubble of steam in liquid fat than in solid dough.<ref name=":0" /> As the concentration of steam increases between dough layers, the increased pressure causes the dough to lift. During the entire baking process, only half of the water vapor contributes to dough lift, as the other half is lost through micropores and capillaries of interconnected dough layers.

===Storage===
The effect of [[gluten]] proteins during cooling and storage is still unclear. It is possible that gluten proteins influence croissant firming through the loss of plasticizing water, which increases the stiffness of the gluten network.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bosmans|first1=Geertrui M.|last2=Lagrain|first2=Bert|last3=Ooms|first3=Nand|last4=Fierens|first4=Ellen|last5=Delcour|first5=Jan A.|date=2013-05-15|title=Biopolymer Interactions, Water Dynamics, and Bread Crumb Firming|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|volume=61|issue=19|pages=4646–4654|doi=10.1021/jf4010466|pmid=23631677|bibcode=2013JAFC...61.4646B |issn=0021-8561|url=https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/422718|access-date=5 February 2019|archive-date=25 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725014504/https://limo.libis.be/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=LIRIAS100198&context=L&vid=Lirias&search_scope=Lirias&tab=default_tab&lang=en_US&fromSitemap=1|url-status=live|url-access=subscription}}</ref>

Starch plays a major role in the degradation of croissants during storage. [[Amylopectin]] retrogradation occurs over several days to weeks, as amorphous amylopectin chains are realigned into a more [[crystalline]] structure.<ref name=":0" /> The transformation of the starch causes undesirable firmness in the croissant. Additionally, the formation of the crystal structure of amylopectin requires the incorporation of water. [[Retrogradation (starch)|Starch retrogradation]] actively draws water from the amorphous gluten network and some of the amorphous starch fraction, which reduces the plasticity of both.<ref name=":0" />

Water migration influences the quality of stored croissants through two mechanisms. First, as previously stated, water redistributes from [[gluten]] to [[starch]] as a result of [[Retrogradation (starch)|starch retrogradation]]. Secondly, during the baking process, a moisture gradient was introduced as a result of heat transfer from the oven to the croissant.<ref name=":0" /> In fresh croissants, there is high moisture content on the inside and low moisture content on the outside. During storage, this moisture gradient induces water migration from the inside to the outer crust. On a molecular level, water is lost from the amorphous [[starch]] fraction and [[gluten]] network. At the same time, water diffuses from the outer crust to the environment, which has less moisture.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Gray|first1=J.A.|last2=Bemiller |first2=J.N.|date=2003|title=Bread Staling: Molecular Basis and Control |journal=Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1–21|doi=10.1111/j.1541-4337.2003.tb00011.x |pmid=33451240|issn=1541-4337|doi-access=}}</ref> The result of this redistribution of water is a firming up of the croissant, caused by a decrease in starch plasticity and an increase in gluten network rigidity. Due to the presence of large pores in croissants, moisture is lost to the environment at a faster rate than bread products.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last1=Roca|first1=Elisabeth|last2=Guillard |first2=Valérie|last3=Guilbert|first3=Stéphane|last4=Gontard|first4=Nathalie|date=2006-03-01|title=Moisture migration in a cereal composite food at high water activity: Effects of initial porosity and fat content |journal=Journal of Cereal Science|volume=43|issue=2|pages=144–151|doi=10.1016/j.jcs.2005.08.008}}</ref> As such, croissants generally become harder in texture at a faster rate than breads.

Fat also affects the quality of croissants in storage. On one hand, an increased amount of in-dough fat has been found to correspond to a reduction in crumb hardness immediately after baking.<ref name=":0" /> This is likely attributed to the high-fat content of croissants, as increased fat levels decrease moisture diffusion.<ref name=":2" /> On the other hand, although roll-in fat softens the croissant’s initial crumb, its effect on croissant hardness during storage is still unclear.
