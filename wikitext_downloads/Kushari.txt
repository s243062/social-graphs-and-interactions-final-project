==History==
In the Egyptian Books of Genesis,<ref name="Genesis">{{Cite book|last=Alfy|first=Aly|title=الجبتانا أسفار التكوين المصرية - 'The Egyptian Book of Genesis'|page=161}}</ref> the Ancient Egyptian term "Koshir" meant "Food of the rites of the Gods",<ref name="Genesis"/> the Koshir was a breakfast dish that consisted of lentils, wheat, chickpeas, garlic and onions cooked together in clay pots.<ref name=Genesis/> It has been claimed that the original account of the book goes back to [[Manetho]]. However, in the collected works of Manetho, no mention of Koshir could be found.<ref>{{Cite web |title=LacusCurtius • Manetho: History of Egypt (and other Fragments) |url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Manetho/home.html |access-date=2023-12-27 |website=penelope.uchicago.edu}}</ref> The word is not related to the Jewish dietary laws known as [[Kosher]].{{citation needed|date=September 2024}} A priest from [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] described it as a food to eat after fasting on the 11th day of [[Pashons|Pachons]], a month in the ancient Egyptian calendar. Koshary is known as "''The food of the Poor''";<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.aljazeera.net/videos/2014/6/13/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%B7%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1|title=الكشري طعام الفقراء|website=aljazeera.net}}</ref> it consists of fried onions, lentils, rice, macaroni and a red sauce. It is somewhat related to [[Mediterranean cuisine]], but the [[Egyptian cuisine|Egyptian dish]] has different ingredients and flavors, especially the local Egyptian lemon sauce, which gives it the unique taste for which the dish is popular.<ref name="Parvi"/>

In 1853, in his book "Journey to Egypt and the Hijaz", explorer [[Richard Francis Burton|Richard Burton]] documented koshary as the breakfast meal of the people of [[Suez]]. It consisted of Egyptian lentils, rice, butter, onions and pickled lemons.<ref name="RichardBurton">{{cite book|last=Burton|first=Richard|date=1853|title=رحلة بيرتون إلى الحجاز ومصر|url=https://archive.org/details/20201107_20201107_1119/%D8%B1%D8%AD%D9%84%D8%A9%20%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%86%20%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%89%20%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1%20%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%B2/page/n152/mode/1up|page=150|quote=وإذا ما أشرقت الشمس تناول أهل السويس افطارهم الذي يتكون في فصل الصيف من فطيرة, أما في الشتاء فوجبة الإفطار أكثر أهمية وهي طبق من الكشري, عدس وأرز وسمن وبصل مقطع مسوى على نار هادئة أو ليمون مخلل.}}</ref>

Koshary was sold on [[food cart]]s in its early years, and was introduced to restaurants later.<ref name="Parvi">{{cite news |last1=Parvi |first1=Shahrokh |title=Cheap, healthy and oh so tasty: the best kushari in Cairo |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/mar/06/kushari-cairo-rice-lentils-pasta-spicy-cheap |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=6 March 2016 |access-date=8 October 2017 |archive-date=6 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106072541/https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/mar/06/kushari-cairo-rice-lentils-pasta-spicy-cheap |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Variants ==
[[Alexandria]]n koshary is quite different from other koshary recipes, with significant variations in taste and form. The cooking process includes yellow lentils and rice; it also uses [[curry]] and [[cumin]] in the rice, giving the koshary a uniform color. Also included are Egyptian fried eggs, which are boiled and then fried in butter, as well as lightly pickled tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, and [[French fries]] on the side.<ref>{{Cite web|title=كشري اسكندراني بالصور من Alaa Abbas|url=https://cookpad.com/om/%D9%88%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%AA/9553403-%D9%83%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%83%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A|access-date=2020-07-26|website=كوكباد|language=ar|archive-date=2020-07-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200726140555/https://cookpad.com/om/%D9%88%D8%B5%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%AA/9553403-%D9%83%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%83%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2013 |title=Koshari Ads Asfar |url=https://www.hazteveg.com/receta/2467/Koshari-Ads-Asfar |access-date=2024-04-01 |website=HazteVeg.com}}</ref>

Koshary has also gained popularity outside of Egypt in recent years, especially in [[Eastern Arabian cuisine|Eastern Arabia]] and [[Yemen]]. There are variations in each country or region, such as adding grilled vegetables and using [[basmati rice]] cooked either white or yellow. Other recipes of these regions include using other shapes of macaroni. The recipes could include chicken as well, making them closer to [[kabsa]] in some cases.<ref>{{Cite web|title=كشري خليجي بالخضار والدجاج بالصور|url=https://forums.graaam.com/470388.html|access-date=2020-07-26|website=forums.graaam.com|archive-date=2020-07-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200726140811/https://forums.graaam.com/470388.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In [[Japan]], restaurants that serve Koshary have begun to appear, some offering the dish with additions to the original recipe.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Samir |first=Salwa |date=2024-06-03 |title=How a Japanese Chef Introduced Egypt’s Beloved Koshari to Tokyo {{!}} Egyptian Streets |url=https://egyptianstreets.com/2024/06/03/how-a-japanese-chef-introduced-egypts-beloved-koshari-to-tokyo/ |access-date=2025-02-24 |language=en-US}}</ref> Nontraditional ingredients, which are not typically found in Egyptian recipes, are basil chicken, raw tomatoes, [[sour cream]], [[fried egg]]s, [[Cheddar sauce]], avocado slices, and spicy powder with [[jalapeño]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=エジプトめしコシャリ屋さん|url=http://koshary-yasan.hungry.jp/|access-date=2020-07-26|website=koshary-yasan.hungry.jp|archive-date=2020-07-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200726143250/http://koshary-yasan.hungry.jp/|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Dry instant ===
An instant koshary, akin to [[Cup noodle|instant noodles]] in packaging and preparation, started appearing in Egypt in 2020. It requires hot water and 5 to 10 minutes to be ready to eat.<ref>{{Cite web|title=الكشري أصبح مجفف في عبوة سريعة التحضير: "أخيرا هناكله المصيف"|url=https://alwan.elwatannews.com/news/details/4830932/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%A3%D8%B5%D8%A8%D8%AD-%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%81%D9%81-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%A9-%D8%B3%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%B6%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%A3%D8%AE%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7-%D9%87%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%83%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B5%D9%8A%D9%81|access-date=2024-05-20|website=alwan.elwatannews.com}}</ref>
