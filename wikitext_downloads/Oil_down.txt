'''Oil down''' is a salted meat and vegetable stew that is the national dish of [[Grenada]].<ref>[[Ken Albala]], ''[http://www.abc-clio.com/ABC-CLIOCorporate/product.aspx?pc=B3629C Food Cultures of the World]'' Encyclopedia: Four Volumes, [[ABC-CLIO]], 1400 pages, 2011. {{ISBN|978-0-313-37626-9}}</ref>

==Description==
Oil down is a [[stew]] of [[breadfruit]], salted meat, [[chicken (food)|chicken]], [[dumplings]], [[callaloo]], and other vegetables stewed in [[coconut milk]], [[herbs]], and [[spices]].<ref>Jeanne Jacob, Michael Ashkenazi.

The term "oil down" is also used for a traditional neighborhood party at which the stew is prepared and eaten. Traditionally, it is the men who cook the oil down at such parties.<ref name="TravelBlog" /> Oil down is also very popular in local restaurants.<ref name="Gov" />

There is no set [[recipe]] for oil down, as each household and each parish make it to suit their preference.<ref name="stabroeknews" />

{{blockquote | text=Unlike most stews, in which the ingredients get a thorough mixing during the cooking process, a pot of oil down is "packed." Exactly how to "pack the pot" is a matter of taste and tradition, as well as a subject of occasional controversy. Everyone has a different order and method, but usually the breadfruit and meat goes on the bottom, most of the vegetables in the middle, and the callaloo leaves and dumplings on top. The ingredients simmer in situ.<ref name="NPR">{{cite web |title=This Hearty Stew Is A One-Pot Lesson In Grenada's History |author=Scott Neuman |date=11 Sep 2016 |accessdate=17 Apr 2019 |language=en |website=The Salt from NPR |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/09/11/493157111/this-hearty-stew-is-a-one-pot-lesson-in-grenadas-history}}</ref>|author=Scott Neuman, N.P.R.

{{blockquote | text=Traditionally, the dish is finished when all the liquid has been absorbed, which usually takes at least an hour, depending on the size of (the) pot.<ref name="MeatLovesSalt">{{cite web |title=Oil Down: Grenada's National Dish |author=Becca | date=28 Feb 2014 |accessdate=17 Apr 2019 |language=en |website=Meat Loves Salt |url=http://www.meatlovessalt.com/2014/02/grenadas-national-dish-oil-down/}}</ref></p>|author="Meat Loves Salt" blog}}

Oil down is not unique to Grenada. It is also popular in nearby [[Trinidad and Tobago]], which share a long history of cultural influences with Grenada. There are differences in how each island makes its oil down, however, with Grenadians preferring [[dasheen]], [[dumplings]], and [[turmeric]], while Trinidadians tend toward a simpler dish without dumplings but with hot peppers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Who does it best?
