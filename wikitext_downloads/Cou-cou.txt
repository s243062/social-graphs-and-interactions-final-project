'''Cou-cou''', '''coo-coo''' (as it is known in the [[Windward Islands]]), or '''fungee''' (as it is known in the [[Leeward Islands]] and [[Dominica]]), makes up part of the [[national dish]]es of [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Barbados]], [[British Virgin Islands]] and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]]. It consists mainly of [[cornmeal]] (corn flour) and [[okra]] (ochroes).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://barbados.org/barbados-recipes-cou-cou.htm#.XYjejihKi00|title = Barbados Recipes: Cou Cou}}</ref> Cornmeal, which comes readily packaged and is available at [[supermarkets]] islandwide, and okra, which can be found at supermarkets, vegetable markets and home gardens, are very inexpensive ingredients. Because these main components are inexpensive, the dish became common for many residents in Barbados' early colonial history. In Angola, a similar meal is made with yellow or white cornmeal and called 'funge' and in Ghana, a similar meal of fermented corn or maize flour eaten with okra stew and fish is known as ''banku'', a favourite dish of the Ga tribe in Accra.

A cooking utensil called a 'cou-cou stick', or 'fungee stick', is a type of [[spurtle]] used in its preparation. A cou-cou stick is made of [[wood]], and has a long, flat rectangular shape like a {{convert|1|ft|cm|adj=mid|-long}} miniature [[cricket bat]]. It is believed by Barbadians to be essential in stirring the cou-cou, as the dish takes on a firm texture and the cou-cou stick makes it easier to stir in a large pot.

[[Flying fish]] prepared fried or steamed is a usual complement to cou-cou. Cou-cou and flying fish has become Barbados' national dish.  Traditionally, cou-cou is served on Fridays at homes across Barbados and local food establishments. Cou-cou can also be prepared using [[breadfruit]] instead of cornmeal.

In [[Trinidad and Tobago]], cou-cou (or coo-coo) is often prepared alongside [[callaloo]] and either stewed or fried fish.
