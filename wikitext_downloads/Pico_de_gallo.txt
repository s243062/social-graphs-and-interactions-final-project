'''''Pico de gallo''''' ({{IPA|es|ˈpiko ðe ˈɣaʝo|lang}}; {{literally|rooster's beak}}), also called '''''salsa fresca''''' ('fresh sauce'), '''''salsa bandera''''' ('flag sauce'), and '''''salsa cruda''''' ('raw sauce'), is a type of [[salsa (sauce)|salsa]] commonly used in [[Mexican cuisine]]. It is traditionally made from chopped [[tomato]], [[onion]], and [[serrano pepper]]s ([[jalapeño]]s or [[habanero]]s may be used as alternatives), with salt, lime juice, and [[cilantro]].

''Pico de gallo'' can be used in much the same way as Mexican liquid salsas. Because it contains less liquid, it also can be used as a main ingredient in dishes such as [[taco]]s and [[fajita]]s.

The tomato-based variety is widely known as '''''salsa picada''''' ('[[Mincing|minced]]/chopped [[sauce]]'). In Mexico it is normally called '''''salsa mexicana''''' ('Mexican sauce'). Because the colors of the red tomato, white onion, and green chili and cilantro are reminiscent of the colors of the [[Flag of Mexico|Mexican flag]], it is also called '''''salsa bandera''''' ('flag sauce').

In many regions of Mexico the term ''pico de gallo'' describes any of a variety of [[salad]]s (including [[fruit salad]]s), [[Salsa (sauce)|salsa]], or [[Filling (cooking)|filling]]s made with [[tomato]], [[tomatillo]], [[avocado]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], [[jícama]], cucumber, [[papaya]], or mild chilis. The ingredients are tossed in lime juice and optionally with either [[hot sauce]] or [[Chamoy (sauce)|chamoy]], then sprinkled with a salty [[chili powder]].

==Etymology==
Many native residents of the [[Sonora, Mexico|Sonoran Mexico]] region explain that the salsa is thus named because the [[serrano pepper]] resembles a rooster's beak in shape.<ref>Wilder, Janos. ''The Great Chiles Rellenos Book''. Ten Speed Press, 2013.</ref> According to [[food writer]] [[Sharon Tyler Herbst]],<ref>[[Sharon Tyler Herbst]], ''[[Food Lover's Companion]]'', 2nd ed., as quoted in Barron's Educational Services, Inc. 1995: www.Epicurious.com, retrieved 10/3/2007. [http://www.epicurious.com/tools/fooddictionary/search?query=pico+de+gallo pico de gallo].</ref> ''pico de gallo'' ('rooster's beak') is named thus because originally people ate it by pinching pieces between the [[thumb]] and [[forefinger]]. In their book ''Authentic Mexican: Regional Cooking from the Heart of Mexico'', [[Rick Bayless]] and [[Deann Groen]] speculate that the name might allude to the [[bird feed|bird-feed]]—like texture and appearance of the mince.<ref>Bayless, Rick; Groen, Deann.
