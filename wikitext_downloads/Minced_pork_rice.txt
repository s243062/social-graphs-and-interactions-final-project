'''''Ló͘-bah-pn̄g''''' ([[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]]: ló͘-bah-pn̄g), also called '''''bah-sò-pn̄g''''' in southern Taiwan, or translated to '''minced pork rice''' in English, is a rice dish that is commonly seen throughout [[Taiwan]] and [[Minnan region|Southern Fujian, China]].<ref>Phillips, Carolyn. All Under Heaven: Recipes from the 35 Cuisines of China. Page 208. Ten Speed Press. Kindle Edition.</ref> The flavor may vary from one region to another, but the basic ingredients remain the same: ground pork marinated and boiled in soy sauce served on top of steamed rice. It is a type of [[gaifan]] dish.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Fragpork Rice from Formosa Chang Taipei Neihu Store.jpg|thumb|Minced pork rice served with pickles]]
滷肉飯 has the direct meaning of "rice with braised meat." However, for several decades, many Taiwanese people have used the [[homophone]] "魯" instead of "滷". Although people still use the original character in China, "魯肉飯" has become the most common name seen in Taiwanese restaurants and street vendors. 魯 is the ancient name for the Chinese province of [[Shandong]], which led the Taiwan edition of the [[Michelin Guide#Green Guides|Michelin Green Guide]] to write in April 2011 that minced pork rice originated in Shandong. In response, the [[Taipei City Government]] held a press conference requesting a revision to the Michelin guidebook to specify that it was a Taiwanese dish.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2011/08/30/2003512028 |title=Taipei serves up free 'luroufan' to set record straight |page=2 |work=Taipei Times |agency=with CNA |date=Aug 30, 2011 |access-date=3 December 2015 |archive-date=8 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208063801/http://taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2011/08/30/2003512028 |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Preparation ==
As the origin of the flavor, the sauce is the key to making minced pork rice. The most popular way of preparation seen in Taiwan is stir-frying the [[ground meat]] with sliced [[shallot]] in oil, and then boiling it in soy sauce. In the frying process, one may customize the flavor by adding seasonings such as [[sugar]], [[rice wine]], [[Black pepper|pepper]] and other spices. {{cn|date=October 2022}}
When finished, the dark-brown meat sauce is called "bah-sò (肉燥)", and is also served with noodles, soup, vegetables and many homemade Taiwanese dishes. <ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141129072915/http://www.justafoodblog.com/taiwanese-braised-pork-rice/ The dish is commonly served with stir-fried vegetables and a marinated hard boiled egg on the side].</ref>

== Regional varieties ==
While minced pork rice is an important icon in typical Taiwanese [[folk cuisine]], the variety of methods to customize flavors is so wide that it creates considerable differences between regions. In southern Taiwan, where people name it by the sauce "bah-sò-pn̄g (肉燥飯)" instead of the meat, minced pork rice is preferably served with pork with less fat. People in the north of Taiwan favor a greasier version of meat sauce with rice, sometimes even with [[glutinous rice]] mixed in.{{cn|date=October 2022}}

In southern Taiwan, while "bah-sò-pn̄g" is seen on the menu indicating minced pork rice, "ló͘-bah-pn̄g (滷肉飯)" remains on the very same menu, referring to another dish where [[Braised pork rice|braised pork belly covers the rice]]. The same rice with braised pork belly is known as "khòng-bah-pn̄g (焢肉飯)" in northern Taiwan.<ref name=newslens/>
