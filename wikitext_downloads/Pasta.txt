'''Pasta''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|p|æ|s|t|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|US||ˈ|p|ɑː|s|t|ə}}; {{IPA|it|ˈpasta|lang}}) is a type of food typically made from an [[Leavening agent|unleavened dough]] of [[wheat]] flour mixed with water or [[Eggs as food|eggs]], and formed into sheets or other shapes, then cooked by [[boiling]] or [[baking]]. Pasta was originally only made with [[durum]], although the definition has been expanded to include alternatives for a [[gluten-free diet]], such as [[rice flour]], or [[legume]]s such as beans or [[lentil]]s. Pasta is believed to have developed independently in [[Italy in the Middle Ages|Italy]] and is a [[staple food]] of [[Italian cuisine]],<ref name="padalino">{{cite journal |vauthors=Padalino L, Conte A, Del Nobile MA |year=2016 |title=Overview on the General Approaches to Improve Gluten-Free Pasta and Bread |journal=Foods |type=Review |volume=5 |issue=4 |page=87 |doi=10.3390/foods5040087 |pmc=5302439 |pmid=28231182 |doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name="LalegCassan20162">{{cite journal|vauthors=Laleg K, Cassan D, Barron C, Prabhasankar P, Micard V|year=2016|title=Structural, Culinary, Nutritional and Anti-Nutritional Properties of High Protein, Gluten Free, 100% Legume Pasta. |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=11 |issue=9 |article-number=e0160721 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0160721 |pmc=5014310 |pmid=27603917 |bibcode=2016PLoSO..1160721L |doi-access=free}}</ref> with evidence of [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] making pasta as early as 400 BCE in Italy.<ref name="Hatchett-2008">{{Cite web |last=Hatchett |first=Toby |date=2008-02-26 |title=The saucy history of pasta |url=https://www.seacoastonline.com/story/news/local/portsmouth-herald/2008/02/27/the-saucy-history-pasta/52595972007/ |access-date=2024-04-02 |website=Portsmouth Herald |language=en-US |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20251116060809/https://www.seacoastonline.com/story/news/local/portsmouth-herald/2008/02/27/the-saucy-history-pasta/52595972007/|archive-date=November 16, 2025}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Eredi |first=Veronica |date=2023-04-27 |title=The history of PASTA, from the Etruscans to Dez AMORE |url=https://dezamore.co.uk/the-history-of-pasta-from-the-etruscans-to-dez-amore/ |access-date=2024-04-02 |website=Dez Amore |language=en-US}}</ref><!-- Production -->

Pastas are divided into two broad categories: dried ({{langx|it|pasta secca}}) and fresh (Italian: {{lang|it|pasta fresca}}). Most dried pasta is produced commercially via an [[Food extrusion|extrusion]] process, although it can be produced at home. Fresh pasta is traditionally produced by hand, sometimes with the aid of simple machines.<ref name="Marcella">Hazan, Marcella (1992). ''Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking''. Knopf. {{ISBN|0-394-58404-X}}.</ref> Fresh pastas available in grocery stores are produced commercially by large-scale machines.

<!-- Varieties -->Both dried and fresh pastas come in a number of shapes and varieties, with 310 specific forms known by over 1,300 documented names.<ref name="Zanini">Zanini De Vita, Oretta. ''Encyclopedia of Pasta''. [[University of California Press]]. {{ISBN|9780520255227}}.</ref> In Italy, the names of specific pasta shapes or types often vary by locale. For example, the pasta form {{lang|it|[[cavatelli]]}} is known by 28 different names depending upon the town and region. Common forms of pasta include long and short shapes, tubes, flat shapes or sheets, miniature shapes for [[soup]], those meant to be filled or stuffed, and specialty or decorative shapes.<ref>Hazan, Giuliano (1993). ''The Classic Pasta Cookbook''. Dorling Kindersley. {{ISBN|1564582922}}.</ref>

<!-- Classification of dishes in Italian cuisine --><!-- Overview of pasta dishes -->As a category in Italian cuisine, both fresh and dried pastas are classically used in one of three kinds of prepared dishes: as {{lang|it|pasta asciutta}} (or {{lang|it|pastasciutta}}), cooked pasta is plated and served with a complementary sauce or condiment; a second classification of pasta dishes is {{lang|it|pasta in brodo}}, in which the pasta is part of a soup-type dish. A third category is {{lang|it|[[pasta al forno]]}}, in which the pasta is incorporated into a dish that is subsequently baked in the oven.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dinneratthezoo.com/pasta-al-forno/ | title=Pasta al Forno | work=Dinner at the Zoo| date=15 April 2020 }}</ref> Pasta dishes are generally simple, but individual dishes vary in preparation. Some pasta dishes are served as a small first course or for light lunches, such as [[pasta salad]]s. Other dishes may be portioned larger and used for dinner. Pasta sauces similarly may vary in taste, color and texture.<ref>{{cite book|title=Pasta|publisher=Parragon Publishing|location=UK|pages=6–57|isbn=978-1-4054-2516-2|year=2005}}</ref>

<!-- Nutrition -->In terms of [[human nutrition|nutrition]], cooked plain pasta is 31% [[carbohydrate]]s (mostly [[starch]]), 6% protein and is low in fat, with moderate amounts of [[manganese]], but pasta generally has low [[micronutrient]] content. Pasta may be [[Food fortification|enriched or fortified]], or made from [[whole grain]]s.

==History==
[[File:6-alimenti, pasta,Taccuino Sanitatis, Casanatense 4182..jpg|thumb|Making pasta; illustration from the 15th-century edition of {{lang|la|[[Tacuinum Sanitatis]]}}, a Latin translation of the [[Arabic]] work {{transliteration|ar|Taqwīm al-sihha}} by [[Ibn Butlan]]<ref name=Watson>Watson, Andrew M (1983). ''Agricultural innovation in the early Islamic world''. New York: [[Cambridge University Press]]. p. 22–23</ref>]]
Evidence of [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] making pasta dates back to 400 BCE.<ref name="Hatchett-2008" /> The first concrete information on pasta products in [[Italy in the Middle Ages|Italy]] dates to the 13th or 14th centuries.{{sfn|Serventi|Sabban|2002|page=10}} In the 1st-century{{dubious|date=September 2023}} writings of [[Horace]], {{lang|la|[[lagana (dough)|lagana]]}} ({{singular}}: {{lang|la|laganum}}) were fine sheets of fried dough{{sfn|Serventi|Sabban|2002|page=24}} and were an everyday foodstuff.{{sfn|Serventi|Sabban|2002|pages=15–16}} Writing in the 2nd century, [[Athenaeus|Athenaeus of Naucratis]] provides a recipe for {{lang|la|lagana}} which he attributes to the 1st-century Chrysippus of Tyana: sheets of dough made of wheat flour and the juice of crushed lettuce, then flavored with spices and deep-fried in oil.{{sfn|Serventi|Sabban|2002|pages=15–16}} An early 5th-century cookbook describes a dish called {{lang|la|lagana}} that consisted of layers of dough with meat stuffing, an ancestor of modern-day [[lasagna]].{{sfn|Serventi|Sabban|2002|pages=15–16}} However, the method of cooking these sheets of dough does not correspond to the modern definition of either a fresh or dry pasta product, which only had similar basic ingredients and perhaps the shape.{{sfn|Serventi|Sabban|2002|pages=15–16}}

Historians have noted several lexical milestones relevant to pasta, none of which changes these basic characteristics. For example, the works of the 2nd-century Greek physician [[Galen]] mention {{transliteration|grc|itrion}}, homogeneous compounds made of flour and water.{{sfn|Serventi|Sabban|2002|page=17}} The [[Jerusalem Talmud]] records that {{transliteration|grc|itrium}}, a kind of boiled dough,{{sfn|Serventi|Sabban|2002|page=17}} was common in [[Syria Palaestina|Palestine]] from the 3rd to 5th centuries.{{sfn|Serventi|Sabban|2002|page=29}} A dictionary compiled by the 9th-century Arab physician and lexicographer [[Isho bar Ali]]<ref>"A medical text in Arabic written by a Jewish doctor living in Tunisia in the early 900s", according to {{cite book|ref=Dickie|author=Dickie, John |year=2008|title=Delizia! The Epic History of Italians and Their Food|publisher=Simon and Schuster|place= New York|pages=21 ff|isbn=978-1-4165-5400-4}}</ref> defines {{transliteration|ar|itriyya}}, the Arabic cognate, as string-like shapes made of [[semolina]] and dried before cooking. 

The geographical text of [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]], compiled for the [[Norman king of Sicily]] [[Roger II of Sicily|Roger II]] in 1154, mentions {{transliteration|ar|itriyya}} manufactured and exported from [[Norman Sicily]]:

{{blockquote|West of Termini there is a delightful settlement called Trabia [along the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] coast east of [[Palermo]]]. Its ever-flowing streams propel a number of mills. Here there are huge buildings in the countryside where they make vast quantities of {{transliteration|ar|itriyya}} which is exported everywhere: to [[Calabria]], to Muslim and Christian countries. Very many shiploads are sent.<ref>Quoted in [[#Dickie|Dickie]], p. 21.</ref>}}

One form of {{transliteration|ar|itriyya}} with a long history is {{lang|la|lagana}}, which in Latin refers to thin sheets of dough,{{sfn|Serventi|Sabban|2002|pages=15–16}} and gave rise to the Italian {{lang|it|lasagna}}.

Food historians estimate that the dish probably took hold in Italy as a result of extensive Mediterranean trading in the Middle Ages. From the 13th century, references to pasta dishes crop up with increasing frequency across the Italian peninsula.<ref name="nationalgeographic">{{cite magazine |last1=López |first1=Alfonso |title=The Twisted History of Pasta |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/magazine/2016/07-08/daily-life-pasta-italy-neapolitan-diet/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191214163410/https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/magazine/2016/07-08/daily-life-pasta-italy-neapolitan-diet/ |archive-date=14 December 2019 |access-date=18 December 2019 |magazine=National Geographic |date=8 July 2016}}</ref> In the 14th-century writer Boccaccio's collection of earthy tales, ''[[The Decameron]]'', he recounts a mouthwatering fantasy concerning a mountain of [[Parmesan|Parmesan cheese]] down which pasta chefs roll macaroni and ravioli to gluttons waiting below.<ref name="nationalgeographic"/>

===In modern times===
The art of pasta making and the devotion to the food as a whole has evolved since pasta was first conceptualized. In 2008, it was estimated that Italians ate over {{cvt|60|lb|kg|order=flip}} of pasta per person, per year, easily beating Americans, who ate about {{cvt|20|lb|kg|0|order=flip}} per person.<ref name="Demetri"/> Pasta is so beloved in Italy that individual consumption exceeds the average production of wheat of the country; thus, Italy frequently imports wheat for pasta making. In contemporary society, pasta is ubiquitous and there is a variety of types in local supermarkets, in many countries. With the worldwide demand for this staple food, pasta is now largely mass-produced in factories and only a tiny proportion is crafted by hand.<ref name="Demetri"/>

==Ingredients and preparation==
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 11385 Pasta made from durum wheat.jpg|thumb|Pasta made from [[durum wheat]]]]
Since at least the time of [[Cato the Elder|Cato]]'s {{lang|la|[[De Agri Cultura]]}}, basic pasta dough has been made mostly of wheat flour or [[semolina]],<ref name="Zanini" /> with [[durum wheat]] used predominantly in the [[Southern Italy|south]] and [[Common wheat|soft wheat]] in the [[Northern Italy|north]] of Italy. Regionally other grains have been used, including those from barley, buckwheat, rye, rice and maize, as well as chestnut and chickpea flours. Liquid, often in the form of eggs, is used to turn the flour into a dough.

To address the needs of people affected by [[gluten-related disorders]] (such as [[coeliac disease]], [[non-celiac gluten sensitivity]] and [[wheat allergy]] sufferers),<ref name="VriezingaSchweizer2015">{{cite journal|vauthors=Vriezinga SL, Schweizer JJ, Koning F, Mearin ML| title=Coeliac disease and gluten-related disorders in childhood|journal=Nat Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol|volume=12|issue=9|pages=527–36|date=Sep 2015|pmid=26100369|doi=10.1038/nrgastro.2015.98| s2cid=2023530|type=Review|quote=Gluten-related disorders such as coeliac disease, wheat allergy and noncoeliac gluten sensitivity are increasingly being diagnosed in children.{{nbsp}}[...] These three gluten-related disorders are treated with a [[gluten-free diet]].}}</ref> some recipes use rice or [[maize]] for making pasta.

Other additions to the basic flour-liquid mixture may include vegetable purees such as spinach or tomato, mushrooms, cheeses, herbs, spices and other seasonings. While pastas are, most typically, made from unleavened doughs, at least nine different pasta forms are known to use yeast-raised doughs.<ref name="Zanini" />

Additives in dried, commercially sold pasta include vitamins and minerals that are lost from the durum wheat endosperm during milling. They are added back to the semolina flour once it is ground, creating [[enriched flour]]. [[Micronutrient]]s added may include [[Vitamin B3|niacin]] (vitamin B3), [[riboflavin]] (vitamin B2), [[folate]], [[thiamine]] (vitamin B1) and [[Ferrous|ferrous iron]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Man|last2=Zhu|first2=Ke-Xue|last3=Guo|first3=Xiao-Na|last4=Brijs|first4=Kristof|last5=Zhou|first5=Hui-Ming|date=1 July 2014|title=Natural Additives in Wheat-Based Pasta and Noodle Products: Opportunities for Enhanced Nutritional and Functional Properties|journal=Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety|language=en|volume=13|issue=4|pages=347–357|doi=10.1111/1541-4337.12066|pmid=33412715|issn=1541-4337|doi-access=}}</ref>

===Fresh===
Fresh pasta is usually locally made with fresh ingredients unless it is destined to be shipped, in which case consideration is given to the spoilage rates of the desired ingredients such as eggs or herbs. Furthermore, fresh pasta is usually made with a mixture of eggs and all-purpose flour or "00" low-gluten flour. Since it contains eggs, it is more tender compared to dried pasta and only takes about half the time to cook.<ref name="Quessenberry">{{cite web|last=Quessenberry|first=Sara|title=Dried Vs. Fresh Pasta|url=http://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/shopping-storing/food/dried-vs-fresh-pasta-10000001609408/|publisher=Real Simple|access-date=28 March 2012}}</ref> Delicate sauces are preferred for fresh pasta in order to let the pasta take front stage.<ref name="Christensen">{{cite web|last=Christensen|first=Emma|title=Dry Pasta vs. Fresh Pasta: What's the Difference?|work=Kitchn |url=http://www.thekitchn.com/dry-pasta-vs-fresh-pasta-whats-47888|publisher=The Kitchn|access-date=28 March 2012}}</ref>

Fresh pastas do not expand in size after cooking; therefore, {{cvt|1.5|lb|kg|1|order=flip}} of pasta are needed to serve four people generously.<ref name="Quessenberry" /> Fresh egg pasta is generally cut into strands of various widths and thicknesses depending on which pasta is to be made (e.g., fettuccine, pappardelle and lasagne). It is best served with meat, cheese or vegetables to create [[filled pasta]]s such as [[ravioli]], [[tortellini]] and [[cannelloni]]. Fresh egg pasta is well known in the [[Piedmont]] and [[Emilia-Romagna]] regions of northern Italy. In this area, dough is only made out of egg yolk and flour resulting in a very refined flavor and texture. This pasta is often served simply with butter sauce and thinly sliced truffles that are native to this region. In other areas, such as [[Apulia]], fresh pasta can be made without eggs. The only ingredients needed to make the pasta dough are semolina flour and water, which is often shaped into [[orecchiette]] or {{lang|it|[[cavatelli]]}}. Fresh pasta for {{lang|it|cavatelli}} is also popular in other places including [[Sicily]]. However, the dough is prepared differently: it is made of flour and [[Ricotta|ricotta cheese]] instead.<ref name="Laux">{{cite web|last=Laux|first=Sandra|title=Types of Pasta|url=http://www.mangiabenepasta.com/types.html|publisher=Mangia Bene Pasta|access-date=28 March 2012|archive-date=17 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617053709/http://www.mangiabenepasta.com/types.html|url-status=usurped}}</ref>

===Dried===
Dried pasta can also be defined as factory-made pasta because it is usually produced in large amounts that require large machines with superior processing capabilities to manufacture.<ref name="Laux" /> Dried pasta can be shipped farther and has a longer shelf life. The ingredients required to make dried pasta include semolina flour and water. Eggs can be added for flavor and richness, but are not needed to make dried pasta. In contrast to fresh pasta, dried pasta needs to be dried at a low temperature for several days to evaporate all the moisture allowing it to be stored for a longer period. Dried pastas are best served in hearty dishes, such as [[ragù]] sauces, soups and casseroles.<ref name="Christensen" /> Once it is cooked, the dried pasta will usually grow to twice its original size. Therefore, approximately {{cvt|1|lb|kg|1|order=flip}} of dried pasta serves up to four people.<ref name="Quessenberry" />

===Cooking===
Pasta, whether dry or fresh, is eaten after cooking it in hot water. For Italian pasta, which is unsalted, salt is added to the cooking water. This is not the case for Asian wheat noodles, such as [[udon]] and [[lo mein]], which are made from salty dough.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Moskin |first=Julia |date=2024-04-08 |title=Yes, You Can Wash Cast Iron: 5 Big Kitchen Myths, Debunked |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/08/dining/kitchen-myths.html |access-date=2024-04-21 |work=The New York Times |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

In Italy, pasta is often cooked to be [[al dente]], such that it is still firm to the bite. This is because it is then often cooked in the sauce for a short time, which makes it soften further.<ref name="Moskin-2024">{{Cite news |last=Moskin |first=Julia |date=2024-04-20 |title=No, Your Spaghetti Doesn't Have to Be al Dente: 5 Pasta Myths, Debunked |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/20/dining/how-to-cook-pasta-questions.html |access-date=2024-04-21 |work=The New York Times |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

There are a number of [[urban myth]]s about how pasta should be cooked. In fact, it does not generally matter whether pasta is cooked at a lower or a higher temperature, although lower temperatures require more stirring to avoid sticking, and certain stuffed pasta, such as tortellini, break up in higher temperatures.<ref name="Moskin-2024" /> It also does not matter whether salt is added before or after bringing the water to a boil.<ref name="Moskin-2024" /> The amount of salt has no influence on cooking speed.<ref name="Moskin-2024" />

===Sauce===
Pasta is generally served with some type of sauce; the sauce and the type of pasta are usually matched based on consistency and ease of eating. [[Northern Italy|Northern Italian]] cooking uses less tomato sauce, garlic and herbs, and [[béchamel sauce]] is more common.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aspenbusinessjournal.com/article/id/736/sid/16 |work=The Aspen Business Journal |title=Lidia Bastianich on the quintessential Italian meal |date=19 June 2011 |access-date=1 January 2012 |first1=Gail |last1=Montany |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130083057/http://www.aspenbusinessjournal.com/article/id/736/sid/16 |archive-date=30 January 2012 }}</ref> However, Italian cuisine is best identified by individual regions. Pasta dishes with lighter use of tomato are found in [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol|Trentino-Alto Adige]] and [[Emilia-Romagna]] regions of northern Italy.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Bastianich | first1=Lidia | author-link=Lidia Bastianich | first2= Manuali | last2=Tania | title=Lidia Cooks from the Heart of Italy: A Feast of 175 Regional Recipes | edition=1st}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1=Bastianich | first1=Lidia | author-link=Lidia Bastianich | first2= Mariani | last2=John | title=How Italian Food Conquered the World | edition=1st}}</ref> In Bologna, the meat-based [[Bolognese sauce]] incorporates a small amount of tomato concentrate and a green sauce called [[pesto]] originates from [[Genoa]]. In [[central Italy]], there are sauces such as [[tomato sauce]], {{lang|it|[[amatriciana]]}}, {{lang|it|[[arrabbiata]]}} and [[carbonara]].

Tomato sauces are also present in [[Southern Italy|southern Italian]] cuisine, where they originated. In southern Italy more complex variations include pasta paired with fresh vegetables, olives, capers or seafood. Varieties include {{lang|it|[[pasta alla Norma]]}}, {{lang|it|[[pasta con i peperoni cruschi]]}}, {{lang|it|[[pasta con le sarde]]}}, {{lang|it|[[Spaghetti aglio e olio|spaghetti aglio, olio e peperoncino]]}} ({{literally|spaghetti with garlic, [olive] oil and peperoncino}}) and {{lang|it|[[spaghetti alla puttanesca]]}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.the-pasta-project.com/cavatelli-pasta-with-peperoni-cruschi/|title=Cavatelli pasta with peperoni cruschi (Senise peppers)|website=the-pasta-project.com|date=25 September 2017|access-date=18 August 2020}}</ref>

Pasta can be served also in [[broth]] ([[pastina]], or stuffed pasta, such as [[tortellini]], {{lang|it|[[Cappelletti (pasta)|cappelletti]]}} and {{lang|it|[[agnolini]]}}) or in vegetable soup, typically [[minestrone]] or bean soup ({{lang|it|[[pasta e fagioli]]}}).

===Fresh===
[[File:Pasta machine 2.jpg|thumb|A pasta machine in use]]
Ingredients to make pasta dough include semolina flour, egg, salt and water. Flour is first mounded on a flat surface and then a well in the pile of flour is created. Egg is then poured into the well and a fork is used to mix the egg and flour.<ref>{{cite web|title=How to Make Pasta Dough|url=http://allrecipes.com/howto/making-pasta-dough/|publisher=allrecipes|access-date=24 March 2012|archive-date=20 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320092228/http://allrecipes.com/howto/making-pasta-dough}}</ref> There are a variety of ways to shape the sheets of pasta depending on the type required. The most popular types include [[penne]], [[spaghetti]] and [[macaroni]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Fresh Pasta|url=http://allrecipes.com/HowTo/Fresh-Pasta/Detail.aspx|publisher=allrecipes|access-date=24 March 2012|archive-date=21 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321030155/http://allrecipes.com/HowTo/Fresh-Pasta/Detail.aspx}}</ref>

Kitchen pasta [[Machine|machines]], also called pasta makers, are popular with cooks who make large amounts of fresh pasta. The cook feeds sheets of pasta dough into the machine by hand and, by turning a [[Crank (mechanism)|hand crank]], [[Roll forming|rolls]] the pasta to thin it incrementally. On the final pass through the pasta machine, the pasta may be directed through a machine 'comb' to shape of the pasta as it emerges.

===Matrix and extrusion===
Semolina flour consists of a protein matrix with entrapped starch granules. Upon the addition of water, during mixing, intermolecular forces allow the protein to form a more ordered structure in preparation for cooking.<ref name="Sicignano">{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jsfa.7176 |pmid=25783568 |title=From raw material to dish: Pasta quality step by step |journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture |volume=95 |issue=13 |pages=2579–2587 |year=2015 |last1=Sicignano |first1=Angelo |last2=Di Monaco |first2=Rossella |last3=Masi |first3=Paolo |last4=Cavella |first4=Silvana|bibcode=2015JSFA...95.2579S }}</ref>

Durum wheat is ground into semolina flour which is sorted by optical scanners and cleaned.<ref name="wg">{{cite web |url=http://www.world-grain.com/Departments/Milling-Operations/2014/7/The-complexities-of-durum-milling.aspx?cck=1 |title=The complexities of durum milling |website=world-grain.com |publisher=Sosland Publishing Co. |date=2 July 2014 |access-date=15 December 2016 |archive-date=20 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220142422/http://www.world-grain.com/Departments/Milling-Operations/2014/7/The-complexities-of-durum-milling.aspx?cck=1 }}</ref> Pipes allow the flour to move to a mixing machine where it is mixed with warm water by rotating blades. When the mixture is of a lumpy consistency, the mixture is pressed into sheets or [[food extrusion|extruded]]. Varieties of pasta such as spaghetti and linguine are cut by rotating blades, while pasta such as penne and fusilli are extruded. The size and shape of the dies in the extruder through which the pasta is pushed determine the shape that results. The pasta is then dried at a high temperature.<ref name="Sissons-2008">{{Cite journal|last=Sissons|first=M|year=2008|title=Role of durum wheat composition on the quality of pasta and bread|journal=Food|volume=2 | issue = 2 |pages=75–90}}</ref>

===Factory-manufactured===
The ingredients to make dried pasta usually include water and semolina flour; egg for color and richness (in some types of pasta), and possibly vegetable juice (such as spinach, beet, tomato, carrot), herbs or spices for color and flavor. After mixing semolina flour with warm water the dough is kneaded mechanically until it becomes firm and dry. If pasta is to be flavored, eggs, vegetable juices and herbs are added at this stage. The dough is then passed into the laminator to be flattened into sheets, then compressed by a vacuum mixer-machine to clear out air bubbles and excess water from the dough until the moisture content is reduced to 12%. Next, the dough is processed in a steamer to kill any bacteria it may contain.

The dough is then ready to be shaped into different types of pasta. Depending on the type of pasta to be made, the dough can either be cut or extruded through dies. The pasta is set in a drying tank under specific conditions of heat, moisture and time depending on the type of pasta. The dried pasta is then packaged: fresh pasta is sealed in a clear, airtight [[plastic container]] with a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen that inhibits microbial growth and prolongs the product's shelf life; dried pastas are sealed in clear plastic or cardboard packages.<ref>{{cite web|title=How pasta is made|url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-2/Pasta.html#b|publisher=made how|access-date=27 March 2012}}</ref>

===Gluten-free===
[[Gluten]], the protein found in grains such as wheat, rye, spelt and barley, contributes to protein aggregation and firm texture of a normally cooked pasta. Gluten-free pasta is produced with wheat flour substitutes, such as vegetable powders, rice, corn, quinoa, amaranth, oats and buckwheat flours.<ref name="Gao et al 2017">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/ijfs.13505 |title=Gluten-free bakery and pasta products: Prevalence and quality improvement |journal=International Journal of Food Science & Technology |volume=53|issue=1 |pages=19–32 |year=2018 |last1=Gao |first1=Yupeng |last2=Janes |first2=Marlene E |last3=Chaiya |first3=Busarawan |last4=Brennan |first4=Margaret A |last5=Brennan |first5=Charles S |last6=Prinyawiwatkul |first6=Witoon|doi-access=free |hdl=10182/10123 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> Other possible gluten-free pasta ingredients may include [[Colloid#Hydrocolloids|hydrocolloid]]s to improve cooking pasta with high heat resistance, [[xanthan gum]] to retain moisture during storage, or hydrothermally-treated [[polysaccharide]] mixtures to produce textures similar to those of wheat pasta.<ref name="Gao et al 2017"/><ref name="padalino"/>

===Storage===
The storage of pasta depends on its processing and extent of drying.<ref name=Sicignano/> Uncooked pasta is kept dry and can sit in the cupboard for a year if airtight and stored in a cool, dry area. Cooked pasta is stored in the refrigerator for a maximum of five days in an airtight container. Adding a couple teaspoons of oil helps keep the food from sticking to itself and the container. Cooked pasta may be frozen for up to two or three months. Should the pasta be dried completely, it can be placed back in the cupboard.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pasta Handling, Safety & Storage|url=http://www.recipetips.com/kitchen-tips/t--166/pasta-handling-safety-storage.asp|access-date=27 March 2012|author=Recipe Tips}}</ref>

===Impact of processing on physical structure===
[[File:DEMACO 1,000 lbs-hr Short Goods Pasta Press, 1958.jpg|thumb|Early industrial pasta extruder with mixer, extrusion unit, head holding die in place and cutter below the die]]

The desired moisture content of the dough is around 32% wet basis and will vary depending on the shape of pasta being produced.<ref name="Petitot-2009" />

The forming process involves the dough entering an extruder in which the rotation of a single or double screw system pushes the dough toward a die set to a specific shape.<ref name=wg/> As the starch granules swell slightly in the presence of water and a low amount of thermal energy, they become embedded within the protein matrix and align along the direction of the shear caused by the extrusion process.<ref name="Petitot-2009" />

When cooked, plain pasta is composed of 62% water, 31% [[Carbohydrate|carbohydrates]] (26% [[starch]]), 6% [[protein (nutrient)|protein]] and 1% [[fat]]. A {{convert|100|g|oz|frac=2|adj=on}} portion of [[Food fortification|unenriched]] cooked pasta provides {{convert|160|kcal|kJ|order=flip}} of [[food energy]] and a moderate level of [[manganese]] (15% of the [[Reference Daily Intake|Daily Value]]), but few other [[micronutrient]]s.

Pasta has a lower [[glycemic index]] than many other staple foods in Western culture, such as bread, potatoes and rice.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/glycemic-index-and-glycemic-load-for-100-foods|title=Glycemic index for 60+ foods|work=Harvard Health|access-date=11 September 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

==International adaptations==
As pasta was introduced elsewhere in the world, it became incorporated into a number of local cuisines, which often have significantly different ways of preparation from those of Italy. When pasta was introduced to different nations, each culture would adopt a different style of preparation. In the past, [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] cooked pasta-like foods by frying rather than boiling.

Pasta is also widespread in the [[Southern Cone]], as well most of the rest of [[Brazil]], mostly pervasive in the areas with mild to strong Italian roots, such as Central Argentina, and the eight southernmost Brazilian states (where [[macaroni]] is called {{lang|pt|macarrão}}, and more general pasta is known under the umbrella term {{lang|pt|massa}} ({{literally|dough}}), together with some [[Japanese noodles]], such as ''bifum'' [[rice vermicelli]] and ''[[yakisoba]]'', which also entered general taste). The local names for the pasta are many times varieties of the Italian names, such as {{lang|pt|ñoquis/nhoque}} for [[gnocchi]], {{lang|pt|ravioles/ravióli}} for ravioli or {{lang|pt|tallarines/talharim}} for tagliatelle, although some of the most popular pasta in Brazil, such as the {{lang|pt|parafuso}} ('screw', 'bolt'), a specialty of the country's [[pasta salad]]s, are also way different both in name and format from its closest Italian relatives, in this case the [[fusilli]].<ref>{{usurped|1=[https://web.archive.org/web/20130509171339/http://receitasdafulaninha.blogspot.com.br/2011/11/tipos-de-macarrao.html#.UjtG4ax1HxU Tipos de macarrão.

==Regulations==

===Italy===
[[File:Pasta Machine.jpg|thumb|A small hand-cranked pasta machine, designed to sheet fresh pasta dough and cut [[tagliatelle]]]]
Although numerous variations of ingredients for different pasta products are known, in Italy the commercial manufacturing and labeling of pasta for sale as a food product within the country is highly regulated.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rules for the Review of Legislation on Production of Flour and Pasta|url=http://gazzette.comune.jesi.an.it/2001/117/2.htm|publisher=Italian Government Printing Office|access-date=7 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200648/http://gazzette.comune.jesi.an.it/2001/117/2.htm|archive-date=27 September 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Rules for the Review of Legislation on Production of Flour and Pasta (English Translation)|url=http://www.pasta-unafpa.org/pdf/ITALIA.pdf|publisher=Union of Organisations of Manufacturers of Pasta Products to the EU|access-date=7 July 2012|archive-date=4 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804002823/http://www.pasta-unafpa.org/pdf/ITALIA.pdf}}</ref> Italian regulations recognize three categories of commercially manufactured dried pasta as well as manufactured fresh and stabilized pasta:

* '''Pasta''', or '''dried pasta with three subcategories''' – (i.) durum wheat semolina pasta ({{lang|it|pasta di semola di grano duro}}), (ii.) Low grade durum wheat semolina pasta ({{lang|it|pasta di semolato di grano duro}}) and (iii.) Durum wheat whole meal pasta ({{lang|it|pasta di semola integrale di grano duro}}). Pastas made under this category must be made only with durum wheat semolina or durum wheat whole-meal semolina and water, with an allowance for up to 3% of soft-wheat flour as part of the durum flour. Dried pastas made under this category must be labeled according to the subcategory.
* '''Special pastas''' ({{lang|it|paste speciali}}) – as with the pasta above, with additional ingredients other than flour and water or eggs. Special pastas must be labeled as durum wheat semolina pasta on the packaging completed by mentioning the added ingredients used (e.g., spinach). The 3% soft flour limitation still applies.
* '''Egg pasta''' ({{lang|it|pasta all'uovo}}) – may only be manufactured using durum wheat semolina with at least 4 hens' eggs (chicken) weighing at least {{convert|200|g}} (without the shells) per kilogram of semolina, or a [[Breaker eggs|liquid egg]] product produced only with hen's eggs. Pasta made and sold in Italy under this category must be labeled egg pasta.
* '''Fresh and stabilized pastas''' ({{lang|it|paste alimentari fresche e stabilizzate}}) – includes fresh and stabilized pastas, which may be made with soft-wheat flour without restriction on the amount. Prepackaged fresh pasta must have a water content not less than 24%, must be stored refrigerated at a temperature of not more than {{cvt|4|C}} (with a {{cvt|2|C}} tolerance), must have undergone a heat treatment at least equivalent to pasteurisation, and must be sold within five days of the date of manufacture. Stabilized pasta has a lower allowed water content of 20%, and is manufactured using a process and heat treatment that allows it to be transported and stored at ambient temperatures.

The Italian regulations under Presidential Decree No. 187 apply only to the commercial manufacturing of pastas both made and sold within Italy. They are not applicable either to pasta made for export from Italy or to pastas imported into Italy from other countries. They also do not apply to pastas made in restaurants.

===United States===
In the US, regulations for commercial pasta products occur both at the federal and state levels. At the Federal level, consistent with Section 341 of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, Title 21, Chapter 9, S. IV, Sec. 341|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title21/pdf/USCODE-2010-title21-chap9-subchapIV-sec341.pdf|access-date=7 July 2012}}</ref> the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has defined [[Standards of identity for food|standards of identity]] for what are broadly termed ''macaroni products''. These standards appear in 21 ''[[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]]'' Part 139.<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Code of Federal Regulation, Title 21 Part 139|url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=7162819b59439ea6f4fd032034b15966&rgn=div5&view=text&node=21:2.0.1.1.26&idno=21#PartTop|access-date=7 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608021814/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=25d56e6aff7680cb5c9c0ef477c605a5&rgn=div5&view=text&node=21:2.0.1.1.26&idno=21#PartTop|archive-date=8 June 2010}}</ref> Those regulations state the requirements for standardized ''macaroni products'' of 15 specific types of dried pastas, including the ingredients and product-specific labeling for conforming products sold in the US, including imports:

* '''Macaroni products''' – defined as the class of food prepared by drying formed units of dough made from semolina, durum flour, farina, flour or any combination of those ingredients with water. Within this category various optional ingredients may also be used within specified ranges, including egg white, frozen egg white or dried egg white alone or in any combination; disodium phosphate; onions, celery, garlic or bay leaf, alone or in any combination; salt; gum gluten; and concentrated glyceryl monostearate. Specific dimensions are given for the shapes named macaroni, spaghetti and vermicelli.
** '''Enriched macaroni products''' – largely the same as ''macaroni products'' except that each such food must contain thiamin, riboflavin, niacin or niacinamide, folic acid and iron, with specified limits. Additional optional ingredients that may be added include vitamin D, calcium and defatted wheat germ. The optional ingredients specified may be supplied through the use of dried yeast, dried torula yeast, partly defatted wheat germ, enriched farina or enriched flour.
** '''Enriched macaroni products with fortified protein''' – similar to ''enriched macaroni products'' with the addition of other ingredients to meet specific protein requirements. Edible protein sources that may be used include food grade flours or meals from nonwheat cereals or oilseeds. Products in this category must include specified amounts of thiamin, riboflavin, niacin or niacinamide and iron, but not folic acid. The products in this category may also optionally contain up to {{convert|625|mg}} of calcium.
** '''Milk macaroni products''' – the same as ''macaroni products'' except that milk or a specified milk product is used as the sole moistening ingredient in preparing the dough. Other than milk, allowed milk products include concentrated milk, evaporated milk, dried milk and a mixture of butter with skim, concentrated skim, evaporated skim or nonfat dry milk, in any combination, with the limitation on the amount of milk solids relative to amount of milk fat.
** '''Nonfat milk macaroni products''' – the same as ''macaroni products'' except that nonfat dry milk or concentrated skim milk is used in preparing the dough. The finished macaroni product must contain between 12% and 25% milk solids-not-fat. Carageenan or carageenan salts may be added in specified amounts. The use of egg whites, disodium phosphate and gum gluten optionally allowed for ''macaroni products'' is not permitted for this category.
*** '''Enriched nonfat milk macaroni products''' – similar to ''nonfat milk macaroni products'' with added requirements that products in this category contain thiamin, riboflavin, niacin or niacinamide, folic acid and iron, all within specified ranges.
** '''Vegetable macaroni products''' – ''macaroni products'' except that tomato (of any red variety), artichoke, beet, carrot, parsley or spinach is added in a quantity such that the solids of the added component are at least 3% by weight of the finished macaroni product. The vegetable additions may be in the form of fresh, canned, dried or a puree or paste. The addition of either the various forms of egg whites or disodium phosphate allowed for ''macaroni products'' is not permitted in this category.
*** '''Enriched vegetable macaroni products''' – the same as ''vegetable macaroni products'' with the added requirement for nutrient content specified for ''enriched macaroni products''.
** '''Whole wheat macaroni products''' – similar to ''macaroni products'' except that only whole wheat flour or whole durum wheat flour, or both, may be used as the wheat ingredient. Further the addition of the various forms of egg whites, disodium phosphate and gum gluten are not permitted.
** '''Wheat and soy macaroni products''' – begins as ''macaroni products'' with the addition of at least 12.5% of soy flour as a fraction of the total soy and wheat flour used. The addition the various forms of egg whites and disodium phosphate are not permitted. Gum gluten may be added with a limitation that the total protein content derived from the combination of the flours and added gluten not exceed 13%.

====State mandates====
The federal regulations under 21 ''CFR'' Part 139 are standards for the products noted, not mandates. Following the FDA's standards, a number of states have, at various times, enacted their own statutes that serve as mandates for various forms of macaroni and noodle products that may be produced or sold within their borders. Many of these specifically require that the products sold within those states be of the enriched form.<ref>{{cite web|title=State of Connecticut General Provisions, Chapter 417, Sections 21a-28 (Pure Foods and Drugs)|url=http://www.cga.ct.gov/2011/pub/chap417.htm#Sec21a-28.htm|access-date=7 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811054040/http://www.cga.ct.gov/2011/pub/chap417.htm#Sec21a-28.htm|archive-date=11 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=State of Florida Statutes, Chapter 500.301–500.306 (Food Products)|url=https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2011/Chapter500/All|access-date=7 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Utah Administrative Codes – Rule R70-620.

====USDA school nutrition====
Beyond the FDA's standards and state statutes, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA), which regulates federal school nutrition programs,<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Code of Federal Regulation, Title 7, Part 210 – National School Lunch Program|url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=02dde6ef8db07a90198929f18099722e&rgn=div5&view=text&node=7:4.1.1.1.1&idno=7|publisher=GPO|access-date=7 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707140706/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=b27d439f6b2cf4ddd3e0c8aa8d035191&rgn=div5&view=text&node=7:4.1.1.1.1&idno=7|archive-date=7 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Code of Federal Regulation, Title 7, Part 220 – National School Breakfast Program|url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=e8e10bdc7e00e70d229a7e4a815ecdd1&rgn=div5&view=text&node=7:4.1.1.1.3&idno=7|publisher=GPO|access-date=7 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707140726/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=b27d439f6b2cf4ddd3e0c8aa8d035191&rgn=div5&view=text&node=7:4.1.1.1.3&idno=7|archive-date=7 July 2012}}</ref> broadly requires grain and bread products served under these programs either be [[Food fortification|enriched]] or [[whole grain]] (see 7 ''CFR'' 210.10 (k) (5)). This includes macaroni and noodle products that are served as part the category grains/breads requirements within those programs. The USDA also allows that enriched macaroni products [[Food fortification|fortified]] with protein may be used and counted to meet either a grains/breads or meat/alternative meat requirement, but not as both components within the same meal.<ref>{{cite web|title=USDA Buying Guide for Child Nutrition Programs – Grains and Bread |url=http://www.fns.usda.gov/tn/resources/FBG_Section_3-GrainsBreads.pdf |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |access-date=7 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513233642/http://www.fns.usda.gov/tn/resources/FBG_Section_3-GrainsBreads.pdf |archive-date=13 May 2013}}</ref>

==== 2025 tariffs ====
In November 2025, the [[United States Department of Commerce|U.S. Commerce Department]] imposed a 92% [[Dumping (pricing policy)|antidumping]] duty on pasta produced by 13 Italian companies, including [[La Molisana]], in addition to an existing 15% [[tariff]] on European Union imports. The combined duties, among the steepest enacted under the Trump administration, prompted major Italian exporters to consider withdrawing their pasta brands from U.S. markets due to high costs. The decision has sparked diplomatic tensions between Washington and Rome, with Italy contesting the tariffs as harmful to one of its most iconic industries.<ref>{{Cite web |last=WSJ |first=Margherita Stancati and Gavin Bade / Photography by Alessio Paduano for |date=2025-11-10 |title=Italian Pasta Is Poised to Disappear From American Grocery Shelves |url=https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/italy-pasta-trump-tariffs-e38d86a6 |access-date=2025-11-11 |website=The Wall Street Journal |language=en-US}}</ref>
