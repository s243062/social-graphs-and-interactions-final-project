'''Nihari''' ({{Langx|hi|निहारी}}; {{langx|bn|নিহারী}}; {{Langx|ur|{{Script|Nastaliq|نہاری}}}}) is a [[stew]] originating in [[Lucknow]], the capital of 18th-century [[Oudh State|Awadh]] under the [[Mughal Empire]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It consists of slow-cooked meat, mainly a [[Shank (meat)|shank cut]] of [[lamb and mutton]], or [[goat meat]], as well as [[Chicken as food|chicken]] and [[Bone marrow (food)|bone marrow]]. It is flavoured with [[Long pepper#Usage|long pepper]] ({{Transliteration|hi|pippali}}), a relative of [[black pepper]]. In [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]], nihari is often served and consumed with [[naan]].

== Etymology ==
The name {{Transliteration|hi|nihari}} originates from [[Arabic]] ''{{Transliteration|ar|nahâr}}'' ({{Langx|ar|نهار|label=none}}), meaning "morning";<ref name="NDTV"/><ref name="TOI"/><ref name="Hom">{{cite web|url=https://homtainment.com/beef-nihari-a-historical-recipe/|title=Nihari- historical recipe|date=23 December 2020|website=Homtainment|access-date=23 December 2020}}</ref> it was originally eaten by [[nawab]]s in the [[Mughal Empire]] as a breakfast course following [[Fajr prayer]].<ref name="NDTV">{{Cite news|last=Sengupta|first=Sushmita|date=3 January 2018|title=Nihari: History Of The Meaty and Buttery Breakfast Staple of The Mughals|url=https://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/nihari-history-of-the-meaty-and-buttery-breakfast-staple-of-the-mughals-1795358|access-date=3 January 2018 |work=NDTV Food}}</ref><ref name="Hom"/>

==History==
According to many sources, nihari originated in the royal kitchens of [[Lucknow]], [[Oudh State|Awadh]] (modern-day [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]]), in the late 18th century, during the last throes of the [[Mughal Empire]].<ref name="TOI">{{cite news|first=Deblina |last=Chakravorty |date=12 April 2012|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food/food-reviews/Nihari-a-gift-from-Nawabs/articleshow/11577016.cms|title=Nihari, a gift from Nawabs|work=The Times of India|access-date=5 March 2016}}</ref> It was originally meant to be consumed as a heavy, high-energy breakfast dish on an empty stomach by working-class citizens, particularly in colder climates and seasons. However, the dish later gained widespread popularity and eventually became a staple of the royal cuisine of Mughal-era [[nawab]]s.<ref>{{cite news |title=In celebration of winter's perfect dish, the mutton nihari! |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/brunch/in-celebration-of-winter-s-perfect-dish-the-mutton-nihari/story-aWAvsL8kFp5CKmk535PYDK.html |access-date=30 January 2021 |work=Hindustan Times |date=4 November 2017 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Do you know what is Nalli Nihari?

==Popularity==
Nihari is a traditional dish among the [[Islam in India|Indian Muslim]] communities of [[Lucknow]], [[Delhi]], and [[Bhopal]]. Following the [[partition of India]] in 1947, many [[Mahajir (Pakistan)|Urdu-speaking Muslims]] from [[North India|northern India]] migrated to [[Karachi]] in [[West Pakistan]] and [[Dhaka]] in [[East Pakistan]], and established a number of restaurants serving the dish. In Karachi, nihari became a large-scale success<ref name="th">{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/life/2007/05/25/stories/2007052500230300.htm|title=Nihari a la Mexican style|work=The Hindu Business Line|access-date=5 March 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523114642/http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/life/2007/05/25/stories/2007052500230300.htm|archive-date=23 May 2013|first1=Asif|last1=Noorani}}</ref> and soon spread in prominence and availability across [[Pakistan]].

In some restaurants, a few kilograms from each day's leftover nihari is added to the next day's pot; this reused portion of the dish is known as {{Transliteration|hi|taar}} and is believed to provide a unique flavour. Some nihari outlets in [[Old Delhi]] claim to have kept an unbroken cycle of ''{{Transliteration|hi|taar}}'' going for more than a century.<ref>{{cite web |last=Sengupta |first=Sushmita |date=20 January 2022 |url=https://www.slurrp.com/article/nihari%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98taar%E2%80%99-to-dahi%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98jamun%E2%80%99-the-desi-art-of-using-remains-of-previous-batch-to-flavour-next-1637066963216 |title=Nihari's 'Taar' to Dahi's 'Jamun': The Desi Art Of Using Remains Of Previous Batch To Flavour Next |work=Slurrp.com |access-date=22 December 2023 }}</ref>
