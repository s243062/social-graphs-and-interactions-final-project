'''''Num banhchok''''' ({{langx|km|នំបញ្ចុក}}, {{transliteration|km|num bânhchŏk}} {{IPA|km|nom ɓaɲcok}}) are lightly fermented [[Cambodian cuisine|Cambodian]] [[rice noodles]] and a breakfast noodle dish.<ref name="Dunston"/>

'''banhchok "បញ្ចុក"''' translates to "to feed" in [[Khmer language]].

== Preparation ==
''Num banhchok'' is made by soaking rice for 2–4 hours and grinding it into a liquidy paste. The paste is pressed into round shapes and dried inside [[calico]] bags. Then it is pulverized and turned into a viscous paste, which is [[extrusion|extruded]] into boiling water. The noodles are boiled for 3–4 minutes and transferred to cold water.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Khat |first=Leakhena |date=4 November 2017 |title=Num Banh Chok: More Than Just Rice Noodles to Khmer (video) |url=https://aecnewstoday.com/2017/num-banh-chok-more-than-just-rice-noodles-to-khmer/ |website=AEC News Today |access-date=14 November 2020}}</ref>

== Variations ==
There are many variations of ''num banhchok'' across the country.
*''Num banhchok samlor proher'' ({{lang|km|សម្លរប្រហើរនំបញ្ចុក}}) with a base made out of [[yellow kroeung|yellow]] or yellow-green ''kroeung'', pounded from either [[lemongrass]] stalks (for yellow ''kroeung'') or leaves (for [[green kroeung|green ''kroeung'']]), [[kaffir lime]] leaves and zest, [[garlic]], [[turmeric]], and [[fingerroot]], [[freshwater fish]] (usually [[snakehead (fish)|snakehead]]), ''[[prahok]]'' and [[coconut milk]] or [[coconut cream]].<ref name="Dunston"/>
*''Num banhchok Siem Reap'' ({{lang|km|នំបញ្ចុកសៀមរាប}}) shares the same ingredients as ''num banhchok samlor proher'', but has a thinner consistency when no coconut milk or coconut cream is added. Sometimes [[fish sauce#Cambodia|fish sauce]] is used to replace ''prahok'', while others argue that without ''prahok'' it's not ''num banhchok Siem Reap''.<ref name="Dunston"/>

== In folklore ==
{{Main|Thon Chey}}
''Num banhchok'' is featured in a popular Khmer [[folk legend]] about an influential revolutionary and scholar [[Thon Chey]] who was exiled to China by the [[Khmer kings|Khmer king]], where Thon Chey began making ''num banhchok'' to make a living. The dish quickly gained popularity among the Chinese and eventually attracted even the attention of the [[Chinese emperor]]. The emperor summoned Thon Chey to bring ''num banhchok'' to his palace. Thon Chey arrived and while the emperor was tasting the dish Thon Chey managed to see the emperor's face, comparing it to a dog and the face of his Khmer king to that of a bright full moon, for which Thon Chey was immediately thrown into jail. However, soon Thon Chey managed to get released and eventually returned to the [[Khmer Empire]].<ref>
