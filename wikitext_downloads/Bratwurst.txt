'''''Bratwurst''''' ({{IPA|de|ˈbʁaːtvʊʁst|lang|De-Bratwurst.ogg}}) is a type of [[German sausage]] made from [[pork]] or, less commonly, [[beef]], [[veal]], or any combination of beef, veal, and pork. The name is derived from the [[Old High German]] {{lang|goh|Brätwurst}}, from {{lang|goh|brät-}}, finely chopped meat, and {{lang|goh|Wurst}}, sausage, although in modern German it is often associated with the verb {{lang|de|braten}}, to pan fry or roast.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dict.leo.org/ende?lp=ende&search=braten |title=LEO Deutsch–Englisch Wörterbuch |access-date=2009-04-09}}</ref>

==History==
The first documented evidence of the ''Bratwurst'' in Germany dates to 1313 in the [[Franconia]]n city of [[Nuremberg]],<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.welt.de/regionales/muenchen/article119983539/Nuernberger-Bratwurst-Klassiker-wird-700-Jahre-alt.html |title=Nürnberger Bratwurst-Klassiker wird 700 Jahre alt |last=Tjiang |first=Thomas |date=September 13, 2013 |newspaper=Welt Online |access-date=September 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/weltspiegel/geschichte-der-bratwurst-neue-historische-quelle-ruft-streit-zwischen-thueringern-und-franken-hervor/153812.html |title=Geschichte der Bratwurst: Neue historische Quelle ruft Streit zwischen Thüringern und Franken hervor |work=Der Tagesspiegel Online |access-date=2016-09-04}}</ref> which is still internationally renowned for the production of grilling sausages.

How the sausages are served is also locally different, but most commonly they are regarded as a simple snack served with or in a white [[bread roll]] made from [[wheat]] flour and eaten with [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]]. As a pub dish, it is often accompanied by ''[[sauerkraut]]'' or [[potato salad]] and sometimes served with dark, crusty country bread made predominantly from [[rye]] flour, or less commonly with a {{Langx|de|Brezel|italic=default|label=none}} ([[pretzel]]). It is a very popular form of [[fast food]] in German-speaking countries, often cooked and sold by street vendors from small stands, and is also traditionally popular with fans at football games.

====Franconian varieties====
===== {{lang|de|Fränkische Bratwurst}} =====
[[File:2010.08.22.143425 Nürnberger Rostbratwurst Kirwa Sulzbach-Rosenberg.jpg|thumb|{{lang|de|Fränkische Bratwurst}}]]
The Franconian sausage is a relatively long ({{convert|10|–|20|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=1|disp=sqbr}}), thick, coarse sausage, common to the whole Franconian region with slight variations. It dates back to 1313.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} With [[marjoram]] as a characteristic ingredient, it is close in taste to the ''[[#Nürnberger Bratwurst|Nürnberger Bratwurst]]'' but juicier, due to its size and coarseness. The {{lang|de|Fränkische Bratwurst}} is traditionally served with sauerkraut or potato salad.

===== {{lang|de|Coburger Bratwurst}} =====
''Bratwurst'' originating in the city of [[Coburg]] in Franconia was first documented there in 1498.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bratwurstmuseum.de/geschichte.html |title=''1.

Traditionally, it is grilled over pinecones and served in a bread roll ({{lang|de|Brötchen}}).

===== {{lang|de|Kulmbacher Bratwurst}} =====
The {{lang|de|Kulmbacher Bratwurst}} is a finely-ground {{lang|de|Rohwurst}} from the city of [[Kulmbach]] in [[Upper Franconia]]. Long and thin, it is made mostly from very finely ground veal, with very little pork. This sausage may be seasoned with salt, white pepper, nutmeg, lemon peel, marjoram, caraway, and garlic. The exact mixture is a closely guarded trade secret of each butcher. {{lang|de|Kulmbacher ''Bratwurst''|italic=unset}} is usually pan-fried, or grilled over a wood fire. They are sold and served freshly grilled from vendors' stands in the {{lang|de|Marktplatz}}, in pairs, with or without mustard, on crusty rolls sprinkled with anise.

The small, thin bratwurst from Franconia's largest city, Nuremberg, was first documented in 1567; it is {{convert|7|to|9|cm|abbr=on}} long, and weighs between 20 and 25 g. The denominations {{lang|de|Nürnberger Bratwurst}} and {{lang|de|Nürnberger Rostbratwurst}} ({{lang|de|Rost}} comes from the grill above the cooking fire) are [[Protected Geographical Status|Protected Geographical Indications (PGI)]] under EU law since 2003,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003R1257:EN:NOT|title=Commission of the European Commission Regulation (EC) No 1257/2003|access-date=2009-04-18}}</ref> and may therefore only be produced in the city of Nürnberg, where an "Association for the Protection of ''Nürnberger Bratwürste''" was established in 1997.<ref>[http://www.nuernberger-bratwuerste.de/EN/index.php?m=Association&um= Schutzverband Nürnberger Bratwürste e.V.]</ref>

[[Pork]]-based and typically seasoned with fresh marjoram which gives them their distinctive flavour, these sausages are traditionally grilled over a beechwood fire. As a main dish six sausages are served on a [[pewter]] plate with either sauerkraut or potato salad, and accompanied by a dollop of horseradish or mustard. They are also sold as a snack by street vendors as {{lang|de|Drei im Weckla}} (three in a bun; the spelling {{lang|de|Drei im Weggla}} is also common, {{lang|de|Weggla}}/{{lang|de|Weckla}} being the word for "bread roll" in the Nuremberg dialect), with mustard.

Another way of cooking Nuremberg sausages is in a spiced vinegar and onion stock; this is called {{lang|de|[[Saure Zipfel|Blaue Zipfel]]}} (blue lobes).

===== {{lang|de|Würzburger Bratwurst}} =====
The {{lang|de|Würzburger Bratwurst}}, also known as the {{lang|de|Winzerbratwurst}}, comes from the city of [[Würzburg]] in Franconia. Its size is similar to the {{lang|de|Thüringer Rostbratwurst}}, but its ingredients include white wine from [[Franconia (wine region)|the region]].

===== {{lang|de|Thüringer Rostbratwurst}} =====
[[File:Rostbrater.JPG|thumb|{{lang|de|Thüringer Rostbratwürste}}]]
The {{lang|de|Thüringer Rostbratwurst}} is a thin, {{convert|15|–|20|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} long spiced sausage from [[Thuringia]]. It is notable for its low fat content (25% as compared to up to 60% in other sausages). In addition to salt and pepper, [[caraway]], [[marjoram]], and [[garlic]] are used for spicing. It is traditionally grilled over a charcoal fire and eaten with mustard and bread.<ref>{{cite news |first=Craig |last=Whtilock |title=Germans Take Pride in the Wurst |newspaper=The Washington Post |date= 2007-12-02|access-date=2007-12-02 |page= A27|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/01/AR2007120101513.html}}</ref>

Triggered by the discovery in 2000 of an account entry of 1404 first mentioning the ''Bratwurst'' in Thuringia in the town of [[Arnstadt]], the association "Friends of the ''Thuringian Bratwurst''" was founded in 2006. In the same year, the association established the {{lang|de|Erstes Deutsches Bratwurstmuseum}} {{Translation|First German Bratwurst Museum}} in the village of [[Wachsenburggemeinde|Holzhausen]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bratwurstmuseum.de/geschichte.html|title=Geschichte der Bratwurst - Bratwurstmuseum Holzhausen / Verein "Freunde der Thüringer Bratwurst e.V."|website=www.bratwurstmuseum.de|access-date=2016-09-04|archive-date=2020-08-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200811095342/https://www.bratwurstmuseum.de/geschichte.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===== {{lang|de|Rote Wurst}} =====
[[File:Rote Bratwürste auf einem Grillrost.JPG|thumb|{{lang|de|Rote Wurst}}]]
The {{langx|de|Rote Wurst|label=none}} (red sausage) is a favorite ''Bratwurst'' of the [[Swabia]]n region. It is similar to the ''[[Bockwurst]]'', and is made from finely ground pork and bacon, and has a spicy taste. To prevent splitting during grilling or pan frying, an X is cut into the ends of the sausage, which opens during cooking. Sometimes a row of x-shaped cuts are made along its length.

[[Wisconsin]], where the largest ancestry group is German, is known for its bratwursts.

Bratwurst was popularized in [[Sheboygan County, Wisconsin]], in the 1920s.  In general, each local butcher shop would take orders and hand make bratwurst fresh to be picked up on a particular day.  The fat content of the sausages was substantial, making daily pick up necessary to avoid spoilage; some of the fat is lost on cooking over charcoal.<ref>R. W. Apple, Jr. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/05/dining/the-meat-that-made-sheboygan-famous.html The Meat That Made Sheboygan Famous]", ''The New York Times'', June 5, 2002.

Bratwurst has also become popular as a mainstay of sports stadiums, especially baseball parks, after Bill Sperling introduced bratwurst to [[Major League Baseball]] in [[Milwaukee County Stadium]] in 1954, when the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]] moved to Milwaukee. The brats, which sold for 35&nbsp;cents, were grilled and placed into a container of a special tomato sauce with green pepper and onions before being served.<ref>Buz Swerkstrom.
