'''Moambe chicken''' ({{langx|fr|poulet à la moambe}} or simply {{lang|fr|poulet moambe}}, {{langx|pt|moamba de galinha}}) is a [[umami|savory]] [[Chicken (food)|chicken]] dish popular in [[Central Africa]] and considered the [[national dish]] of [[Angola]], [[Republic of the Congo|the Republic of the Congo]], and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|the Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. The dish itself is made by combining chicken, spices and palm butter to create a [[stew]]-like consistency.

==Popularity==
Moambe chicken is regarded as the [[national dish]] of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].<ref name="Long2015">{{cite book|author=Lucy M.

''Nsusu'' means ''chicken'' in [[Kikongo]]. It is also considered the national dish of [[Gabon]] where it is known as '''''poulet nyembwe''''', and in [[Angola]] where it is known as '''''{{lang|pt|moamba de galinha}}''''',<ref name=cnn/> although the Angolan dish was claimed by Brazilians around 2002, it has always been a popular dish in Angola, which makes sense as Angola and Congo are neighbours whilst although many Angolans live in Brazil, it was obviously introduced to Brazil by those with Angolan roots. This may also be why Moqueca is also very popular in Brazil but is actually an Angolan dish too. This is also why Brazil has its own version of pirão.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alan Davidson|title=The Penguin Companion to Food|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5DgAAAAMAAJ|year=2002|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-200163-9|page=24}}</ref> It is a common household dish in [[Belgium]].<ref name="Natermann2018">{{cite book|author=Diana Miryong Natermann|title=Pursuing Whiteness in the Colonies: Private Memories from the Congo Freestate and German East Africa (1884-1914)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=znZSDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA185|year=2018|publisher=Waxmann Verlag|isbn=978-3-8309-8690-4|page=185}}</ref> Angolan moamba chicken can be found in [[Portugal]].<ref name="Porter1970">{{cite book|author=Darwin Porter|title=Frommer's Portugal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QEosAQAAMAAJ|year=1970|publisher=Macmillan USA|isbn=978-0-471-77124-1|page=100}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://culinarybackstreets.com/cities-category/lisbon/2017/angola-lisbon-taste/|title=Angola in Lisbon: Taste|publisher=Culinary Backstreets|date=11 May 2017|access-date=12 Mar 2023}}</ref>
