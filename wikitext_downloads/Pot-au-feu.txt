{{lang|fr|'''Pot-au-feu'''}} ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɒ|t|oʊ|ˈ|f|ɜːr}}, {{IPAc-en|usalso|-|ˈ|f|ʌ}};<ref>{{cite OED|pot-au-feu}}; and {{Cite Merriam-Webster|pot-au-feu|accessdate=5 July 2019}}</ref> {{IPA|fr|pɔt‿o fø|lang|LL-Q150 (fra)-WikiLucas00-pot-au-feu.wav}}; {{literally|pot on the fire}}) is a [[French cuisine|French]] dish of slowly [[boiling|boiled]] meat and vegetables, usually served as two courses: first the [[broth]] (''bouillon'') and then the [[meat]] (''bouilli'') and [[vegetables]]. The dish is familiar throughout France and has many regional variations. The best-known have [[beef]] as the main meat, but [[pork]], [[chicken as food|chicken]], and [[sausage]] are also used.

==Background==
''[[The Oxford Companion to Food]]'' calls ''pot-au-feu'' "a [[dish (food)|dish]] symbolic of French cuisine and a meal in itself";<ref name=ocf>Hyman, p. 626</ref> the [[chef]] [[Raymond Blanc]] has called it "the quintessence of French family cuisine&nbsp;... the most celebrated dish in France, [which] honours the tables of the rich and poor alike";<ref name=rb>{{cite news|date=February 2011 |title=Vive La France! |url=http://www.raymondblanc.com/Portals/14/docs/OFM%20Feb%202011.pdf |url-status=dead |journal=Observer Food Monthly |publisher=The Observer |page=26|issue=112 |accessdate=31 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008053221/http://www.raymondblanc.com/Portals/14/docs/OFM%20Feb%202011.pdf |archivedate=8 October 2011}}</ref> and the American ''[[National Geographic]]'' magazine has termed it the [[national dish]] of France.<ref>{{Cite web|date=13 September 2011|title=Top 10 National Dishes – National Geographic|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/top-10/national-food-dishes/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014060413/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/top-10/national-food-dishes/|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 October 2016|access-date=8 August 2020|website=Travel|language=en}}</ref>

The ''[[Dictionnaire de l'Académie française]]'' dates the term ''pot-au-feu'' to the 17th century.<ref>[https://www.dictionnaire-academie.fr/article/A9P3663 "''pot-au-feu''"], ''Dictionnaire de l'Académie française''. Retrieved 30 January 2023</ref> <!-- Somewhere around here the term and its components should be translated into English. -->In 1600, the king of France, [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], declared, "there shall be no peasant in my kingdom who lacks the means to have a hen in his pot."{{refn|"N'y aura point de Laboureur en mon Royaume, qui n'ait moyen d'avoir une poule dans son pot."<ref>Péréfixe, p. 549</ref>|group=n}} A one-pot stew was a staple of French cooking, and the traditional recipe for ''poule-au-pot'' – also known as ''pot-au-feu à la béarnaise''<ref name="larousse">Montagné, pp. 904–905</ref> – resembles that for ''pot-au-feu''.<ref>[http://ja6.free.fr/fichiers/f1166.htm La poule au pot farcie de "nouste Henric" du Béarn], Cuisine Collection. Retrieved 30 January 2023</ref>{{refn|Such one-pot, slow-cooked stews were earlier called a ''"[[potpourri|pot-pourri]]"'': the term dates to at least 1564 in Middle French, and indicated a dish of mixed meats.<ref name=pp>{{cite OED|pot-pourri}}</ref> The term, which was taken up in England in the 1600s, is related to the Spanish and Portuguese ''[[olla podrida]]''.<ref name=pp/>|group=n}}

One batch of ''pot-au-feu'' was maintained as a [[perpetual stew]] in [[Perpignan]] from the 15th century until [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/06/garden/from-a-''pot-au-feu''-many-happy-returns.html | title=From, A ''pot-au-feu'', Many Happy Returns | work=New York Times | date=1981 | author=Prager, Arthur}}</ref>

==Ingredients ==
[[File:pot-au-feu ingrédients.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Some ''pot-au-feu'' ingredients: potato, [[beef shank|beef shin]], leek, carrot, celery, turnip and onion]]

The central ingredient in ''pot-au-feu'' is meat. Many recipes specify more than one cut of beef to give both the broth and the cooked meat the required flavour and consistency. [[Elizabeth David]] writes that [[beef shank|shin]], because of its gelatinous properties, is good for the ''[[:wiktionary:bouillon|bouillon]]'' but produces a mediocre ''[[:wiktionary:bouilli|bouilli]]'', whereas a cut such as [[Silverside (beef)|silverside]] cooks well for the ''bouilli''.<ref>David, pp. 138–139</ref> For a large ''pot-au-feu,'' it is practicable to use both those cuts or a mixture of others. [[Paul Bocuse]] calls for six different cuts: [[Blade steak|blade]], [[brisket]], [[entrecôte]], [[oxtail]], [[Rib steak|rib]], and shin.<ref name=pb/> Some recipes add a [[Bone marrow (food)|marrow bone]], to give marrow to spread on the bread served with the broth.<ref>David, p. 139; and Escoffier, p. 216</ref> Some recipes add [[liver (food)|ox liver]] to improve the clarity of the broth.<ref>David, p. 139</ref>

The inclusion of cabbage divides opinion; David comments that it is frequently encountered in France, but in her view, it "utterly wrecks" a ''pot-au-feu''; [[La bonne cuisine de Madame E. Saint-Ange|Madame Saint-Ange]] takes a similar view.{{refn|Saint-Ange and David suggest that if cabbage is to be served with a ''pot-au-feu'' it is cooked separately in a little of the bouillon from the main pot.<ref>David, p. 139; and Saint-Ange, p. 83</ref>|group=n}}  Blanc, [[Édouard de Pomiane]], and [[Auguste Escoffier]] include it;  Bocuse, [[Alain Ducasse]], and [[Joël Robuchon]] omit it,<ref name="rb" /><ref name="pb" /><ref>De Pomiane, p. 113; Ducasse, p. 305; Escoffier, p. 216; Montagné, pp. 904–905</ref><ref name="jr" /> as do [[Simone Beck]], [[Louisette Bertholle]], and [[Julia Child]], authors of ''[[Mastering the Art of French Cooking]]''.<ref name=bbc/> As well as a [[bouquet garni]] – traditionally made of [[parsley]], [[thyme]] and [[bay leaf|bay]]<ref name=sa/> – an onion studded with [[cloves]] may be added to the pot.<ref name=ocf/>

==Serving==
Generally, the broth (''bouillon'') is served first. It is often enriched with rice or pasta, and [[crouton]]s and grated cheese may be added, before it is served with [[French bread]].<ref name=ocf/> The meat (''bouilli'') and the vegetables are served next. Condiments may include, among other options, coarse salt, [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]], [[capers]], pickled [[gherkin]]s, pickled [[samphire]] and [[horseradish]] – grated or in a sauce.<ref>Montagné, p. 904; and [https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/''pot-au-feu''-367768 ''pot-au-feu''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230202111402/https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/ |date=2 February 2023 }}, ''Bon Appetit Test Kitchen'', epicutious.com. Retrieved 28 September 2021</ref>

Sauces served with the ''bouilli'' may include [[tomato sauce]], [[Sauce gribiche]], an [[Alsace|Alsacienne]] sauce (hard-boiled egg mayonnaise with herbs, capers and some of the bouillon), sauce Nénette<ref>see: [[Mastering the Art of French Cooking]]</ref> (cream reduced by simmering and flavoured with mustard and tomato), or sauce Suprême<ref>{{cite web |title=Chef Thomas Keller's Sauce Suprême Recipe |url=https://www.masterclass.com/articles/chef-thomas-kellers-sauce-supreme-recipe |website=MasterClass |access-date=13 September 2024 |date=2024}}</ref> (a [[velouté]] made with some of the bouillon and enriched with cream).<ref name=bbc/>

''Pot-au-feu'' broth may also be used for cooking vegetables or pasta. Ready-to-use concentrated cubes are also available.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.intermarche.com/recherche/knorr%20''pot-au-feu'' |title=InterMarche Express – Paris |access-date=28 September 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.carrefour.fr/p/bouillon-kub-''pot-au-feu''-maggi-7613033687914 |title=Carrefour online |access-date=28 September 2021}}</ref>

==Similar dishes==
Other countries have similar dishes with local ingredients. The Vietnamese dish [[pho]] has been said to be inspired by French cuisine in former [[French Indochina]], with a possible etymology for the name being a phonetic respelling of the French ''feu''.<ref>{{cite OED|pho}}</ref>
