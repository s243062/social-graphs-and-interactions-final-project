The fish or shellfish in ceviche is not served raw like [[sashimi]]; the [[citric acid]] from the citrus marinade causes the proteins in the seafood to become [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]], resulting in the dish appearing to be "cooked" without the application of heat. The fish is typically cured in [[lemon]] or sour [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] juice, although [[sour orange]] was historically used. The dressing also includes some local variety of [[chili pepper]] or [[Chili powder|chili]], replaced by [[Mustard seed|mustard]] in some parts of Central America. The marinade usually also includes sliced or chopped [[onion]]s and chopped [[Coriander|cilantro]], though in some regions such as Mexico, [[tomato]]es, [[avocado]]es, and [[tomato sauce]] may be included.<ref>{{cite web |title=3 recetas fáciles y deliciosas para hacer ceviche |url=https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/menu/3-recetas-faciles-y-deliciosas-para-hacer-ceviche/ |access-date=23 May 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Esto le sirvieron a Mónica Cabrejos cuando pidió ceviche y tiradito en Cancún |url=https://www.capital.com.pe/entretenimiento/esto-le-sirvieron-a-monica-cabrejos-cuando-pidio-ceviche-y-tiradito-en-cancun-noticia-1147514 |website=Radio Capital (Perú) |access-date=23 Dec 2018}}</ref>

Ceviche is often eaten as an [[appetizer]]; if eaten as a main dish, it is usually accompanied by side dishes that complement its flavors, such as [[sweet potato]], [[lettuce]], [[maize]], [[avocado]], or [[fried plantain]]s, among various other accompaniments.<ref name="EPI" /><ref>[[Ceviche#great ceviche|Rodriguez, ''The Great Ceviche Book'']], pp. 5–10</ref><ref name="Harrison, p. 85" />

== Etymology ==

The first documented evidence of the term {{lang|es|ceviche}} is from 1820, in the patriotic song "[[:es:La chicha|La Chicha]]," considered the first Peruvian national anthem.

According to the [[Royal Spanish Academy]], the word might have the same etymology as the Spanish term {{lang|es|[[escabeche]]}}, which derives from [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]] {{lang|mxi|izkebêch}}, in turn descending from [[Andalusian Arabic]] {{lang|xaa-Latn|assukkabáǧ}}, which also derives from [[Classical Arabic]] {{lang|ar-Latn|sakbāj}} ({{lang|ar|سكباج}},<ref>{{cite web |title=Cebiche |url=https://dle.rae.es/cebiche |website=DLE: Diccionario de la Lengua Española |publisher=Real Academia Española |access-date=30 August 2023}}</ref> meaning meat cooked in vinegar).<ref name="RAE-cebiche4">{{cite web |title=sebiche |work=Diccionario de la Lengua Española |publisher=[[Royal Spanish Academy]] |url=http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&LEMA=cebiche |access-date=2010-08-09 |archive-date=2012-02-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213143307/http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&LEMA=cebiche |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>Hans Wehr, ''Arabic–English Dictionary.''

The name of the dish is spelled variously as {{lang|es|cebiche}}, {{lang|es|ceviche}}, {{lang|es|seviche}}, or {{lang|es|sebiche}}, but the most common spelling is ''ceviche'' with ''v'', such as in Peru, which is an alternative spelling accepted by the Royal Spanish Academy.<ref name="RAE-cebiche1" /><ref name="RAE-cebiche3" /> There are also other local variants of the name, including {{lang|es|cerbiche}} and {{lang|es|serviche}}.<ref name="Harrison, p. 85">[[Ceviche#beyond gumbo|Harrison, ''Beyond Gumbo'']], p. 85</ref>

== History ==
Various explanations of the dish's origins exist, with Peruvian researchers favoring a pre-Hispanic origin. According to some historic sources from Peru, the [[Caral–Supe civilization|Caral civilization]] that developed in central Peru between 3500 BC to 1800 BC has left evidence of the use and consumption of raw [[Peruvian anchoveta|Peruvian anchovy]] with chili and salt, according to the investigations of archaeologist [[Ruth Shady]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=12 December 2023 |title=En Caral y Moche ya se servían ceviche|language=es |website=[[La República]]|url=https://larepublica.pe/cultural/2023/12/12/en-caral-y-moche-ya-se-servian-ceviche-gastronomia-peruana-patrimonio-cultural-unesco-historia-del-peru-991392|access-date=22 December 2023}}</ref> Another predecessor of ceviche originated among the [[Moche culture|Moche]], a coastal civilization that began to flourish in present-day northern Peru nearly 2,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite news |year = 2023 |url = https://www.tapasmagazine.es/en/this-is-the-origin-of-ceviche-perus-most-international-dish/ |author-first1=José Manuel|author-last1=Ruiz Blas|title = This is the origin of ceviche, Peru's most international dish |publisher = tapasmagazine.es |access-date = 29 February 2024}}</ref><ref name="EPI">{{cite news |date=September 19, 2008 |title=Perú decreta el 28 de Junio como el Día del Seviche |language=es |newspaper=El País Internacional |publisher=Ediciones El País, S.L. |location=Lima |url=http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2008/09/19/actualidad/1221775203_850215.html |url-status=live |access-date=August 28, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026183559/http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2008/09/19/actualidad/1221775203_850215.html |archive-date=October 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name="Dicc1">{{cite book| last = Zapata Acha| first = Sergio| publisher = Universidad San Martín de Porres| title = Diccionario de gastronomía peruana tradicional| edition = 1st|date=November 2006| location = Lima, Perú| isbn = 9972-54-155-X|language=es}}</ref> The Moche used the fermented juice from the local [[banana passionfruit]].<ref name="EPI"/> Recent investigations further show that during the [[Inca Empire]], fish was marinated with ''[[chicha]]'', an Andean [[fermented beverage]]. Different chronicles also report that along the [[Incan]] coast before the arrival of Spaniards, fish was consumed with salt and ''[[Ají (sauce)|ají]]''.<ref name="Dicc1" />

The dish is popular in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coastal regions of western [[South America]].<ref name="Ross, p. 171">[[#entre el comal|González and Ross, ''Entre el comal y la olla: fundamentos de gastronomía costarricense'']], p. 171</ref><ref name="EPI"/> The technique of macerating raw fish and meat in vinegar, citrus, and spices ([[escabeche]]) was brought to the Americas from Spain and is linked to the Muslim heritage in Spanish cuisine.

Nevertheless, some historians believe that ceviche originated during [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonial times]] in present-day Peru and Ecuador.<ref name="Rodriguez, p. 3">[[#great ceviche|Rodriguez, ''The Great Ceviche Book'']], p. 3</ref><ref name="Peschiera, p. 35">[[#peschiera|Peschiera, ''Cocina Peruana'']], p. 35</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Ecuadorian Ceviche|author= Mariuxi Prieto|website=weblogtheworld.com |date=15 September 2010 |url=https://weblogtheworld.com/countries/southern-america/ecuadorian-ceviche}}</ref> They propose that a predecessor to the dish{{specify|date=January 2023}} was brought to the area by [[Andalusia]]n women of [[Moors|Moorish]] background who accompanied the Conquistadors and that this dish eventually evolved into what is now considered ceviche.<ref name="Peschiera, p. 35" /><ref name="historiacocina.com">{{cite web | last =Ariansen Cespedes | first =Jaime | title =La facinante historia del Cebiche | work =Mito, Leyenda y Folklore en la Gastronomia Peruana VI | publisher =Instituto de los Andes | language =es | url =http://www.historiacocina.com/paises/articulos/peru/cebiche.html | access-date =August 28, 2013 | archive-date =August 5, 2018 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20180805142916/https://www.historiacocina.com/paises/articulos/peru/cebiche.html | url-status =live }}</ref> The Peruvian chef [[Gastón Acurio]] further explains that the dominant position that Lima held throughout four centuries as the capital of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], which at one point included most of western South America, allowed for popular dishes such as ceviche to be brought to other administrative provinces in the region, and in time becoming local cuisine incorporating regional flavors and styles.<ref name="Revolución">[[#Revolución|Revolución de los gustos en el Perú]] pp. 80–81</ref>

== Preparation and variants ==
Ceviche is marinated in a citrus-based mixture, with lemons and limes most commonly used. In addition to adding flavor, the citric acid causes the proteins in the seafood to become [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]], resulting in the dish appearing to be cooked without the application of heat. Because the dish is eaten raw and not cooked with heat, it must be prepared fresh and consumed immediately to minimize the risk of [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]].<ref name="Benson p. 78">[[Ceviche#LP peru|Benson et al. ''Peru'']] p. 78</ref> Acid marinades will not kill bacteria or parasitic worms, unlike the heat of cooking. Traditional-style ceviche was marinated for about three hours. Modern-style ceviche, popularized in the 1970s, usually has a very short marinating period. The appropriate fish can marinate in the time it takes to mix the ingredients, serve, and carry the ceviche to the table.<ref>{{cite web | title =Peruvian cuisine.

Accompaniments to ceviche vary greatly by region: in Ecuador, ceviche is served with [[fried plantain]]s, [[popcorn]], or [[tostones]]; in Colombia, Panama, and Guatemala, it is served with [[saltine cracker]]s, though in the north [[cookies]] or [[Toast (food)|toast]] are used as a garnish; in Mexico, it is served with corn [[Tostada (toast)|tostadas]] or crackers; in Panama, the spicy chombo chili pepper is sometimes added to taste; and in Peru, it is served with boiled root vegetables (such as [[sweet potato]]es, [[cassava]], or rarely [[potato]]es), grains or seeds such as boiled or roasted [[Maize|corn]], [[legume]]s, fried plantains, [[seaweed]], or [[lettuce]]; sometimes it can also be accompanied by ''chilcano'' (broth made from fish heads).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vera |first1=Milagros |date=28 June 2018 |title=Día del ceviche: un par de barras marinas para celebrar |url=https://elcomercio.pe/blog/checklistviajero/2018/06/dia-del-ceviche-un-par-de-barras-marinas-para-celebrar/ |access-date=23 May 2023 |website=elcomercio.pe}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Centoira |first1=Lucía |date=17 December 2015 |title=Aprende a preparar cocina peruana: ceviche clásico |url=https://www.elmundo.es/papel/gastro/2015/12/17/56715b7822601d363f8b4599.html |access-date=23 May 2023 |website=www.elmundo.es}}</ref>

[[Cilus gilberti|Corvina]] or cebo (sea bass) was the fish traditionally used. The mixture was traditionally marinated for several hours and served at room temperature, with chunks of corn on the cob and slices of cooked [[sweet potato]]. Regional or contemporary variations include garlic, fish bone broth, minced Peruvian ''ají limo'', or the Andean chili ''[[rocoto]]'', toasted corn or ''cancha'' and ''yuyo'' ([[Edible seaweed|seaweed]]). A specialty of [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]] is ceviche prepared from shark (''tollo'' or ''tojo''). ''Lenguado'' ([[Sole (fish)|sole]]) is often used in [[Lima]]. The modern version of Peruvian ceviche, similar to the method used in making Japanese [[sashimi]], consists of fish marinated for a few minutes and served promptly.

This great diversity has motivated chefs to create new types of ceviches.

The mixture is traditionally marinated for several hours and served with a bowl of toasted corn kernels as a side dish; fried green plantain chunks called "[[Tostones|patacones]]", or thinly sliced [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]] chips called ''[[chifle]]s''. In some regions, ceviche is served with rice on the side. Ceviches in Ecuador are seasoned with tomato sauce, mustard, and oil. The [[Manabí Province|Manabí
]] style, made with lemon juice, salt, and the juice provided by the cooked shrimp itself, and sometimes topped with peanut butter, is very popular. Occasionally, ceviche is made with various types of local shellfish, such as black [[clam]] (cooked or raw), [[oyster]]s (cooked or raw), [[spondylus]] (raw), [[barnacle]]s (cooked percebes), among others mostly cooked.  Well-cooked sea bass (corvina) or bicuda (picudo), octopus, and crab ceviches are also common in Ecuador. In all ceviches, red onion, lemon juice, cilantro, salt, and oil are ubiquitous ingredients.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Duarte-Casar |first1=Rodrigo |last2=Robalino-Vallejo |first2=Jessica |last3=Buzetta-Ricaurte |first3=María Fernanda |last4=Rojas-Le-Fort |first4=Marlene |title=Toward a characterization of Ecuadorian ceviche: much more than shrimp |journal=Journal of Ethnic Foods |date=12 May 2022 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=16 |doi=10.1186/s42779-022-00131-w|s2cid=248725703 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

=== North and Central America and the Caribbean ===
[[File:Alaskan ceviche.jpg|thumb|Alaskan ceviche made with Pacific [[halibut]], serrano peppers, cilantro and tomato]]

In Mexico, the U.S., and some parts of Central America, it is served either in cocktail cups with [[tostada (tortilla)|tostadas]] or as a tostada topping and taco filling. In Mexico, when served in a cup with tomato sauce, it is called a ceviche cocktail. [[Shrimp and prawn as food|Shrimp]], octopus, [[squid (food)|squid]], tuna, and [[Mackerel as food|mackerel]] are also popular bases for Mexican ceviche. The marinade ingredients include salt, [[lime (fruit)|lime]], onion, chili peppers, [[avocado]], and [[cilantro]] ([[coriander]]). Cut [[olive]]s and tomatoes are often added to the preparation.

In El Salvador and Nicaragua, one popular ceviche recipe is ''ceviche de concha negra'' ("black conch ceviche"), known in Mexico as ''pata de mula'' ("mule's foot"). It is dark, nearly black, with a distinct look and flavor. It is prepared with lime juice, onion, [[yerba buena]], salt, pepper, tomato, [[Worcestershire sauce]], and sometimes [[picante]] (any hot sauce or any kind of hot pepper) as desired.

The dish includes marinated fish, lime juice, salt, ground black pepper, finely minced onions, cilantro, and finely minced peppers in Nicaragua and Costa Rica. It is usually served in a cocktail glass with a lettuce leaf and soda crackers on the side, as in Mexico. Popular condiments are tomato [[ketchup]], [[mayonnaise]], and [[Tabasco sauce]]. The fish is typically tilapia or corvina, although [[mahi-mahi]], [[Shark meat|shark]], and [[marlin]] are also popular.

In Panama, ceviche is prepared with lemon juice, chopped onion, celery, cilantro, assorted peppers, and sea salt. Ceviche made with corvina (white sea bass) is very popular and is served as an appetizer in most local restaurants. It is also commonly prepared with octopus, shrimp, and [[squid (food)|squid]] or served with small pastry shells called "canastitas."

In the Caribbean, ceviche is often made using mahi-mahi prepared with lime juice, salt, onion, green pepper, [[habanero]], and a touch of [[allspice]]. Squid and tuna are also popular. In Puerto Rico and other places in the Caribbean, the dish is prepared with coconut milk. In the Bahamas and south Florida, a [[conch]] ceviche, conch salad, is popular. It is prepared by marinating diced fresh conch in lime, chopped onions, and [[bell pepper]]. Diced [[pequin pepper]] or [[Scotch bonnet pepper]] is often added for spice. In south Florida, it is common to encounter a variation to which tomato juice has been added.

== UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity ==
In December 2023, the practices and meanings associated with the preparation and consumption of ceviche, were recognized by [[UNESCO]] as an expression of [[Peruvian cuisine|Peruvian traditional cuisine]] and an [[Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]]. The statement was made within the framework of the eighteenth session of its Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage. As a basis for its decision, it was considered that the preparation and consumption of ceviche in Peru, "entail specific practices, knowledge and meanings at each stage, from fishing to cultivating the ingredients and preparing the dish. As recipes vary from one region to the next, the dish also strengthens regional cultural identity".<ref>{{cite web |title=Practices and meanings associated with the preparation and consumption of ceviche, an expression of Peruvian traditional cuisine |url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/practices-and-meanings-associated-with-the-preparation-and-consumption-of-ceviche-an-expression-of-peruvian-traditional-cuisine-01952 |access-date=2024-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=UNESCO - Traditional knowledge and practices for the making and consumption of cassava bread |url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/traditional-knowledge-and-practices-for-the-making-and-consumption-of-cassava-bread-02118}}</ref>

In awarding the honor to Peru's ceviche, UNESCO highlighted the role of the dish in Peru's cultural identity, the importance of artisanal sustainable fishers and traditional female ceviche cooks in cevicherías, regional variations of the dish, and how the knowledge of ingredients and techniques are passed down through families in Peru.<ref>{{cite web | last1=Read | first1=Johanna |title=UNESCO Names Peru's Ceviche Intangible Cultural Heritage |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/johannaread/2024/02/22/unesco-names-perus-ceviche-as-intangible-cultural-heritage/?sh=3f5b34895677 |access-date=2024-02-27 |website=[[Forbes]]}}</ref>
