'''Gibanica''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|гибаница}}, {{IPA|sr|ˈɡibanit͡sa|pron}}) is a traditional pastry dish popular all over the [[Balkans]]. It is usually made with cottage cheese and eggs. Recipes can range from sweet to savoury, and from simple to festive and elaborate [[multi-layered cake]]s.

The pastry was mentioned in [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]]'s ''[[Srpski rječnik|Serbian Dictionary]]'' in 1818 and by a Slovenian priest Jožef Kosič in 1828, where it was described as a special Slovenian cake which is "a must at wedding festivities and is also served to workers after finishing a big project".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.visitljubljana.com/en/visitors/stories/what-is-prekmurska-gibanica-cake-and-what-makes-it-so-special/| title=Prekmurska gibanica|language=en|publisher=visitljubljana.com| access-date=21 March 2018}}</ref> It is a type of layered [[strudel]], a combination of Turkish and Austrian influences in different cuisines of the former [[Yugoslavia]]. Today the versions of this cake can be found in [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]], [[Bosnia]], [[North Macedonia]] and other regions of the former Yugoslavia. Variants of this rich layered strudel are found in [[Hungary]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Greece]], [[Turkey]], [[Romania]], and [[Syria]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Gibanica |url=http://www.cliffordawright.com/caw/recipes/display/bycountry.php/recipe_id/1032/id/20/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221127112013/https://www.cliffordawright.com/caw/recipes/display/bycountry.php/recipe_id/1032/id/20/ |archive-date=27 November 2022 |access-date=25 March 2018 |publisher=cliffordawright.com |language=en}}</ref>{{Better source needed|reason=The current source is insufficiently reliable ([[WP:NOTRS]]).|date=August 2025}}

Gibanica may sometimes also refer to a [[nut roll|walnut roll]], which is a sweet bread with a spiral of walnut paste rolled up inside.

==Etymology==
In the vocabulary of the Yugoslav Academy, as well as in the etymological dictionary of [[Slavic languages]], the word ''gibanica'' is a derivative of the [[Serbo-Croatian]] verb [[wikt:gibati#Serbo-Croatian|gíbati/гибати]], which means "to fold; sway, swing, rock". There are also derivatives like the word {{lang|sh|gibaničar}}/гибаничар – one who makes gibanica, one who loves to eat gibanica, and one who always imposes as a guest and at someone else's expense.{{sfn|Republika 2003}}

The Yugoslav ethnologist Milenko Filipović theorized that ''gibanica'' instead came from the Egyptian Arabic word ''gebna'' (جبنة), referring to a soft, white, salty variety of [[Egyptian cheese]] that is similar to the cheese used for gibanica.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.republika.co.rs/306-307/26.html| title=Gibanica|language=sr|publisher=republika.co.rs| access-date=25 March 2018}}</ref>

==Preparation==
The original recipe for gibanica included traditionally homemade [[phyllo]] dough and cow's milk cheese. Homemade cheese can be [[feta]] or [[sirene]]. The pie is usually made as ''gužvara'' (crumpled pie), so the phyllo dough in the middle is crumpled and filled. Besides cheese, the filling contains eggs, milk, [[kaymak]], [[lard]], salt and water. Also, stuffing may include [[spinach]], meat, [[Urtica dioica|nettle]], potato and onion. To speed up preparation, purchased phyllo dough can be used and [[sunflower oil]] or [[olive oil]] can be used instead of lard.{{sfn|Serbia.com 2012}}

Many varieties of gibanica and related dishes can be found throughout the Balkans; different gibanica are known as part of the national cuisines of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Slovenia]], and [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] (Italy, where it is called ''ghibanizza''<ref>{{cite book|first1=Marzia|last1=Bonetti|first2=Claudio|last2=Fabbro|first3=Walter|last3=Filiputti|title=Enovagando: Friuli-Venezia Giulia : economia, turismo e cultura|publisher=Digi Press|year=2000|location=Gorizia|page=89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t-tJAAAAYAAJ&q=ghibanizza}}</ref>), [[Greece]], and [[Bulgaria]], where it is usually called ''[[Banitsa (pastry)|banitsa]]''.{{sfn|Republika 2003}} Recipes can range from sweet to savoury, and from simple to festive and elaborate [[layer cake|multi-layered cakes]].{{sfn|Serbia.com 2012}} The so-called "chetnik gibanica" is the fatter, greasier version; it received the name after World War II.<ref>{{cite web|title=Recept za najbolju gibanicu|website=bastabalkana.com|date=18 February 2017 |url=https://www.bastabalkana.com/2017/02/recept-za-najbolju-gibanicu-kako-se-pravi-srpska-gibanica/}}</ref>

From the basic recipe, many local specialties have evolved. [[Prekmurska gibanica]], for example, is a "fancy" multi-layered cake from [[Prekmurje]] in Slovenia, served as a dessert course on festive occasions.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.slovenia.info/en/Dishes-and-Recipes/Prekmurska-gibanica.htm?recepti=8822&lng=2| title=Prekmurska gibanica|publisher=slovenia.info | access-date=21 March 2013}}</ref> [[Međimurska gibanica]], from the neighbouring [[Međimurje]] region of Croatia, is a closely related but simpler and less "formal" dish consisting of four layers of fillings (prepared fresh cheese ([[Quark (cheese)|quark]]), poppyseed, apple and walnut).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.medjimurski-dvori.hr/med_gibanica.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424093154/http://www.medjimurski-dvori.hr/med_gibanica.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 April 2012 |title=Međimurska gibanica |language=hr |publisher=medjimurski-dvori.hr |access-date=21 March 2013 }}</ref> Another gibanica variety, called [[Prleška gibanica]], is known from [[Prlekija]] to the west of the [[Mur River]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.slovenia.info/en/recepti/Prleška-gibanica.htm?recepti=9835&lng=2| title=Prleška gibanica|publisher=slovenia.info | access-date=21 March 2013}}</ref>

The basic concept of gibanica, a cake or pie involving a combination of pastry with cheese in differentiated layers often combined with layers of various other fillings, is common in the cuisines of the Balkans, [[Anatolia]], and the [[Eastern Mediterranean]]. For example, a similar dish known as shabiyat (sh'abiyat, shaabiyat) is part of the cuisine of [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.justapinch.com/recipes/dessert/pudding/shaabiyat.html| title=Shaabiyat|publisher=justapinch.com | access-date=21 March 2013}}</ref> Gibanica can also be considered to resemble a type of cheese [[strudel]], with which it likely shares a common ancestry in the pastry dishes of the region, and the cuisines of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires.{{Cn|date=March 2025}}
