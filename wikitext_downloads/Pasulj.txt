In [[Bulgaria]] it is known as "bob" or "bob chorba", which literally means "beans" or "bean soup". It can be in the form of a soup or with less liquid and baked. In [[North Macedonia]], a spicy and thicker variant is known as [[tavče gravče]] ({{lang|mk|Тавче гравче}}; beans on a [[Frying pan|skillet]]), and greens such as celery and cabbage are often added. In [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Croatia]], [[kajmak]], a type of thick clotted cream is often added. The dish is believed to have roots in the Ottoman Empire, with the Turks believed to have brought beans to the Balkans.<ref>{{cite web |title=All about Pasulj.
