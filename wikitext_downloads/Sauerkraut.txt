==Overview and history==
[[File:Kiszona kapusta.JPG|thumb|left|Polish ''kapusta kiszona'']]
[[Fermentation|Fermented]] foods have a long history in many cultures. The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] writers [[Cato the Elder|Cato]] (in his ''[[De agri cultura]]'') and [[Columella]] (in his ''[[Columella#De re Rustica|De re Rustica]]'') mentioned preserving cabbages and [[turnips]] with salt. According to Wilhelm Holzapfel et al., Plinius the Elder, writing in the first century AD, is reputed to have been the first writer to describe the making of sauerkraut by preserving what the Romans called ''salt cabbage'' in earthen vessels.<ref name="Holzapfel2003">{{cite book |last1=Holzapfel |first1=Wilhelm |last2=Schillinger |first2=Ulrich |last3=Buckenhüskes |first3=Herbert |editor1-last=Farnworth |editor1-first=Edward R. |title=Handbook of Fermented Functional Foods |year=2003 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-203-00972-7 |page=343 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7LYHFGLJQNQC&pg=PA343 |chapter=Sauerkraut}}</ref> Popular folklore has imagined that sauerkraut was introduced to Europe by the [[Pax Mongolica#Trade network|trade networks formed across Eurasia]] by the [[Golden Horde]]. However, according to Mack and Surina (2005), there is no evidence to support this theory, nor any evidence that fermented cabbage arrived from an East Asian source, and there is evidence of sauerkraut production in Europe dating back to the early period of the [[Western Roman Empire]].<ref name="Return of the Mack">{{cite book |last1=Mack |first1=Glenn Randall |last2=Surina |first2=Asele |title=Food Culture in Russia and Central Asia |date=30 June 2005 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-0-313-32773-5 |pages=78–79 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j7MTx_zcIR0C&pg=PA78 |language=en}}</ref>

Before [[frozen food]]s, refrigeration, and cheap transport from warmer areas became readily available in [[Northern Europe|Northern]], [[Central Europe|Central]], and [[Eastern Europe]], sauerkraut – like other preserved foods – provided a source of certain nutrients (eg, [[vitamin C]]) during the winter. Captain [[James Cook]] always took a store of sauerkraut on his sea voyages, since experience had taught him it prevented [[scurvy]].<ref name="O'Sullivan2008">{{cite book |last1=O'Sullivan |first1=Dan |title=In Search of Captain Cook: Exploring the Man Through His Own Words |year=2008 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-0-85771-350-6 |page=115 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y7WKDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA115}}</ref><ref name="Makepeace2018">{{cite web |last1=Makepeace |first1=Margaret |work=British Library Western Heritage Collection |title=Sauerkraut, sugar, and salt pork – the diet on board Cook's 'Resolution' |url=https://blogs.bl.uk/untoldlives/2018/06/sauerkraut-sugar-and-salt-pork-the-diet-on-board-cooks-resolution.html |access-date=20 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240520214000/https://blogs.bl.uk/untoldlives/2018/06/sauerkraut-sugar-and-salt-pork-the-diet-on-board-cooks-resolution.html |archive-date=20 May 2024 |date=12 June 2018 |url-status=bot: unknown }}</ref>

==Production==
[[File:Saurkraut (cropped).JPG|thumb|Homemade sauerkraut]]
Sauerkraut is made by a process of [[pickling]] called [[lactic acid fermentation]], analogous to how traditional (not heat-treated) [[pickled cucumber]]s and [[kimchi]] are made. The cabbage is finely shredded, layered with salt, and left to ferment. Fully cured sauerkraut keeps for several months in an airtight container stored at 15&nbsp;°C (60&nbsp;°F) or below. In temperate climates, this allows storage over the full winter and early-spring. Neither refrigeration nor [[pasteurization]] is required, although these treatments prolong storage life.{{cn|date=October 2024}}

Fermentation by [[Lactobacillus|lactobacilli]] is introduced naturally, as these air-borne bacteria culture on raw cabbage leaves where they grow. Yeasts also are present, and may yield soft sauerkraut of poor flavor when the fermentation temperature is too high. The fermentation process has three phases, collectively sometimes referred to as population dynamics. In the first phase, [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] bacteria such as ''[[Klebsiella]]'' and ''[[Enterobacter]]'' lead the fermentation, and begin producing an acidic environment that favors later bacteria. The second phase starts as the acid levels become too high for many bacteria, and ''[[Leuconostoc mesenteroides]]'' and other ''Leuconostoc'' species take dominance. In the third phase, various ''Lactobacillus'' species, including ''[[Lactobacillus brevis|L. brevis]]'' and ''[[Lactobacillus plantarum|L. plantarum]]'', ferment any remaining sugars, further lowering the [[pH]].<ref>The pH of completely cured sauerkraut is about 3.6; see {{cite book |title=Food Chemistry |first1=H.-D. |last1=Belitz |first2=Werner |last2=Grosch |first3=Peter |last3=Schieberle |publisher=Springer |year=2009 |isbn=9783540699330 |page=803 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xteiARU46SQC&pg=PA803|edition=4th }}</ref> Properly cured sauerkraut is sufficiently [[acidic]] to prevent a favorable environment for the growth of ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]'', the toxins of which cause [[botulism]].<ref name="farnworth1"/><ref name="fao1"/>

A 2004 [[Genomics|genomic]] study found an unexpectedly large diversity of lactic acid bacteria in sauerkraut, and that previous studies had oversimplified this diversity. ''[[Weissella]]'' was found to be a major organism in the initial, heterofermentative stage, up to day 7. It was also found that ''[[Lactobacillus brevis]]'' and ''[[Pediococcus]] pentosaceus'' had smaller population numbers in the first 14 days than previous studies had reported.<ref>{{cite journal |author=F. BREIDT, JR. |title=A Genomic Study of ''Leuconostoc mesenteroides'' and the Molecular Ecology of Sauerkraut Fermentations |journal=Journal of Food Science |volume=69 |issue=1 |pages=30–33 |year=2004 |url=http://ddr.nal.usda.gov/bitstream/10113/15889/1/IND43655692.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120916131706/http://ddr.nal.usda.gov/bitstream/10113/15889/1/IND43655692.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 September 2012 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2621.2004.tb17874.x |access-date=2011-01-19}}</ref>

The Dutch sauerkraut industry found that combining a new batch of sauerkraut with an old batch resulted in an exceedingly sour product. This [[sourdough]] process is known as "backslopping" or "inoculum enrichment"; when used in making sauerkraut, first- and second-stage population dynamics, important to developing flavor, are bypassed. This is due primarily to the greater initial activity of species ''L. plantarum''.<ref>{{cite book

In [[Armenian cuisine|Armenian]], [[Belarusian cuisine|Belarusian]], [[Estonian cuisine|Estonian]], [[Latvian cuisine|Latvian]], [[Lithuanian cuisine|Lithuanian]], [[Czech cuisine|Czech]], [[Slovak cuisine|Slovak]], [[Polish cuisine|Polish]], [[Russian cuisine|Russian]], and [[Ukrainian cuisine]], chopped cabbage is often pickled together with shredded [[carrot]]s. Other ingredients may include [[caraway]] seeds, whole or quartered [[apple]]s for additional flavor or [[cranberry]] for flavor and better keeping (the [[benzoic acid]] in cranberries is a common preservative). [[Bell pepper]]s and [[beets]] are added in some recipes for color. The resulting sauerkraut salad is typically served cold, as ''[[zakuski]]'' or a side dish.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Villa|first=Susie Hoogasian|title=[[Armenian Village Life Before 1914]]|date=1982|publisher=Wayne State University Press|page=54|quote=Cabbage and mixed vegetable pickles, made in large quantities, and stored in earthenware jars, were very popular.

A homemade type of very mild sauerkraut is available, where white cabbage is pickled with salt in a refrigerator for only three to seven days. This process results in very little lactic acid production. Sometimes in Russia double fermentation is used, with the initial step producing an exceptionally sour product, which is then "corrected" by adding 30–50% more fresh cabbage and fermenting the mix again. The flavor additives like apples, beets, cranberries, and sometimes even [[watermelon]]s are usually introduced at this step.{{cn|date=October 2024}}

Sauerkraut may be used as a filling for [[Polish cuisine|Polish]] ''[[pierogi]]'', Ukrainian ''[[varenyky]]'', Russian ''[[pirog]]i'' and ''[[pirozhki]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tastingpoland.com/food/pierogi.html|title=Pierogi - the best guide to the most popular Polish food|website=www.tastingpoland.com}}</ref> Sauerkraut is also the central ingredient in traditional soups, such as ''[[shchi]]'' (a [[national dish]] of Russia), ''[[cabbage soup|kwaśnica]]'' (Poland), ''[[Cabbage soup|kapustnica]]'' ([[Slovak cuisine|Slovakia]]), and ''[[Cabbage soup|zelňačka]]'' ([[Czech cuisine|Czech Republic]] resp.

In [[South Tyrol]], it is made with juniper berries, [[extra-virgin olive oil]] and smoked [[pancetta]]. Traditionally it is served warm, with pork (e.g. ''[[eisbein]]'', ''[[schweinshaxe]]'', ''[[Kassler]]'') or [[sausage]]s (smoked or fried sausages, ''[[Frankfurter Würstchen]]'', [[Vienna sausage]]s, [[black pudding]]), accompanied typically by roasted or steamed potatoes or dumplings (''[[knödel]]'' or ''[[schupfnudel]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goethe.de/ins/gb/lp/prj/mtg/typ/sau/en5653632.htm |title=Meet the Germans – Typically German - The Germans and ... - Sauerkraut - Goethe-Institut |publisher=Goethe.de |access-date=2013-04-13}}</ref> Similar recipes are common in other Central European cuisines. The [[Czech cuisine|Czech]] [[national dish]] ''vepřo knedlo zelo'' consists of roast pork with ''[[Knödel|knedliky]]'' and sauerkraut.

In Bulgaria, Montenegro, Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia, North Macedonia and Slovenia, usually the [[Whole sour cabbage|whole cabbage heads are pickled]]. Such produce is used for many dishes, from a simple salad made of chopped cabbage and sprinkled with paprika, to cabbage rolls. In Bulgarian cuisine sauerkraut is known as кисело зеле, and many traditional Bulgarian dishes are made with sauerkraut, like свинско със зеле (pork with sauerkraut), сарми (cabbage rolls), зелник (Bulgarian banitsa with sauerkraut), капама (sausage and meat with cabbage rolls and sauerkraut in clay pot), боб със зеле (beans with sauerkraut) and салата от кисело зеле с червен пипер (sauerkraut salad with paprika).  In northern parts of Serbia and Croatia, it is often added to bean soup. In central Serbia, a local specialty called "[[wedding cabbage]]" is made by slowly stewing roughly cut cabbage with at least three kinds of meats, lean, fatty, and smoked.

In [[Székely Land|Szeklerland]] it is an essential part of ''székelygulyás'' and the ''erdélyi rakott káposzta'' (a type of casserole).

In [[Romania]], the local type of sauerkraut ("[https://ziarulunirea.ro/varza-murata-sursa-de-probiotice-si-singurul-aliment-vegetal-care-contine-vitamina-b12-611179/ varza murata]", whole pickled cabbage heads) are used as wrap for the national dish called "[[sarmale]]", a Turkish-inspired roll, made of pickled cabbage leaves with minced pork and rice, having its own personality and very distinct in taste from its Ottoman predecessor.{{cn|date=October 2024}}

In [[France]], sauerkraut is the main ingredient of the [[Alsatian cuisine|Alsatian]] meal ''[[choucroute garnie]]'' ([[French language|French]] for 'dressed sauerkraut'), sauerkraut with sausages (Strasbourg sausages, smoked [[Morteau Sausage|Morteau]] or [[Montbéliard]] sausages), [[charcuterie]] (bacon, ham, etc.), and often [[potato]]es.{{cn|date=October 2024}}

In [[Chile]] it is called ''chucrut'' and is a common topping for sandwiches and hotdogs, especially for [[completo]]s.{{cn|date=October 2024}}

===Disadvantages===

Excessive consumption of sauerkraut may lead to [[bloating]] and [[flatulence]] due to the [[trisaccharide]] [[raffinose]], which the human [[small intestine]] cannot break down. This does not negatively affect long-term health, although it might be uncomfortable.<ref name="St. John2011">{{cite web|last=St. John |first=Tina|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/463167-can-you-eat-too-much-sauerkraut/|title=Can You Eat Too Much Sauerkraut?|publisher=Livestrong.com |date=5 June 2011 |access-date=24 June 2013}}</ref> Additionally, sauerkraut has a very high [[Salt|sodium]] content.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Busch |first=Sandi |title=Sauerkraut & Sodium |url=https://www.livestrong.com/article/519491-sauerkraut-sodium/ |access-date=2021-03-15 |website=LIVESTRONG.COM |language=en}}</ref>
