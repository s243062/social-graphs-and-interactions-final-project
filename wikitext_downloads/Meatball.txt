Soft meatballs used in Scandinavia or the ones that are put into the soup are called ''húsgolyó'' or ''húsgombóc'' in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]].]]In [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungary]], as well as territories from neighbouring countries where Hungarian is spoken, a meatball is called ''vagdalt'' or ''fasírt'' {{IPA|hu|ˈfɒʃiːrt|}} or ''fasírozott'' {{IPA|hu|ˈfɒʃiːrozott|}} probably coming from Austrian German ''faschierte Laibchen''. It is a mixture of minced pork, minced onions, garlic, paprika, salt and breadcrumbs, deep fried in oil or pork fat and eaten with potatoes or [[főzelék]]. Also, the ''májgombóc'' {{IPA|hu|ˈmaːjɡomboːt͡s|}} (liver dumpling) is popular in soups.

''Pulpety'' or ''klopsy'' are usually made from seasoned ground meat with onion and mixed with eggs and either breadcrumbs or wheat rolls soaked in milk or water. Fried ''pulpety'' are larger than typical cooked ones. They can be round or flat in shape. The latter, in many countries, would be considered a cross between a meatball and a hamburger.

*In [[Russian cuisine|Russia]], they are called ''kotlety'' ({{langx|ru|котлеты}}) in flat forms or ''tefteli'' ({{langx|ru|тефтели}}) in ball forms.

{{Main|Kofta}}
[[File:Koofteh tabrizi.jpg|thumb|''[[Kufte Tabrīzī]]'']]
''Kofta'' is a type of meatball or [[dumpling]] that is widely distributed in [[Middle East]]ern, [[South Asian]], [[Mediterranean]] and [[Balkan]] (Central and Eastern Europe) cuisines. The word ''kofta'' is derived from [[Persian language|Persian]] ''kūfta'': In Persian, کوفتن (kuftan) means "to beat" or "to grind" or 'meatball'.<ref>[[Alan S. Kaye]], "Persian loanwords in English", ''English Today'' '''20''':20-24 (2004), {{doi|10.1017/S0266078404004043}}.</ref> In the simplest form, koftas consist of balls or fingers of minced or [[ground meat]] – usually [[beef]] or [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] – mixed with spices and/or onions and other ingredients. The vegetarian variety is popular in India. They can be grilled, fried, steamed, poached, baked or marinated, and may be served with a rich spicy sauce.
*In [[Afghan cuisine|Afghanistan]], meatballs are used as a traditional dish with homemade soups or are made with a tomato-based sauce that may include some plum seeds to increase tartness and is served with bread or rice which is called ''Kofta-Chelou''. Nowadays meatballs are also grilled on top of [[pizza]].
*In [[Iranian cuisine|Iran]], several types of meatballs are consumed. If they are cooked in a stew, they are called ''kufteh.'' If they are fried (typically small meatballs), they are called ''kal-e gonjeshki'' (literally "[[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]'s head"). Both types are consumed with either bread or rice. Typically, herbs are added, and for ''kufteh'', usually the meatball is filled with hard boiled eggs or dried fruits. There are several (at least 10) types; the most famous is "[[kufte Tabrīzī]]", traditionally from [[Tabriz]] in northwestern Iran.
*In [[Israeli cuisine|Israel]], meatballs are called ktzitzot basar ({{langx|he|קציצות בשר}}), or sometimes simply ktzitzot ({{langx|he|קציצות}}). Their exact ingredients and preparation vary widely, due to the influence of Jewish immigration from different regions. They are typically made of spiced ground beef, though turkey and chicken versions are also available, and in their common form, they are shaped as slightly flattened balls, pan fried and then cooked in tomato sauce or broth. Other variations also exist, including the [[Gondi (dumpling)|gondi]], which were brought by the [[Persian Jews]], the albondigas of the [[Sephardic cuisine]], and the kufta that is customary with some [[Mizrahi Jews]].
*Meatballs are popular in [[South Asian cuisine]]. In [[Indian National Congress|India]], vegetarian versions of koftas are made with paneer, potato, bottle gourd, raw banana or other vegetables. South Asian meatballs are normally cooked in a spicy curry. In [[Pakistani cuisine|Pakistan]], they are cooked in a gravy called ''chorba.'' Sometimes whole pre-boiled eggs are added, and sometimes the eggs are encased in a layer of the kofta meat to make something resembling a [[Scotch egg]]. These kofta dishes are very popular with Indian diaspora and are available in many Indian restaurants.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-08-27 |title=Malai Kofta Recipe {{!}} Paneer Kofta Curry |url=https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/malai-kofta-recipe/ |access-date=2022-04-23 |website=Swasthi's Recipes |language=en-US}}</ref>

*[[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] meatballs (''wanzi'') are typically made of pork and can be steamed, boiled or deep-fried, sometimes with the addition of [[soy sauce]]. Large meatballs, called [[lion's head (food)|lion's heads]], can range in size from about {{convert|5-10|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter. Smaller varieties, called [[pork ball]]s, are used in soups. A [[Cantonese cuisine|Cantonese]] variant, the [[steamed meatball]], is made of beef and served as a [[dim sum]] dish. [[Pearl meatballs]] are made of pork coated with [[glutinous rice]]. Fish and seafood can also used to create different flavors and textures, and vegetarian alternatives to meatballs are served during festivals. In northern China, meatballs made from minced meat and flour, sometimes with the addition of [[lotus root]] or [[water chestnut]] for texture, are deep-fried and served in a [[vinegar]]-based sweet and sour sauce, or in a light broth with chopped [[coriander]].

*[[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesian]] meatballs are called ''[[bakso]]'' which are usually served in a bowl, served in broth soup, with noodles, rice vermicelli, bean curd (tofu), hard-boiled egg, ''siomay'' steamed meat dumpling, and fried wonton. They have a consistent homogeneous texture. ''Bakso'' can be found in major Indonesian cities and towns; however, the most popular are ''bakso Solo'' and ''bakso Malang'' (named after the city of origin). In Malang, ''bakso bakar'' (roasted ''bakso'') is also popular. As most Indonesians are Muslim, generally it is made from beef or sometimes chicken.
*In [[Japanese cuisine]], a popular variant of meatballs is ''[[tsukune]]'', minced chicken meatballs on a skewer. Chinese-style meatballs are also popular.  Another kind of meatball called ''tsumire'' is made from ground fish.  This is often added to soups or nabes (stews).
*In the [[Filipino cuisine|Philippines]], meatballs are called ''bola-bola'' or ''almondigas'' and are usually served in a ''[[misua]]'' noodle soup with toasted garlic, squash and pork [[Pork rind|cracklings]]. ''Bola-bola'' are derived from Hispanic influence on Filipino cuisine and ultimately derived from Moorish influence. ''Bola-bola'' are also stewed or pan-fried until golden brown. ''Bola-bola'' is also used as a filling for [[siopao]], the local variant of ''[[baozi]]''.
*In [[Thai cuisine|Thailand]], meatballs (''luk chin'') are various. The materials can be pork, beef, chicken and fish. The finished meatballs can be incorporated into many dishes. They can be grilled, deep-fried, eaten with dipping sauce, or used as a component of noodle soups.
*In [[Vietnamese cuisine|Vietnam]], meatballs (''thịt viên'' or ''mọc'', ''bò viên'', ''cá viên'') can be used as an ingredient in ''[[phở]]'' and ''[[hủ tiếu]]''. It is also common to cook meatballs in tomato sauce, and finely chopped spring onion and peppers are added before serving. In ''[[bún chả]]'' (a specialty Vietnamese rice noodle), meatballs are grilled to be ''chả'' and served with ''bún'' (rice noodles) and dipping sauce (based on fish sauce seasoned with rice vinegar, sugar, garlic, and chili). ''Xíu nại'' is a pork meatball in a tomato sauce often served with a baguette.
