The '''Carniolan sausage''' ({{langx|sl|kranjska klobasa}}, {{langx|sh|kranjska kobasica}}, {{langx|en-AU|kransky}}, {{langx|de|Krainer Wurst}}, [[Italian dialect of Trieste]]: ''luganighe de Cragno'') is a [[Slovenia]]n [[Brühwurst|parboiled sausage]] similar to what is known as [[kielbasa]] or Polish sausage in North America.

The noun ''klobasa'' refers to a small sausage generally served whole (in contrast to ''salama'') in Slovene. The adjective ''kranjska'' derives from the region of [[Carniola]] (''Kranjska'' in Slovene, ''Krain'' in German), which used to be a duchy of the [[Austrian Empire]]. The earliest mention of the Carniolan sausage in German is found in [[Katharina Prato]]'s renowned cookbook ''Süddeutsche Küche'' (South German Cooking, 1896, first edition 1858). The Slovene term ''kranjska klobasa'' was first mentioned in the sixth edition of ''Slovenska kuharica'' (Slovene Cookbook) by [[Felicita Kalinšek]] in 1912.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Taste Slovenia |author=Bogataj Janez |year=2007 |publisher=Rokus Gifts |isbn=978-9-6165-3139-9}}</ref>

The Carniolan sausage contains at least 75 to 80% [[pork]] (aside from [[bacon]]) and at most 20% bacon. It may contain as much as 5% water, the [[sea salt]] from [[Sečovlje salt pans]], little [[garlic]], [[saltpetre]] and [[black pepper]]. No other ingredients are permitted. The meat must be cut in small pieces 10 to 13&nbsp;mm and bacon 8 to 10&nbsp;mm. The filling is stuffed into pork intestine with a diameter of 32 to 36&nbsp;mm. They are formed in pairs of {{convert|12|to|16|cm|abbr=on}} lengths and a weight of 180 to 220&nbsp;grams. Pairs are linked together with a wooden skewer. The sausages are hot smoked and heat-cured at about {{convert|70|C|F}}.

== Variations and preparation ==
[[File:Käsekrainer.jpg|thumb|Käsekrainer made in Austria]]
The ''[[Käsekrainer]]'' is a variation of this sausage made with small chunks of [[cheese]] – it contains 10% to 20% cheese (e.g., [[Emmental cheese| Emmentaler]]) cut into small cubes. ''Käsekrainer'' were first made in Austria in the early 1980s. {{As of|2019}} they are a standard offering at sausage stands ([[Würstelstand|Würstelstände]]). ''Käsekrainer'' can be boiled, baked or grilled. It is essential to keep them on low to medium heat; otherwise the outside may get burned and the inside remains cold. Care should be taken when preparing them, because the cheese can become quite hot; the sausages should not be cut or poked while cooking, otherwise the melting cheese would be released.

The sausage can be served with [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]], [[ketchup]] and a piece of dark [[bread]]; or – in the most common form in Austria – as a ''Käsekrainer-Hot-Dog''. (By ''Hot Dog'' Austrians mean the bun, not the sausage.) The bread used is somewhat similar to a French [[baguette]], but shorter ({{convert|200|to(-)|250|mm|abbr=on}} long) and has a different texture and recipe,  hence not called a baguette but a bun. The bun is cut open at one end and a hole is poked into it with a warm {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} metal rod. The next step is to put sauce in the hole. Austrians usually select from the following three sauces: sharp mustard, sweet mustard and ketchup.

== The (cheese) kransky in Australia ==
In the late 1940s and the 1950s, post-war immigrants from Yugoslavia introduced ''kranjska klobasa'' into Australia, where it became known as ''kransky''. Cheese kransky is very popular in Australia and in New Zealand.<ref>{{ cite web
