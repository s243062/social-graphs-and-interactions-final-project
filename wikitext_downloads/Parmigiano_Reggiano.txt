'''Parmesan''' ({{langx|it|Parmigiano Reggiano|italics=no}}, {{IPA|it|parmiˈdʒaːno redˈdʒaːno|pron}}) is an [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] [[Types of cheese#Hard cheese|hard]], [[Granular cheese|granular cheese]] produced from [[Dairy cattle|cow's milk]] and aged at least 12 months. It is a [[Grana (cheese)|grana]]-type cheese, along with [[Grana Padano]], the historic {{Ill|Granone Lodigiano|it}}, and others.

The term ''Parmesan'' may refer to either Parmigiano Reggiano or, when outside the [[European Union]] and [[Lisbon Agreement for the Protection of Appellations of Origin and their International Registration|Lisbon Agreement]] countries, a locally produced [[Parmesan#Non-European Parmesan cheese|imitation]].

'''Parmigiano Reggiano''' is named after two of the areas which produce it, the Italian provinces of [[Province of Parma|Parma]] and [[Province of Reggio Emilia|Reggio Emilia]] (''Parmigiano'' is the Italian adjective for the city and province of Parma and ''Reggiano'' is the adjective for the province of Reggio Emilia); it is also produced in the part of [[Province of Bologna|Bologna]] west of the [[Reno (river)|River Reno]] and in [[Province of Modena|Modena]] (all of the above being located in the [[Emilia-Romagna]] region), as well as in the part of [[Province of Mantua|Mantua]] ([[Lombardy]]) on the south bank of the [[Po (river)|River Po]].

The name ''Parmigiano'' is legally protected in the European Union and, in Italy, exclusive control is exercised over the cheese's production and sale by The Consortium of Parmigiano Reggiano, which was created by a governmental decree. Each wheel must meet strict criteria early in the aging process, when the cheese is still soft and creamy, to merit the official seal and be placed in storage for aging.

Because it is widely imitated, Parmigiano Reggiano has become an increasingly regulated product, and in 1955 it became what is known as a certified name (which is not the same as a [[Brand|brand name]]). In 2008, an EU court determined that the name ''Parmesan'' in Europe only refers to Parmigiano Reggiano and cannot be used for imitation Parmesan.<ref>Marsha A. Echols Geographical Indications for Food Products – 2008 Page 190 – "A defence was that the name 'Parmesan' has become generic and so cannot be a protected designation of origin. The Court disagreed.

==Name==
The English name ''parmesan'' is borrowed from French ''parmesan'', earlier ''parmisan'', in turn borrowed from Italian ''parmigiano''. In French, it is first attested as a name for the cheese in 1414, and in English, in 1519.<ref>{{Cite OED|term=parmesan|id=4470914647|access-date=24 August 2025}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Parmesan |url=http://stella.atilf.fr/Dictionnaires/TLFi/Rechercher/index.php?mot=parmesan |access-date=24 August 2025 |website=Trésor de la langue française informatisé (TLFi)}}</ref> The regular English pronunciation is {{nowrap|{{IPA|[ˈpɑː(ɹ).məˌzɑːn]}}}} but in US English it is often pronounced as the "[[Hyperforeignism|hyper-French]]" {{nowrap|[ˈpɑː(ɹ).məˌʒɑːn]}}, using the French sound /ʒ/ (not used in this word in French) to represent the Italian sound /dʒ/.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Language Log » How to pronounce "parmesan" |url=https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=19115 |access-date=2025-08-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Joseph |first=Brian D. |date=1994-01-01 |title=Systematic Hyperforeignisms As Maximally External Evidence for Linguistic Rules |url=https://www.academia.edu/425947/Systematic_Hyperforeignisms_As_Maximally_External_Evidence_for_Linguistic_Rules |journal=The reality of linguistic rules |pages=80}}</ref>

==Industry==
All producers of Parmigiano Reggiano belong to the {{lang|it|Consorzio del Formaggio Parmigiano Reggiano}} ({{literally|Parmigiano Reggiano Cheese Consortium}}), which was founded in 1928.<ref>Consorzio del Formaggio Parmigiano Reggiano, "The Consortium and its History"[https://www.parmigianoreggiano.com/consortium/consortium_history/default.aspx]</ref> Besides setting and enforcing the standards for the [[Protected designation of origin|PDO]], the ''Consorzio'' also sponsors marketing activities.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.parmigianoreggiano.com/consortium/consortium_history/default.aspx |work=Consorzio del Formaggio Parmigiano Reggiano |title=2018 Export Projects |date=2 August 2024 }}</ref>

{{asof|2017}}, about 3.6 million wheels (approx. 137,000 [[Tonne|metric tons]]) of Parmesan are produced every year; they use about 18% of all the milk produced in Italy.<ref>CLAL (Italian dairy consulting company), "Italy: Parmigiano Reggiano Cheese Production" [https://www.clal.it/en/?section=produzioni_parmigiano]</ref>

Most workers in the Italian dairy industry (''bergamini'') belong to the [[Italian General Confederation of Labour]]. As older dairy workers retire, younger Italians have tended to work in factories or offices. Immigrants have filled that role. In 2015, 60 percent of the workers in the Parmesan industry were [[Indians in Italy|immigrants from India]], almost all [[Sikhs]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mitzman|first1=Dany|title=The Sikhs who saved Parmesan|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-33149580|access-date=5 February 2018|work=BBC News|date=25 June 2015}}</ref>

Parmigiano Reggiano is made from unpasteurised [[Dairy cattle|cow's milk]]. The whole milk of the morning milking is mixed with the naturally skimmed milk of the previous evening's milking, resulting in a part skim mixture. This mixture is pumped into copper-lined vats, which heat evenly and contribute copper ions to the mix.<ref>{{cite web |first=Molly |last=McDonough |title=Why Copper Vats Matter |work=Culture: The Word on Cheese |url=https://culturecheesemag.com/cheese-iq/copper-vats-cheesemaking |date=July 19, 2017 }}</ref>

Starter [[whey]] (containing a mixture of certain [[thermophile|thermophilic]] [[lactic acid bacteria]]) is added, and the temperature is raised to {{convert|33|-|35|C}}. Calf [[rennet]] is added, and the mixture is left to curdle for 10–12 minutes. The curd is then broken up mechanically into small pieces (around the size of rice grains). The temperature is then raised to {{convert|55|C}} with careful control by the cheese-maker. The curd is left to settle for 45–60 minutes. The compacted curd is collected in a piece of [[muslin]] before being divided in two and placed in molds. There are {{convert|1100|L|usgal}} of milk per vat, producing two cheeses each. The curd making up each [[Truckle|wheel]] at this point weighs around {{convert|45|kg}}. The remaining whey in the vat was traditionally used to feed the pigs from which ''prosciutto di Parma'' was produced. The barns for these animals were usually just a few metres away from the cheese production rooms.{{Citation needed|date=May 2025}}

The cheese is put into a stainless steel, round form that is pulled tight with a spring-powered buckle so the cheese retains its wheel shape. After a day or two, the buckle is released and a plastic belt imprinted numerous times with the Parmigiano Reggiano name, the plant's number, and month and year of production is put around the cheese, and the metal form is buckled tight again. The imprints take hold on the rind of the cheese in about a day and the wheel is then put into a brine bath to absorb salt for 20–25 days. After brining, the wheels are then transferred to the aging rooms in the plant for 12 months. Each cheese is placed on wooden shelves that can be 24 cheeses high by 90 cheeses long or 2,160 total wheels per aisle. Each cheese and the shelf underneath it is then cleaned every seven days, and the cheese is turned.{{Citation needed|date=May 2025}}

At 12 months, the {{lang|it|Consorzio del Formaggio Parmigiano Reggiano}} ({{literally|Parmigiano Reggiano Cheese Consortium}}) inspects every wheel. The cheese is tested by one of the country's 25 master graders, known as {{lang|it|battitore}} ({{literally|batter}}), who taps each wheel with a small hammer (informally called {{lang|it|martelletto}}) to identify undesirable cracks and voids within the wheel, a process that takes about six or seven seconds.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2015-10-20 |title=Parmigiano Reggiano: 6 seconds to make a Dop - Cucine d'Italia |url=https://cucineditalia.com/en/parmigiano-reggiano-6-seconds-to-make-a-dop/ |access-date=2025-04-12 |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Danter |first=Jennifer |date=2017-07-24 |title=This is the best Italian cheese out there {{!}} Canadian Living |url=https://www.canadianliving.com/food/food-tips/article/this-is-the-best-italian-cheese-out-there |access-date=2025-04-12 |website=www.canadianliving.com}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fRnGDQAAQBAJ |title=The Oxford Companion to Cheese |date=2016-10-25 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-933089-8 |pages=148-150, 187-190, 539-541 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Italpress |first=Agenzia di Stampa |date=2024-12-02 |title=Parmigiano Reggiano, battitura al via per controllare la qualità Agenzia di stampa Italpress |url=https://www.italpress.com/parmigiano-reggiano-battitura-al-via-per-controllare-la-qualita/ |access-date=2025-04-12 |website=Italpress |language=it-IT}}</ref> There are three grading categories.<ref name=":1" /> Wheels in the top category are heat-branded on the rind with the {{lang|it|Consorzio}}'s logo.

According to legend, Parmigiano Reggiano was created in the course of the [[Middle Ages]] in the ''[[comune]]'' (municipality) of [[Bibbiano]], in the [[province of Reggio Emilia]]. Its production soon spread to the [[Parma]] and [[Modena]] areas. Historical documents show that in the 13th and 14th centuries, Parmigiano Reggiano was already very similar to that produced today, which suggests its origins can be traced to far earlier. Some evidence suggests that the name was used in Italy and France in the 17th-19th century.<ref name=":0" /> The earliest written record of this cheese is from the year 1254.<ref name=Zannoni15/>

It was praised as early as 1348 in the writings of [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]; in the ''[[The Decameron|Decameron]]'', he invents a "mountain, all of grated Parmesan cheese", on which "dwell folk that do nought else but make [[macaroni]] and [[ravioli]], and boil them in capon's broth, and then throw them down to be scrambled for; and hard by flows a rivulet of [[Vernaccia]], the best that ever was drunk, and never a drop of water therein".<ref>Giovanni Boccaccio, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yQMsAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA2-PA22 ''Decamerone'' VIII 3].

During the [[Great Fire of London]] of 1666, [[Samuel Pepys]] buried his "Parmazan cheese, as well as his wine and some other things" to preserve them.<ref>See Pepys's [http://www.pepys.info/1666/1666sep.html diary entry for 4 September, 1666] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515112509/http://www.pepys.info/1666/1666sep.html |date=2017-05-15 }}</ref>

In the memoirs of [[Giacomo Casanova]], he remarked that the name ''Parmesan'' was a misnomer common throughout an "ungrateful" Europe in his time (mid-18th century), as the cheese was produced in the ''[[comune]]'' (municipality) of [[Lodi, Lombardy|Lodi]], in Lombardy, not Parma.<ref>Casanova, ''Histoire de ma vie'' 8:ix.</ref>

The industrialization and subsequent standardization of Parmesan production in the 19th and 20th centuries have reduced the heterogeneity in its sensory characteristics, but the key characteristics: hardness, sharpness, aroma, saltiness, and savoriness have remained.<ref name=Zannoni10/><ref name=Zannoni15>{{cite conference |last1=Zannoni |first1=Mario |title=Changes in Production Practices, Trade, and Quality Assessment of Protected Designation of Origin Parmigiano-Reggiano Cheese From XIX To XXI Century |date=2015 |doi=10.22004/ag.econ.200230|conference=European Association of Agricultural Economists (EAAE) > 145th Seminar, April 14-15, 2015, Parma, Italy}}</ref>

Parmigiano Reggiano is also particularly high in [[Glutamic acid|glutamate]], containing as much as 1.2&nbsp;g of glutamate per 100&nbsp;g of cheese.

===Non-European production===
Parmesan cheese is defined differently in various jurisdictions outside of Europe.
* In the United States, the ''[[Code of Federal Regulations]]'' includes a [[Standards of identity for food|Standard of Identity]] for "Parmesan and Reggiano cheese".<ref name=CFR-133>{{citation | chapter-url = https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-133/subpart-B/section-133.165 | title = Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21 – Food and Drugs, Chapter I – Food and Drug Administration, Department of Health and Human Services (continued) (Parts 1–1299), Part 133 – Cheeses and related cheese products | chapter = §&nbsp;133.165: Parmesan and reggiano cheese | pages = 338–339 | date = April 1, 2006 | author = Food and Drug Administration, Department of Health and Human Services | author-link = Food and Drug Administration | publisher = [[United States Government Publishing Office]]}}</ref> This defines both aspects of the production process and of the final result. In particular, Parmesan must be made of cow's milk, cured for 10 months or more, contain no more than 32% water, and have no less than 32% [[milkfat]] in its solids.<ref name=CFR-133 />
* The Canadian regulation similarly includes moisture and fat levels, but has no restriction on aging time.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Legislative Services Branch |title=C.R.C., c. 870 B.08.033 (1) [S].

===Adulteration controversy===
Many American manufacturers have been investigated for allegedly going beyond the 4% cellulose limit (allowed as an [[anticaking agent]] for grated cheese, 21 CFR 133.146).<ref name="bloomberg" /> In one case, FDA findings found "no Parmesan cheese was used to manufacture" a Pennsylvania manufacturer's grated cheese labeled "Parmesan", apparently made from a mixture of other cheeses and cellulose.
