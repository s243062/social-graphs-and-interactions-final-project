'''{{lang|de|Currywurst}}''' ({{IPA|de|ˈkœʁiˌvʊɐ̯st|lang|De-Currywurst2.ogg}}<ref>Duden, [http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Curry Curry]. Accessed 2013-06-30</ref>) is a [[fast food]] dish [[German cuisine|of German origin]] consisting of [[sausage]] (usually pork) with [[curry ketchup]]. It was invented in 1949 by [[Herta Heuwer]], who began selling it at a food stand in West Berlin. The [[Deutsches Currywurst Museum]] estimated that 800 million currywursts are eaten every year in Germany, with 70 million in Berlin alone.

==History==

The invention of currywurst is attributed to [[Herta Heuwer]] in [[Berlin]] in 1949, after she obtained ketchup, or possibly [[Worcestershire sauce]], and [[curry powder]] from [[British Forces Germany|British soldiers in Germany]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Slackman|first=Michael|date=26 January 2011|title=A Favorite Dish Laden With Fat and Contradiction|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/27/world/europe/27berlin.html|access-date=24 October 2020}}</ref> She mixed these ingredients with other spices and poured them over grilled pork sausage. Heuwer started selling them at a stand in [[Charlottenburg]], where it became popular with construction workers rebuilding the devastated city.<ref name="Ind"/>

Heuwer patented her sauce under the name Chillup in 1951.<ref name="Ind">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/spicy-sausage-that-is-worthy-of-a-shrine-in-berlin-1772530.html|title=Spicy sausage that is worthy of a shrine in Berlin|work=The Independent|date=2009-08-15 | location=London | first=Tony | last=Paterson | access-date=2010-04-30}}</ref> At its height the stand was selling 10,000 servings per week.<ref name="DW20090815">{{cite news|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4573436,00.html|title=Honoring the best of the Wurst of German Cuisine |publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=2009-08-15}}</ref> She later opened a small restaurant which operated until 1974.<ref name="WSJ">{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204884404574364600782551292?mod=googlenews_wsj|title=The Craze Over Currywurst|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=2009-08-27 | first=Roman | last=Kessler}}</ref>

Today, {{lang|de|currywurst}} is often sold as a [[Take-out|take-away food]], Schnellimbisse (snack stands), at [[diner]]s or "[[greasy spoon]]s," on children's menus in [[restaurant]]s, or as a [[street food]] and usually served with chips or [[bread roll]]s (Brötchen). It is popular all over Germany but especially in the metropolitan areas of Berlin, [[Hamburg]] and the [[Ruhr Area]]. Considerable variation, both in the type of sausage used and the ingredients of the sauce, occurs between these areas.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/berlin-24-7-whats-the-currywurst-cult-all-about/a-40294501|title=Berlin 24/7: What's the currywurst cult all about? &#124; DW &#124; 03.09.2017|website=DW.COM}}</ref>

Common variations include the addition of [[paprika]] or chopped onions. [[Halal]] and [[kosher]] food stands often prepare currywurst with beef sausage.<ref name="auto"/> Often currywurst is sold in [[food booth]]s, sometimes using a special machine to slice it into pieces, and served on a paper plate with a little wooden or plastic fork, mostly a [[currywurst fork]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2014-11-12/chef-pierre-gagnaire-food-lover-s-guide-to-berlin|title=A Food Lover's Guide to Berlin|date = 12 November 2014|access-date=9 January 2015|publisher=Condé Nast}}</ref> It is sold as a [[supermarket]]-shelf product to prepare at home.<ref>{{cite web |title=So funktioniert der Trick bei Currywurst aus der Mikrowelle |url=https://www.stern.de/genuss/essen/currywurst-aus-der-mikrowelle--das-sind-die-tricks-der-industrie-30886174.html |website=[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]] |access-date=2 November 2025}}</ref>

The 1993 novel ''[[The Invention of Curried Sausage|Die Entdeckung der Currywurst]]'' (English title: "The Invention of Curried Sausage", {{ISBN|978-0811212977}}) by [[Uwe Timm]] was made into a 1998 play and a 2008 film both of the same name. The plot is based on an alternative but unproven theory that currywurst was invented in [[Hamburg]].

The [[Deutsches Currywurst Museum]] opened in Berlin in August 2009, commemorating the 60th anniversary of its creation.<ref name="DW20090815">{{cite news|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4573436,00.html|title=Honoring the best of the Wurst of German Cuisine |publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=2009-08-15}}</ref><ref name="Museum"/> Curator Martin Loewer said "No other national German dish inspires so much history and has so many well-known fans".<ref name="Reuters">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSTRE57C46Q20090813|title=German cult sausage gets own museum|publisher=Reuters|date=2009-08-13}}</ref> The museum received approximately 350,000 visitors annually.

In 2019 [[Staatliche Münze Berlin|Berlin State Mint]] issued a commemorative currywurst coin celebrating the 70 years since the savoury snack was first sold in Berlin by Herta Heuwer. The silver alloy coin features two currywursts pierced with a wooden chip fork and poured with the sauce (coloured by print), and [[Herta Heuwer]] in the background (caption: 70 Jahre Currywurst).
