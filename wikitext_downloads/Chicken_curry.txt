===Indian subcontinent===
Indian cuisine has a large amount of regional variation, with many variations on the basic chicken curry recipe. Indian chicken curry typically starts with whole spices, heated in oil. A sauce is then made with onions, ginger, garlic, and tomatoes, and powdered spices. Bone-in pieces of chicken are then added to the sauce, and simmered until cooked through.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRovp9c9e-4  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211215/NRovp9c9e-4 |archive-date=2021-12-15 |url-status=live|title=Quick and Easy Chicken Curry |author=Sanjeev Kapoor's Khazana |website=[[YouTube]] |date=16 January 2013 |access-date=10 May 2013}}{{cbignore}}</ref> In south India, [[coconut]] and [[curry leaves]] are also common ingredients.<ref>{{cite web |author=শিশির আহমেদ |title=Easy Chicken Curry |url=https://www.sheershanews24.com/indian-food/easy-chicken-curry-recipes-for-dinner-with-few-ingredients-2024/233/ |access-date=10 May 2013}}</ref> Chicken curry is usually garnished with coriander leaves, and served with rice or [[roti]].

===Caribbean===
This dish was introduced to the [[Indian people|Indians]] by [[Indian indenture system|indentured]] Indian workers. At that time, the dish was very similar to the chicken curry dish of [[India]], consisting mostly of sauce with few chicken pieces.{{cn|date=September 2023}} However, poultry in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] was so readily available that the dish began consisting of mainly chicken, flavored with curry spices. Typical preparation includes seasoning and marinating the chicken meat in a green seasoning consisting of [[Eryngium foetidum|culantro]], coriander, [[Coleus amboinicus|French thyme]], [[thyme]], [[scallion]], onion, garlic, and peppers. Then the curry is prepared by first adding oil to the pot and then adding and cooking curry powder mixed with water, then the chicken.<ref>{{cite book |date=2002 |title=The Multi-Cultural Cuisine of Trinidad & Tobago.

In Southeast Asia, where [[coconut]]s, and different spices originated, various native dishes made with coconut milk or [[curry paste]]s and eaten with rice are often collectively referred to as "curries" in English.<ref name="Van Esterik">{{cite book |last1=Van Esterik |first1=Penny |title=Food Culture in Southeast Asia |date=2008 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9780313344206 |pages=58–59}}</ref> Examples of these include Thai ''[[gaeng|gaeng gai]]'', Cambodian ''kari sach moan'' ({{langx|km|សាច់មាន់}}) and Filipino ''[[ginataang manok]]''. Chicken curries feature prominently in the repertoire of [[Burmese curry|Burmese curries]] and in Burmese ''[[ohn no khao swè]]'', a noodle soup of coconut milk and curried chicken.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|last1=Marks|first1=Copeland|url=|title=The Burmese Kitchen: Recipes from the Golden Land|last2=Thein|first2=Aung|date=1994-09-08|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-1-59077-260-7|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite book|last=Aye|first=MiMi|url=|title=Mandalay: Recipes and Tales from a Burmese Kitchen|date=2019-06-13|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4729-5948-5|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref>

However, derivatives of Indian chicken curry may be distinguished because they are relatively modern and are made with curry powder, [[curry tree]] leaves, or other Indian spices, like the [[Filipino chicken curry]] and the Malaysian chicken curry, although they still use ingredients native to Southeast Asia.<ref>{{cite web |title=Filipino Style Chicken Curry |url=https://www.nyonyacooking.com/recipes/malaysian-curry-chicken~H1WxdDjvz9-m |website=Panlasang Pinoy |date=25 April 2014 |access-date=16 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Malaysian Curry Chicken |url=https://panlasangpinoy.com/filipino-style-chicken-curry-knr-mm/ |website=Nyonya Cooking |date=4 November 2018 |access-date=16 November 2019}}</ref>

[[Country Captain|Country captain chicken]] is a stewed chicken dish flavored with curry powder, popular in parts of the Southern [[United States]]. The ''[[Hobson-Jobson]] Dictionary'' states the following:

{{quote|COUNTRY-CAPTAIN. This is in [[Bengal]] the name of a peculiar dry kind of curry, often served as a breakfast dish. We can only conjecture that it was a favourite dish at the table of the skippers of 'country ships,' who were themselves called 'country captains,' as in our first quotation. In [[Chennai|Madras]] the term is applied to a spatchcock dressed with onions and curry stuff, which is probably the original form. [Riddell says: "Country-captain.—Cut a fowl in pieces; shred an onion small and fry it brown in butter; sprinkle the fowl with fine salt and curry powder and fry it brown; then put it into a stewpan with a pint of soup; stew it slowly down to a half and serve it with rice" (Ind. Dom. Econ. 176).]

1792.—"But now, Sir, a Country Captain is not to be known from an ordinary man, or a [[Christians|Christian]], by any certain mark whatever." — ''Madras Courier'', April 26.

c. 1825.—"The local name for their business was the 'Country Trade,' the ships were 'Country Ships,' and the masters of them 'Country Captains.' Some of my readers may recall a dish which was often placed before us when dining on board these vessels at Whampoa, viz. 'Country Captain.'"—The Fankwae at Canton (1882), p. 33.<ref>The Hobson-Jobson Anglo-Indian dictionary: A glossary of colloquial Anglo-Indian words and phrases, and of kindred terms, etymological, historical, geographical and discursive.

In 1940, Mrs. W.L. Bullard from [[Warm Springs, Georgia]] served this dish under the name "Country Captain" to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[General]] [[George S. Patton]].<ref>{{cite book| last = Bunning Stevens
