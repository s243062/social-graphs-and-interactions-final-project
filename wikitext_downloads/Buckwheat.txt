'''Buckwheat''' ('''''Fagopyrum esculentum''''') or '''common buckwheat'''<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Ya |last2=Nie |first2=Zihan |last3=Ma |first3=Tingjun |date=2022-02-24 |title=The Effects of Plasma-Activated Water Treatment on the Growth of Tartary Buckwheat Sprouts |journal=Frontiers in Nutrition |volume=9 |article-number=849615 |doi=10.3389/fnut.2022.849615 |issn=2296-861X |pmc=8908094 |pmid=35284468|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name="USDA GRIN">{{cite web|url=https://npgsweb.ars-grin.gov/gringlobal/taxon/taxonomydetail?id=16528|title=USDA GRIN Taxonomy|access-date=16 December 2014}}</ref> is a [[flowering plant]] in the knotweed family [[Polygonaceae]] cultivated for its grain-like seeds and as a [[cover crop]]. Buckwheat cultivation originated around the 6th millennium BC in the region of what is now [[Yunnan|Yunnan Province]] in southwestern [[China]]. The name "buckwheat" is used for several other species, such as ''[[Fagopyrum tataricum]]'', a domesticated food plant raised in Asia.

Despite its name, buckwheat is not closely related to [[wheat]], nor is it a [[cereal]] or a member of the [[Poaceae|grass family]]. It is related to [[sorrel]], [[Polygonum|knotweed]], and [[rhubarb]]. Buckwheat is considered a [[pseudocereal]] because the high [[starch]] content of the seeds enables buckwheat to be cooked and consumed like a cereal.

== Etymology ==
The name "buckwheat" or "beech wheat" comes from its [[tetrahedral]] seeds, which resemble the much larger seeds of the beech nut from the [[beech|beech tree]], and the fact that it is used like wheat. The word may be a translation of [[Middle Dutch]] {{lang|dum|boecweite}}: {{lang|dum|boec}} "beech" (Modern Dutch {{lang|nl|beuk}}; see [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] *''bhago''-) and {{lang|dum|weite}} "wheat" (Mod. Dut. {{lang|nl|tarwe}}, antiquated {{lang|nl|weit}}), or may be a native formation on the same model as the Dutch word.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=buckwheat |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |access-date=2013-11-24}}</ref>

The wild ancestor of common buckwheat is ''F. esculentum'' ssp. ''ancestrale''. ''F. homotropicum'' is interfertile with ''F. esculentum'' and the wild forms have a common distribution, in Yunnan, a southwestern province of China. The wild ancestor of tartary buckwheat is ''F. tataricum'' ssp. ''potanini''.<ref>{{cite journal|author1= Ohnishi, O. |author2= Matsuoka, Y. |year= 1996|title= Search for the wild ancestor of buckwheat II.

Common buckwheat was domesticated and first cultivated in inland [[Southeast Asia]], possibly around 6000&nbsp;BC, and from there spread to [[Central Asia]] and [[Tibet]], and then to the [[Middle East]] and Europe, which it reached by the 15th century.<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Weekly| first1 = Ernest| publisher = Dover Publications |date = 1967| title = An Etymological Dictionary of Modern English|entry = Buckwheat|page = 211}}</ref> [[Domestication]] most likely took place in the western Yunnan region of China.<ref>{{cite journal

The oldest remains found in China so far date to {{circa}} 2600&nbsp;BC, while buckwheat pollen found in Japan dates from as early as 4000&nbsp;BC. It is the world's highest-elevation domesticate, being cultivated in [[Yunnan]] on the edge of the [[Tibetan Plateau]] or on the plateau itself. Buckwheat was one of the earliest crops introduced by Europeans to North America. Dispersal around the globe was complete by 2006, when a variety developed in Canada was widely planted in China. In India, buckwheat flour is known as ''kuttu ka atta'' and has long been culturally associated with many festivals like [[Shivratri]], [[Navaratri]] and  [[Janmashtami]]. On the day of these festivals, food items made only from buckwheat are consumed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bhaduri|first1=Niti Pathak|last2=Prajneshu|first2=Meenakshi|year=2016|title=Kuttu (Buckwheat): A Promising Staple Food Grain for Our Diet|url=http://jiid.in/2016/08/kuttu-buckwheat-promising-staple-food-grain-diet/|journal=Journal of Innovation for Inclusive Development|volume=1|pages=43–45|access-date=29 December 2016|archive-date=2018-10-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181018005420/http://jiid.in/2016/08/kuttu-buckwheat-promising-staple-food-grain-diet}}</ref>

== Cultivation ==
[[File:Rijpend Boekweit in Salland 2013.jpg| thumb|Buckwheat with flowers, ripe and unripe seeds]]

Buckwheat is a short-season crop that grows well in low-fertility or acidic soils; too much fertilizer – especially [[fertilizer#nitrogen fertilizer anchor|nitrogen]] – reduces yields, and  the soil must be well drained. In hot climates buckwheat can be grown only by sowing late in the season, so that it blooms in cooler weather. The presence of [[pollinator]]s greatly increases yield.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Płażek |first=Agnieszka |last2=Kopeć |first2=Przemysław |last3=Dziurka |first3=Michał |last4=Słomka |first4=Aneta |date=2023-09-25 |title=The yield of common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) depends on the genotype but not on the Pin-to-Thrum ratio |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-43059-0 |journal=Scientific Reports |language=en |volume=13 |issue=1 |page=16022 |doi=10.1038/s41598-023-43059-0 |issn=2045-2322|pmc=10519966 }}</ref> Nectar from flowering buckwheat produces a dark-colored honey.<ref>{{cite journal | first1 = Federica | last1 = Pasini | first2 = Silvia | last2 = Gardini | first3 = Gian Luigi | last3 = Marcazzan | first4 = Maria Fiorenza | last4 = Caboni | year = 2013 | title = Buckwheat honeys: Screening of composition and properties | journal = Food Chemistry | volume = 141 | issue = 3 | pages = 2802–2811 | doi = 10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.05.102 | pmid = 23871027 }}</ref>

Buckwheat is raised for grain where only a brief time is available for growth, either because the buckwheat is an early or a second crop in the season, or because the total growing season is limited. It establishes quickly, which suppresses summer weeds, and can be a reliable [[cover crop]] in summer to fit a small slot of warm season.<ref name="Björkman-2008"/> Buckwheat has a growing period of only 10–12 weeks<ref>{{cite report |collaboration=Agriculture Canada |year=1978 |title=Growing Buckwheat |place=Ottawa, Canada |publisher=[[Canadian Department of Agriculture]]}}</ref> and it can be grown in high latitude or northern areas.<ref>{{cite report |last1=Quisenberry |first1=K.S. |last2=Taylor |first2=J.W. |year=1939 |title=Growing Buckwheat |series=Farmers' bulletin |volume=1835 |pages=1–17 |place=Washington, DC |publisher=[[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]}}</ref> Buckwheat is sometimes used as a [[green manure]], as a plant for [[erosion]] control or as wildlife cover and feed.<ref name="Björkman-2008"/>

The fruit is an [[achene]], similar to [[sunflower seed]], with a single seed inside a hard outer [[Hull (botany)|hull]]. The starchy [[endosperm]] is white and makes up most or all of buckwheat [[flour]]. The seed coat is green or tan, which darkens buckwheat flour. The hull is dark brown or black, and some may be included in buckwheat flour as dark specks. The dark flour is known as ''blé noir'' (black wheat) in French, along with the name ''sarrasin'' ([[saracen]]). Similarly, in Italy, it is known as ''grano saraceno'' (saracen grain).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Grano Saraceno|url=https://www.deliciousitaly.com/lombardia-food-wine/grano-saraceno}}</ref> The grain can be prepared by simple dehulling, milling into [[farina (food)|farina]], to whole-grain flour or to white flour. The grain can be fractionated into starch, germ and hull for specialized uses.

Buckwheat [[groats]] are commonly used in western Asia and eastern Europe. The [[porridge]] was common, and is often considered the definitive [[peasant]] dish. It is made from [[roast]]ed groats that are cooked with [[broth]] to a texture similar to rice or [[bulgur]]. The dish was taken to America by Jewish, Ukrainian, Russian, and [[Polish people|Polish]] immigrants who called it ''[[kasha]]'', as it is known today, who mixed it with [[pasta]] or used it as a filling for [[cabbage rolls]] (stuffed cabbage), [[knish]]es, and [[blintz]]es. Groats were the most widely used form of buckwheat worldwide during the 20th century, eaten primarily in [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], Russia, [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], and Poland, called ''grechka'' ('Greek grain') in Belarusian, Ukrainian, and Russian languages.

Buckwheat [[noodle]]s have been eaten in [[Tibet]] and northern China for centuries, where the growing season is too short to raise wheat. A wooden press is used to press the [[dough]] into hot boiling water when making buckwheat noodles. Old presses found in Tibet and [[Shanxi]] share the same basic design features. The Japanese and Koreans may have learned the process of making buckwheat noodles from them.{{Citation needed|date=August 2025}}

Local buckwheat variety from [[Bongpyeong-myeon|Bongpyeong]], Korea, is known as ''Bongpyeong memil'' and is a powerful symbol for both cultural and gastronomic reasons.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bongpyeong Buckwheat |url=https://www.fondazioneslowfood.com/en/ark-of-taste-slow-food/bongpyeong-buckwheat/ |website=[[Ark of taste]] |publisher=[[Slow Food Foundation]] |access-date=2025-08-12}}</ref> 

Noodles also appear in Italy, with ''pasta di grano saraceno'' in [[Apulia]] region of Southern Italy and ''[[pizzoccheri]]'' in the [[Valtellina]] region of Northern Italy.

Buckwheat [[pancake]]s are eaten in several countries. They are known as buckwheat ''[[blini]]'' in Russia, ''[[kaletez|galettes bretonnes]]'' in France, ''[[ploye]]s'' in [[Acadia]], ''[[poffertjes]]'' in the Netherlands, ''boûketes'' in the [[Wallonia]] region of Belgium, ''kuttu ki puri'' in India and ''kachhyamba'' in Nepal. Similar pancakes were a common food in American pioneer days.<ref name="Oliver-2005">{{cite book|author=Sandra Louise Oliver|title=Food in Colonial and Federal America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fvMr83ZmMCIC&pg=PA164|date=1 January 2005|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|isbn=978-0-313-32988-3|page=164}}</ref> They are light and airy when baked. The buckwheat flour gives the pancakes an earthy, mildly mushroom-like taste.

Yeasted patties called ''hrechanyky'' are made in Ukraine.

Buckwheat is a permitted sustenance during fasting in several traditions. In India, on [[Hindu]] fasting days ([[Navaratri]], [[Ekadashi]], [[Krishna Janmashtami|Janmashtami]], [[Maha Shivaratri]], etc.), fasting people in northern states of India eat foods made of buckwheat flour. Eating cereals such as [[wheat]] or [[rice]] is prohibited during such fasting days.  While strict Hindus do not even drink water during their fast, others give up cereals and salt and instead eat non-cereal foods such as buckwheat (''kuttu''). In the Russian Orthodox tradition, it is eaten on the St. Philip fast.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://orthochristian.com/125909.html |title = What to Eat During the Fast|website=Orthodox Christianity.com|access-date=1 October 2021}}</ref>

[[Buckwheat honey]] is dark, strong and aromatic. Because it does not complement other honeys,  it is normally produced as a [[monofloral honey]].

=== Beer ===
In recent years, buckwheat has been used as a substitute for other grains in [[gluten-free beer]]. Although it is not an actual cereal (being a pseudocereal), buckwheat can be used in the same way as [[barley]] to produce a [[malt]] that can form the basis of a [[mashing|mash]] that will brew a [[beer]] without [[gliadin]] or [[hordein]] (together [[gluten]]) and therefore can be suitable for [[coeliac disease|coeliacs]] or others sensitive to certain [[glycoproteins]].<ref>{{cite web

== Upholstery filling ==
[[File:Buckwheat hulls.jpg|thumb|right|Buckwheat hulls]]
Buckwheat hulls are used as filling for a variety of [[upholstery|upholstered]] goods, including [[pillow]]s. The hulls are durable and do not insulate or reflect heat as much as synthetic filling. They are sometimes marketed as an alternative natural filling to feathers for those with allergies. However, medical studies to measure the health effects of pillows manufactured with ''unprocessed'' and ''uncleaned'' hulls concluded that such buckwheat pillows do contain higher levels of a potential allergen that may trigger [[asthma]] in susceptible individuals than do new synthetic-filled pillows.<ref>{{cite journal
