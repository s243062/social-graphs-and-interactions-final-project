'''Pelmeni''' ({{langx|ru|пельмени}}, ''[[Romanization of Russian|pel’meni]]'', {{IPA|ru|pʲɪlʲˈmʲenʲɪ|pron}}; {{singular}} '''pelmen''', {{langx|ru|пельмень|label=none}}, ''[[Romanization of Russian|pel’men’]]'', {{IPA|ru|pʲɪlʲˈmʲenʲ|pron}}) are [[dumpling]]s of [[Russian cuisine]] that consist of a filling wrapped in thin, unleavened [[dough]]. They are considered to be a [[national dish]].{{sfn|Gallani|2015|p=21}}

Pelmeni became a staple of Russian cuisine during the period of Russian expansion into the [[Ural Mountains]] and [[Siberia]].{{sfn|Goldstein|2022|p=27|loc="From this union came various types of boiled dumplings, such as ''manty'' stuffed with ground lamb and the beloved Siberian ''pel’meni''..."}} Pelmeni also have deep roots in the traditions and folklore of the [[Komi Republic|Komi]] and [[Udmurtia]] regions of Russia and figure prominently in [[Komi]] and [[Udmurt cuisine]] .<ref name="Fennougria">{{Cite web |title=International Pelmen Day Celebrated in Udmurtia |url=https://fennougria.ee/en/international-pelmen-day-celebrated-in-udmurtia/ |publisher=Fennougria |language=en |quote=Udmurtia is the homeland of the pelmeni dumplings.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Коми-Пермяцкое мясо-тестяное блюдо эпохи складывания Всероссийского рынка, или антропология пельменя |url=https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/komi-permyatskoe-myaso-testyanoe-blyudo-epohi-skladyvaniya-vserossiyskogo-rynka-ili-antropologiya-pelmenya?ysclid=m5jitwxzf8207610583}}</ref>  The name itself was borrowed from the language of the [[Komi]] and [[Udmurt|Udmurt folks]].{{sfn|Goldstein|2022|p=27}}<ref>{{Cite web |title=Pelmeni – Siberian Meat Dumplings |url=https://foodperestroika.com/2017/06/24/pelmeni-siberian-meat-dumplings/ |publisher=Food Perestroika |language=en |quote=The word “pelmeni” is derived from “pelnyan,” which literally means “ear bread” in the Finno-Ugric Komi and Udmurt languages.}}</ref>

[[File:Modeling pelmeni. Buryatia, Russia.jpg|thumb|Modeling pelmeni. [[Buryatia]], [[Russia]]]]
The dough is made from [[flour]] and [[water]], sometimes adding a small portion of [[Egg (food)|eggs]].<ref>[http://www.gotovim.ru/recepts/sbs/pelmeny.shtml Step-by-step instructions for preparation of pelmeni], with photographs {{in lang|ru}}</ref>

Pelmeni can be served in several ways; for example, they can be cooked in stock, or they can be cooked ''[[consommé]]'' and served in a bowl with soup.{{sfn|Volokh|Manus|1989|p=188}} Pelmeni can be served as a main dish for lunch or dinner, either smothered in butter or prepared Siberian-style, which involves sprinkling them with vinegar and adding freshly ground pepper for extra flavor.{{sfn|Volokh|Manus|1989|p=188}}

The filling can be [[Ground meat|minced meat]] ([[pork]], [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[beef]], [[Fish as food|fish]] or any other kind of meat, [[venison]] being particularly traditional for colder regions) or [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]], or a combination of the two. The mixing together of different kinds of meat is also popular. In [[European Russia]],  ground beef is used and mushroom-filled pelmeni are also accepted.{{sfn|Volokh|Manus|1989|p=188}} The traditional [[Udmurtia|Udmurt]] recipe requires a mixture of 45% beef, 35% [[Lamb and mutton|mutton]], and 20% pork.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pelemeni.ru/ural.html|title=Уральские пельмени. Рецепт уральских пельменей. Пельмени.|website=www.pelemeni.ru}}</ref> Various spices, such as black pepper and diced onions as well as garlic, are mixed into the filling. They are commonly topped with [[sour cream]], [[mayonnaise]], [[dill]], [[red onions]] or [[vinegar]], all of which are traditional to the region and can be produced in the Siberian climate.

Adding small amounts of [[cabbage]], [[tomato]] and [[horseradish]] into the mince is also common for certain regional recipes.

Temperature and humidity have considerable impact on dough consistency and stability.

Pelmeni belong to the family of [[dumpling]]s, and resemble the [[Ukrainian cuisine|Ukrainian]] and [[Polish cuisine|Polish]] ''[[uszka]]''.

In the United States and Canada, the term ''[[perogi|pierogi]]'' or ''perogies'' is often used to describe all kinds of Eastern European dumplings, regardless of the shape, size, or filling. Pelmeni are also similar to Mongolian ''[[bansh]]'', Chinese ''[[jiaozi]]'' (Cantonese ''gaau'') or Chinese ''húntún'' (Cantonese [[wonton]]). They are cousins to the [[Armenian cuisine|Armenian]], [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]] and [[Kazakh cuisine|Kazakh]] [[manti (dumpling)|''manti'']], the [[Georgian cuisine|Georgian]] ''[[khinkali]]'', the [[Nepalese cuisine|Nepalese]] and [[Tibetan cuisine|Tibetan]] [[momo (dumpling)|''momo'']], the Uyghur and [[Uzbek cuisine|Uzbek]] ''[[chuchvara]]'', the [[Korean cuisine|Korean]] ''[[mandu (food)|mandu]]'', the [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]] ''[[gyoza]]'', the [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] ''[[tortellini]]'' and ''[[ravioli]]'', and [[Swabia]]n ''[[Maultaschen]]''. Somewhat similar are the fried or baked ''[[empanadas]]'' encountered in Hispanic-influenced cultures.

The most important difference between pelmeni, ''varenyky'', and ''pierogi'' is the thickness of the dough shell—in pelmeni and vareniki this is as thin as possible, and the proportion of filling to dough is usually higher.<ref>[http://vidido.ua/index.php/poglyad/comments/pel_meniv_ne_bude_budut_ravioli/ 'Пельменів не буде — будуть равіолі?'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227153210/http://vidido.ua/index.php/poglyad/comments/pel_meniv_ne_bude_budut_ravioli/ |date=2008-12-27 }} {{in lang|uk}}</ref> Pelmeni are never served with a sweet filling, which distinguishes them from ''vareniki'' and Polish ''pierogi'', which sometimes are. Also, the fillings in pelmeni are usually raw, while the fillings of ''vareniki'' and ''pierogi'' are typically precooked.

The main difference between pelmeni and momos is their size—a typical pelmen is about {{convert|2|to(-)|3|cm|in|frac=4|spell=in}} in diameter, whereas momos are often at least twice that size.

===Regional differences===
[[Image:Пельмени жареные.jpg|thumb|Fried pelmeni]]
In Siberia, pelmeni are traditionally frozen outdoors in the winter and treated as [[preserved food]]. Hunters or explorers heading into the [[taiga]] would carry sacks of frozen pelmeni with their provisions since they can be stored frozen for a long time and are easily cooked.<ref name=siberia>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pelemeni.ru/siberian.html|title=Сибирские пельмени. История сибирских пельменей.|website=www.pelemeni.ru}}</ref>

Pelmeni are prepared immediately before eating by boiling in salted water until they float, and then two to five minutes more. In the [[Ural (region)|Urals]], they are boiled in plain water, while in Siberia they are boiled in salted water or sometimes meat or chicken [[broth]].<ref name="siberia" /> The cooked pelmeni are served alone or topped with melted [[butter]] or [[Smetana (dairy product)|smetana]] ([[sour cream]]), as well as condiments like [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]], [[horseradish]], [[ketchup|tomato sauce]], and [[vinegar]]. In the [[Russian Far East]], they generally add [[soy sauce]].

There are many traditional recipes, some of them suggest frying pelmeni after boiling until they turn golden brown. Pelmeni can also be served in a clear soup,<ref name="sras">{{Cite web |url=https://folkways.today/pelmeni-tasty-history |title=Pelmeni, A Tasty History – on Folkways.Today, Run by SRAS.org, formerly the School of Russian and Asian Studies, California |date=22 June 2020 |access-date=2024-04-27}}</ref> although in Siberia this is considered in poor taste and pelmeni are carefully strained before serving.<ref name="siberia" /> In [[Tatar cuisine]], ''pilmän'' (the [[Tatars|Tatar]] equivalent of pelmeni) are a traditional dish, where they have always been served with clear soup and added dill or other freshly cut herbs. Pelmeni are also part of [[Polish cuisine]].

Packed frozen, pelmeni can be found in ethnic Russian and Ukrainian food stores everywhere. Packets of frozen pelmeni, like those carried on the taiga, are usually labeled "Siberian pelmeni".<ref name="siberia" /> Store-bought pelmeni are made on industrial machinery, much of which is made by Italian companies such as Arienti and Cattaneo, Ima, [[Ostoni]], Zamboni, etc. These pelmeni usually weigh around {{convert|15|g|oz|frac=2}} each and look like a larger version of [[tortellini]], which is why, for industrial production, Italian pasta machines are commonly used. Pelmeni are also commonly made at home. The easiest (if somewhat laborious) way is simply to make them by hand; many cooks use specialized "pelmeni makers" ({{langx|ru|пельменница}}, ''pelmennitsa''), which are essentially molds that resemble muffin pans or ravioli molds, allowing one to quickly make a few dozen pelmeni out of two sheets of dough and a quantity of ground meat.

In Russia, store-bought pelmeni are considered a kind of [[convenience food]] associated with students' or bachelors' lifestyles, much like [[instant ramen]] in the West,{{sfn|Gallani|2015|p=67|loc="In Russia, shop-bought pelmeni are associated with the student or bachelor lifestyle..."}} while home-made pelmeni are considered hearty, healthy food.{{sfn|Volokh|Manus|1989|p=189}} Store-bought frozen pelmeni, including those catered for the Russian émigré community, are therefore only remotely related and fail to capture the qualities of the original dish.{{sfn|Volokh|Manus|1989|p=189}}

==History==
The word ''pelmeni'' is derived from ''pel'n'an{{'}}'' (пельнянь), literally "ear bread" in the Finno-Ugric [[Komi language|Komi]] and [[Udmurt language|Udmurt]] languages.<ref>{{Vasmer|пельмень}}</ref>{{sfn|Gallani|2015|p=21}} Alternatively, it is literally translated as "dough ears".{{sfn|Goldstein|2022|p=27|loc="Their name, literally 'dough ears,' comes from the language of the Komi-Permyak people who lived in that region"}}

The origins of pelmeni are contested, but they are widely viewed as a [[Siberia]]n contribution to Russian cuisine.{{sfn|Goldstein|2022|pp=27–28}}{{sfn|Volokh|Manus|1989|p=188}} One theory suggests pelmeni, or stuffed boiled dumplings in general, originated in Siberia, possibly a simplified adaptation of the Chinese [[jiaozi]] (in some dialects it is called Bāomiàn "包麵/包面").{{sfn|Gallani|2015|p=21}} This theory is corroborated by the fact that traditional pelmeni fillings are strongly flavored with black pepper and other spices that are not native to Russia.{{sfn|Gallani|2015|p=21}} Therefore, pelmeni may have been carried by the Mongols from China to Siberia and the [[Urals]].{{sfn|Gallani|2015|p=21}} Another theory is that they originated in the Urals and were then spread to [[Central Asia]] by Russian explorers and pioneers.{{sfn|Gallani|2015|p=21}} Pelmeni may have also been developed by hunters, who needed food that was light and easy to prepare in order to be able to take with them on hunting trips.{{sfn|Gallani|2015|p=21}}

Pelmeni began to appear in restaurants in late 19th-century France at a time when Russian dishes had already made a considerable impact on ''[[haute cuisine]]''.{{sfn|Volokh|Manus|1989|p=188}} [[Auguste Escoffier]] included them as a hot [[hors d'oeuvre]] in ''[[Le Guide Culinaire]]'', which was contrary to the Russian custom.{{sfn|Volokh|Manus|1989|p=188}}

==Culture==
Pelmeni hold an important place in Russian and [[Udmurt]] culture. In the capital of Udmurtia, the city of [[Izhevsk]],  a monument dedicated to pelmeni has been erected,<ref name="Fennougria"/> symbolizing the dish’s cultural significance. [[Udmurtia]] also celebrates an annual gastronomic festival called the World Pelmen Day,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Festival “International Pelmen Day”: National Pelmeni from All Over Russia in Udmurtia |url=https://visitudmurtia.org/news/festival-vsemirnyy-den-pelmenya-natsionalnye-pelmeni-so-vsey-rossii-v-udmurtii/#:~:text=11-й%20гастрономический%20фестиваль%20«Всемирный,Чувашская%20Республика%20другие%20регионы%20страны. |publisher=Visit Udmurtia |language=ru}}</ref><ref name="Fennougria"/> which brings together traditional pelmeni recipes from across Russia and highlights the dish’s importance to the region.
