'''Potato chips''' ([[North American English|North American]] and [[Australian English]]; often just '''chips''') or '''crisps''' ([[British English|British]] and [[Hiberno-English|Irish English]]) are thin slices of [[potato]] (or a thin deposit of potato paste<!-- like Pringles -->) that have been [[deep frying|deep-fried]], [[baking|baked]], or [[air frying|air-fried]] until crunchy. They are commonly served as a [[snack]], [[side dish]], or [[appetizer]]. The basic chips are cooked and [[Edible salt|salted]]; additional varieties are manufactured using various flavorings and ingredients including [[herbs]], [[spice]]s, [[cheese]]s, other natural flavors, [[artificial flavours|artificial flavors]], and [[Food additive|additives]].

Potato chips form a large part of the [[snack food]] and convenience food market in Western countries. The global potato chip market generated total revenue of US$16.49 billion in 2005. This accounted for 35.5% of the total savory snacks market in that year (which was $46.1 billion overall).<ref name="potatopro"/>

== History ==

The earliest known recipe for potato chips is in the English cook [[William Kitchiner]]'s book ''[[The Cook's Oracle (cookbook)|The Cook's Oracle]]'' published in 1817 in London,<ref name="Berry"/><ref name="newstimes"/><ref>{{cite book | last=Whittle | first=Natalie | title=Crunch: The History of Crisps | publisher=Faber & Faber | date=2024-10-08 | isbn=978-0-571-38412-9 | page=}}</ref> which was a bestseller in the United Kingdom and the United States.<ref>{{cite web | last=Magazine | first=Smithsonian | last2=Tensley | first2=Brandon | title=How the Potato Chip Took Over America | website=Smithsonian Magazine | date=6 January 2022 | url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/curious-history-potato-chip-180979232/ | access-date=14 February 2025}}</ref> The 1822 edition's recipe for "Potatoes fried in Slices or Shavings" reads "peel large potatoes... cut them in shavings round and round, as you would peel a lemon; dry them well in a clean cloth, and fry them in lard or dripping".<ref name="Berry"/><ref name="William Kitchiner"/> An 1825 British book about French cookery calls them "Pommes de Terre frites" (second recipe) and calls for thin slices of potato fried in "clarified butter or goose dripping", to be drained once crisp and sprinkled with salt.<ref name="Boys"/> Early recipes for potato chips in the US are found in [[Mary Randolph]]'s ''Virginia House-Wife'' (1824)<ref name="Randolph"/> and in N.K.M. Lee's ''Cook's Own Book'' (1832),<ref name="Lee"/> both of which explicitly cite Kitchiner.<ref name="McWilliams"/>

A legend associates the creation of potato chips with [[Saratoga Springs, New York]], decades later than the first recorded recipe.<ref name="booktmp-2013"/> By the late nineteenth century, a popular version of the story, today known to be untrue,<ref name="jstor">{{cite web | last=White | first=April | title=The Story of the Invention of the Potato Chip Is a Myth | website=JSTOR Daily | date=4 May 2017 | url=https://daily.jstor.org/story-invention-potato-chip-myth/ | access-date=1 July 2025}}</ref><ref name="newstimes">{{cite web | first=Wendy | last=Liberatore | title=Vanderbilt helped invent potato chip in Saratoga?

Frustrated, Crum sliced several potatoes extremely thin, fried them to a crisp, and seasoned them with extra salt – to his surprise, the customer loved them.<ref name="jstor"/> They soon came to be called "Saratoga Chips",<ref name="Civil War"/> a name that persisted into the mid-twentieth century. A version of this story was popularized in a 1973 national advertising campaign by St. Regis Paper Company which manufactured packaging for chips, claiming that Crum's customer was [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]].<ref name="fox"/> The story is today known to be a myth, and historians and academics have identified a number of problems with the story: Vanderbilt was in Europe during the alleged encounter, the Moons didn't purchase the Lake House until 1854, and crispy fried potatoes were not unknown to Saratoga in 1853.<ref name="jstor"/> However, the story remains frequently cited in popular media.<ref name="newstimes"/>

== Production ==
[[File:Production of homemade chips (4).JPG|thumb|Homemade potato slices are deep-fried in hot oil for several minutes.]]
In the 20th century, potato chips spread beyond chef-cooked restaurant fare and began to be mass-produced for home consumption.

=== Packaging ===

In the 1920s, [[Laura Scudder]],<ref name="Scudder's'" /><ref name="Hudson" /><ref name="La Ganga" /> an entrepreneur in [[Monterey Park, California]], started having her workers take home sheets of wax paper to iron into the form of bags, which were filled with chips at her factory the next day.

=== Kettle-cooked chips ===
{{redirect|Kettle chips|the brand|Kettle Foods}}

[[File:Cape Cod potato chips 2.jpg|thumb|right|Kettle-cooked chips]]

Chips were long made in a [[batch production|batch process]], where the potato slices are rinsed with cold water to release starch,<ref name="seriouseats"/> fried at a low temperature of {{convert|300|°F|-1}},<ref name="Roman"/> and continuously raked to prevent them from sticking together.

Industrial advances resulted in a shift to production by a [[Continuous production|continuous process]], running the chips through a vat of hot oil and drying them in a conveyor process.

Some small producers continued to use a batch process, notably in [[Maui]].<ref name="Hornblower"/> In 1980, inspired by the Maui Chip, an entrepreneur started [[Cape Cod Potato Chips]] to produce thicker, batch-cooked "Hawaiian style" potato chips, which came to be known as kettle-style (US) or hand-cooked (UK) chips and became a premium, "gourmet" item.<ref name="Cape Cod"/> Kettle chips are thicker and the surface starch is not rinsed off, resulting in a style of chip called "hard-bite".<ref name="Severson"/>

== Nomenclature ==
{{Original research|section|date=April 2021}}
[[File:Potato Chips Rezowan.jpg|thumb|left|A Bangladeshi version of potato chips, marketed as "potato crackers"]]

Little consistency exists in the [[English-speaking world]] for the name of this food. North American English uses "chips", though Canadians may also call French fries, especially thick ones, "chips" as well.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.campcanada.com.au/blog/from-eh-to-zamboni-11-phrases-you-need-to-know-before-summer-camp-in-canada | title=From "Eh" to "Zamboni": 11 Phrases You Need to Know Before Summer Camp in Canada }}{{Dead link|date=July 2025 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> "Crisps" may be used for thin fried or baked products made from potato paste.<ref name="pringles"/> An example of this type of snack is [[Pringles]], which are marketed as "potato crisps" even in the United States.<ref name="pringles" />

In the United Kingdom and Ireland they are called "crisps", whilst "chips" refers to [[french fries]] (as in "[[fish and chips]]").<ref name="Oxford"/> In Australia, some parts of South Africa, New Zealand, India, and the [[West Indies]], especially in Barbados, both forms of potato product are simply known as "chips", as are the larger "home-style" variety. In the north of New Zealand, they are sometimes affectionately known as "chippies"; however, they are marketed as "chips" throughout the country.{{cn|date=June 2023}} In Australia and New Zealand, a distinction is sometimes made between "hot chips" (fried potatoes) and "chips" or "potato chips". In Bangladesh, they are generally known as "chip" or "chips", and much less frequently as "crisps" (pronounced "kirisp") and locally, ''alu bhaja''.

In German-speaking countries (Austria, Germany: "''Kartoffelchips''", often shortened to "Chips"; Switzerland: "''Pommes Chips''") and in countries of the [[former Yugoslavia]], fried thin potato slices are known as "chips" (locally pronounced very similarly to the English pronunciation), with a clear distinction from French fries. In Brazil, "home-style" potato chips are known as {{lang|pt|batatas portuguesas}} ("Portuguese potatoes") if their sides are relatively smooth and {{lang|pt|batatas prussianas}} ("Prussian potatoes") if their sides show a wafer biscuit-like pattern, whilst American-like industrial uniform potato chips made from a fried potato purée-based dough are known as "batata chips" ("potato chips"), or just "chips".{{Citation needed|date=March 2022}}

== Health concerns ==

Most potato chips contain high levels of [[Sodium in biology|sodium]], from [[salt]]. This has been linked to health issues such as high [[blood pressure]].<ref name="Rothstein"/> However, researchers at [[Queen Mary University of London]] in 2004 have noted that a small "bag of ready-salted crisps" contains less salt than a serving of many breakfast cereals, including "every brand of [[cornflakes]] on sale in the UK".<ref name="QMU"/>

Some potato chip companies have responded to the long-standing concerns by investing in research and development to modify existing recipes and create health-conscious products. [[PepsiCo]] research shows that about 80% of salt on chips is not sensed by the tongue before being swallowed. [[Frito-Lay]] spent $414 million in 2009 on product development, including development of salt crystals that would reduce the salt content of [[Lay's]] potato chips without adversely affecting flavor.<ref name="newsalt"/>

Unsalted chips are available, e.g. the longstanding British brand [[Salt 'n' Shake]], whose chips are not seasoned but instead include a small salt [[sachet]] in the bag for seasoning to taste. Many other popular brands in the United States, such as [[Frito-Lay]], also offer such a product.

One [[health scare]] related to potato chips focused on [[acrylamide]], which is produced when potatoes are fried or baked at high temperatures. This discovery in 2002 led to international health concerns. Subsequent research has however found that it is not likely that the acrylamides in burnt or well-cooked food cause cancer in humans; [[Cancer Research UK]] categorizes the idea that burnt food causes cancer as a "myth".<ref name=cruk>{{cite web |url=https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/cancer-myths/can-eating-burnt-foods-cause-cancer |publisher=Cancer Research UK |title=Can eating burnt foods cause cancer? |date=15 October 2021 }}</ref>

In August 2008, [[California Attorney General]] [[Jerry Brown]] announced a settlement with [[Frito-Lay]], [[Kettle Foods]], and [[Lance Inc.]], the makers of [[Cape Cod Potato Chips]], for violating the state's [[California Proposition 65 (1986)|Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act]]. The state had alleged in 2005 that potato chips from these companies failed to document that they contained high levels of acrylamide, which is listed by California since the 1990s as a [[carcinogen]]. These companies paid fines and agreed to reduce acrylamide levels to be under 275 parts per billion.<ref name="Brown"/><ref name="Lazarus"/> Many potato chip manufacturers attempt to remove burned and thus potentially acrylamide-rich chips before the packaging process. Large scanners are used to eliminate chips worst affected by heat.<ref name="NHS"/>

In [[Germany]], [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], salted and [[Paprika|sweet paprika]] chips (sometimes also called ''ungarisch'' (from "[[Hungarian cuisine|Hungarian]]") in Germany) are the two most common and popular types.

[[File:Pringles chips.JPG|thumb|[[Pringles]] potato crisps are uniform in size and shape, which allows them to be stacked.]]

Another food made from potatoes, notably the [[Pringles]] and [[Lay's Stax]] brands, is made by [[Food extrusion|extruding]] or pressing a dough made from dehydrated potato flour into the desired shape before frying. This makes a product that is uniform in size and shape, which allows them to be stacked and packaged in rigid cardboard or plastic canisters. Pringles are officially branded as "potato crisps" in the US. Pringles may be termed "potato chips" in Britain, to distinguish them from traditional "crisps", but do not meet the definition or [[standard of identity]] for potato chips. [[Munchos]], another brand that uses the term "potato crisps", has deep air pockets in its chips that give it a curved shape, though the chips themselves resemble regular bagged chips.

An additional product similar to potato chips exists in the form of "potato sticks", also called "shoestring potatoes". These are made as extremely thin (2 to 3&nbsp;mm) versions of the popular French fry but are fried in the manner of regular salted potato chips. A [[hickory]]-smoke-flavored version is popular in Canada, going by the [[vending machine]] name "Hickory Sticks". Potato sticks are typically packaged in rigid containers, although some manufacturers use flexible pouches, similar to potato chip bags. Potato sticks were originally packed in hermetically sealed steel cans. In the 1960s, manufacturers switched to the less expensive composite canister (similar to the Pringles container). [[Reckitt Benckiser]] was a market leader in this category{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} under the Durkee Potato Stix and [[French's]] Potato Sticks names but exited the business in 2008. In 2014, French's reentered the market. A larger variant (about 1&nbsp;cm thick) made with dehydrated potatoes is marketed as [[Andy Capp]]'s [[Andy Capp's|Pub Fries]], using the theme of a long-running British [[comic strip]], which are baked and sold in a variety of flavors. Walkers make a similar product (using the Smiths brand) called "Chipsticks" which are sold in ready-salted and salt and vinegar flavors.

Some companies have also marketed baked potato chips as an alternative with lower fat content. Additionally, some varieties of fat-free chips have been made using artificial, and indigestible, fat substitutes.

Many other products might be called "crisps" in Britain, but would not be classed as "potato chips" because they are not made with potato or are not chipped (for example, [[Wotsits]], [[Quavers]], [[Skips (snack)|Skips]], [[Hula Hoops]], and [[Monster Munch]]). British restaurant critic [[Tanya Gold]] argues that Monster Munch "is absolutely not a crisp".<ref>{{cite news |title=Monster Munch crisps reviewed |url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/repulsive-depraved-and-oddly-political-monster-munch-crisps-reviewed/?zephr_sso_ott=ERtp4L |access-date=17 April 2023 |work=The Spectator}}</ref>

[[Sweet potato]] chips are eaten in Korea, New Zealand, and Japan; parsnip, [[beetroot]], and carrot crisps are available in the United Kingdom. India is famous{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} for a large number of localized 'chips shops', selling not only potato chips, but also other varieties such as plantain chips, tapioca chips, [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]] chips, and even carrot chips. Plantain chips, also known as [[Plantain (cooking)#Chifles|chifles]] or [[tostones]], are also sold in the Western Hemisphere from Canada to Chile. In the Philippines, banana chips can be found sold at local stores. In Kenya, chips are made from [[arrowroot]] and [[cassava]]. In the United Kingdom, Sweden, Finland, and Australia, a new variety of Pringles made from rice was released in 2010 and marketed as lower in fat than its potato counterparts.<ref name="Olson"/>
