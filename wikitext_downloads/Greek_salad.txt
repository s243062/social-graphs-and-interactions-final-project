Common additions include green [[bell pepper]] or [[caper|caper berries]] (especially on the [[Cyclades|Cyclades islands]]). Greek salad is often imagined as a farmer's breakfast or lunch, as its ingredients resemble those that a Greek farmer might have on hand.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Zhang|first1=Jenny|title=A Modern Tradition: Greek Salad|url=http://organicallyblissful.com/modern-tradition-greek-salad/|website=Organically Blissful|access-date=15 December 2016}}</ref>

== Outside Greece ==

Outside Greece, "Greek salad" may be a lettuce salad with Greek-inspired ingredients, even though the original dish is distinguished by the absence of lettuce. Meanwhile, the variant without lettuce may be called {{Lang|el-Latn|horiatiki}}, 'peasant salad', or 'village salad'.

However in most European countries, including the UK, the dish broadly resembles the original, albeit often with non-Greek substitutions such as another cheese since feta cheese enjoys [[protected designation of origin]] status.

In an American-style Greek salad, [[lettuce]], tomatoes, feta (often served in multiple cube-shaped cuttings mixed with the vegetables), and olives are the most standard elements, but cucumbers, [[peperoncini]] (pickled hot peppers), bell peppers, onions, [[radish]]es, [[Dolma|''dolmades'']], and anchovies/[[Sardines as food|sardines]] are common. Regional variants may include unusual components, e.g. in [[Detroit]], [[beet]]s, and in the [[Tampa Bay area]], [[potato salad]]. Dressings containing various herbs and seasonings are frequently used in the U.S. These styles of Greek salad are rarely encountered in Greece.

Various other salads have also been called "Greek" in the English language in the last century, including some with no apparent connection to [[Greek cuisine]].

Some spreads and dips found in the [[meze]] of [[Greek cuisine]] are also called "salads" in Greek, such as ''[[melitzanosalata]]'', ''[[taramasalata]]'' and [[tzatziki]].
