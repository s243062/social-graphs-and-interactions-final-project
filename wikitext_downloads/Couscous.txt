== Etymology ==
The word "couscous" (alternately ''cuscus'' or ''kuskus'') was first noted in early 17th century French, from Arabic kuskus, from kaskasa 'to pound', and is probably of [[Berber languages|Berber]] origin.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.centrederechercheberbere.fr/tl_files/doc-pdf/couscous.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816224311/http://www.centrederechercheberbere.fr/tl_files/doc-pdf/couscous.pdf |archive-date=2011-08-16 |url-status=live|title=Couscous : sur l'étymologie du mot|last=Chaker|first=Salem|website=[[INALCO]] - [[Centre de Recherche Berbère]]}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGQovjGKj4IC|title=Couscous, boulgour et polenta.

This widespread geographical dispersion of the term strongly suggests its local Berber origin, lending further support to its likely Berber roots as Algerian linguist [[Salem Chaker]] suggests.<ref name=":0" />

The Berber root *KS means "well formed, well rolled, rounded."<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" /> Numerous names and pronunciations for couscous exist around the world.<ref name="foucauld">{{cite book |last1=Foucauld |first1=Charles de |title=Dictionnaire touareg-français : dialecte de l'Ahaggar |date=1950–1952 |publisher=Impr. nationale de France |location=Paris |url=https://archive.org/details/DictionnaireTouareg-francaisDialecteDeLAhaggar |language=fr|access-date=May 19, 2022}}</ref>{{rp|919}}

[[File:Algerian couscous from Kabylia.jpg|thumb|[[Algeria]]n couscous from [[Kabylia]].|left]]
It is unclear when couscous originated.

According to food writer [[Charles Perry (food writer)|Charles Perry]], couscous originated among the [[Berbers]] of Algeria and Morocco between the end of the 11th-century [[Zirid dynasty]], modern-day [[Algeria]], and the rise of the 13th-century [[Almohad Caliphate]].<ref name=":3" /> The historian Hady Idris noted that couscous is attested to during the [[Hafsid dynasty]], but not the Zirid dynasty.<ref name=":3" />

In the 12th century, [[Berber cuisine|Maghrebi]] cooks were preparing dishes of non-mushy grains by stirring flour with water to create light, round balls of couscous dough that could be steamed.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H7MwDwAAQBAJ|title=Medieval Cuisine of the Islamic World: A Concise History with 174 Recipes|last=Zaouali|first=Lilia|publisher=Univ of California Press|date=September 2009|isbn=978-0-520-26174-7|page=xiii|language=en|access-date=May 19, 2022}}</ref>

The historian [[Maxime Rodinson]] found three recipes for couscous from the 13th century [[Arabic literature#Culinary|Arabic cookbook]] ''Kitab al-Wusla ila al-Habib'', written by an [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] author,<ref name=":3" /> and the anonymous Arabic cooking book ''[[Kitab al tabikh fi-l-Maghrib wa-l-Andalus fi `asr al-Muwahhidin, limu'allif majhul|Kitab al tabikh]]'' and Ibn Razin al-Tujibi's ''Fadalat al-khiwan'' also contain recipes.<ref name=":1" />

Couscous is believed to have been spread among the inhabitants of the Iberian Peninsula by the Berber dynasties of the 13th century, though it is no longer found in traditional Spanish or Portuguese cuisine. In modern-day [[Trapani]], [[Sicily]], the dish is still made to the medieval recipe of [[Andalusia]]n author Ibn Razin al-Tujibi. Ligurian families that moved from [[Tabarka]] to [[Sardinia]] brought the dish with them to [[Carloforte]] in the 18th century.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Cuisine of the Islamic World: A Concise History with 174 Recipes|last=Zaouali|first=Lilia|publisher=Univ of California Press|date=September 2009|isbn=978-0-520-26174-7|pages=45–46|language=en}}</ref>

Known in France since the 16th century, it was brought into French cuisine at the beginning of the 20th century via the [[French colonial empire]] and the Pieds-Noirs.

== Preparation ==
[[File:Tunisian brown couscous with vegetables.JPG|thumb|Brown couscous with vegetables in Tunisia.]]
Couscous is traditionally made from semolina, the hardest part of the grain of [[durum wheat]] (the hardest of all forms of wheat), which resists the grinding of the millstone. The semolina is sprinkled with water and rolled with the hands to form small pellets, sprinkled with dry flour to keep them separate, and then sieved. Any pellets that are too small to be finished, granules of couscous fall through the sieve and are again rolled and sprinkled with dry semolina and rolled into pellets. This labor-intensive process continues until all the semolina has been formed into tiny couscous granules. In the traditional method of preparing couscous, groups of people come together to make large batches over several days, which are then dried in the sun and used for several months. Handmade couscous may need to be rehydrated as it is prepared; this is achieved by a process of moistening and steaming over stew until the couscous reaches the desired light and fluffy consistency.<ref name="asbell">{{Cite book |title=The New Whole Grain Cookbook: Terrific Recipes Using Farro, Quinoa, Brown Rice, Barley, and Many Other Delicious and Nutritious Grains |last=Asbell |first=Robin |date=August 2007|publisher=Chronicle Books |isbn=978-1-4521-0042-5}}</ref>

In some regions, couscous is made from [[Farina (food)|farina]] or coarsely ground [[barley]] or [[pearl millet]].

[[File:Couscoussier.jpg|thumb|A ''kiskas'' (French: ''[[couscoussier]]''), a traditional steamer for couscous.]]
In modern times, couscous production is largely mechanized, and the product is sold worldwide. This couscous can be sauteed before it is cooked in water or another liquid.<ref name="asbell" /> Properly cooked couscous is light and fluffy, not gummy or gritty.

Traditionally, North Africans use a [[food steamer]] (called a ''taseksut'' in the [[Berber language]], a {{lang|ar|كِسْكَاس}} ''kiskas'' in  Arabic or a ''[[couscoussier]]'' in French). The base is a tall metal pot shaped like an oil jar, where the meat and vegetables are cooked as a stew. On top of the base, a steamer sits where the couscous is cooked, absorbing the flavours from the stew. The steamer's lid has holes around its edge so steam can escape. It is also possible to use a pot with a steamer insert. If the holes are too big, the steamer can be lined with damp [[cheesecloth]].

The couscous that is sold in most [[Western culture|Western]] [[grocery store]]s is usually pre-steamed and dried. It is typically prepared by adding 1.5 measures of boiling water or stock to each measure of couscous and then leaving it covered tightly for about five minutes. Pre-steamed couscous takes less time to prepare than regular couscous, most dried pasta, or dried grains (such as rice). Packaged sets of quick-preparation couscous and canned vegetables, and generally meat, are routinely sold in European grocery stores and supermarkets. Couscous is widely consumed in France, where it was introduced by [[Maghreb]] immigrants<ref name="auto">{{cite web |last1=Randall |first1=Colin |date=31 March 2006 |title=French abandon traditional cuisine in favour of couscous |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/1514459/French-abandon-traditional-cuisine-in-favour-of-couscous.html |access-date=May 19, 2022 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref> and voted the third most popular dish in a 2011 survey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tns-sofres.com/points-de-vue/79A4BE8A098F4BBFA11B939A135302CA.aspx|title=Les plats préférés des Français|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408173836/http://www.tns-sofres.com/points-de-vue/79A4BE8A098F4BBFA11B939A135302CA.aspx|archive-date=April 8, 2012|access-date=May 19, 2022}}, enquête réalisée en août 2011 pour le magazine Vie Pratique Gourmand auprès d'un échantillon national de {{formatnum:999}} personnes représentatif de l'ensemble de la population âgée de 18 ans et plus, interrogées en face à face.

In December 2020, Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia obtained official recognition for the knowledge, know-how, and practices pertaining to the production and consumption of couscous on the ''Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity'' by [[UNESCO]]. The joint submission by the four countries was hailed as an "example of international cooperation."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/knowledge-know-how-and-practices-pertaining-to-the-production-and-consumption-of-couscous-01602|title=UNESCO - Knowledge, know-how and practices pertaining to the production and consumption of couscous|publisher= UNESCO|language=en|date=December 1, 2020|access-date=May 19, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/couscous-joins-unesco-intangible-cultural-heritage-list/a-55967754|title=Couscous joins UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage list|website=[[Deutsche Welle]]|language=en-GB|date= December 17, 2020|access-date=May 19, 2022}}</ref>

== Local variations ==
[[File:Couscous Tfaya 3.jpg|thumb|Moroccan couscous with ''[[tfaya]]'' and roasted chicken.]]
Couscous proper is about 2&nbsp;mm in diameter, but there also exists a larger variety (3&nbsp;mm more) known as ''berkoukes'', as well as an ultra-fine version (around 1&nbsp;mm).<ref name=":3"/> In Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya, it is generally served with vegetables ([[carrot]]s, [[potato]]es, and [[turnip]]s) cooked in a spicy or mild [[broth]] or stew, usually with some meat (generally, [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[lamb and mutton|lamb, or mutton]]).[[File:MoroccanCouscous.jpg|thumb|Couscous with vegetables, meat, and ''[[tfaya]]''.]]

=== Algeria ===
[[File:Algerian Couscous from Biskra.jpg|thumb|Algerian couscous from Biskra.]]
[[Algerian couscous]] is a traditional staple food in Algeria, and it plays an important role in Algerian culture and cuisine. It is commonly served with vegetables, meat, or fish. In Algeria, there are various types of couscous dishes.<ref name=":3" />

=== Egypt ===
In Egypt, couscous ({{langx|arz|كسكسي}}, ''{{Transliteration|arz|koskosi}}'') is traditionally prepared and consumed as a sweet dish, differing notably from the savory couscous dishes commonly associated with other North African cuisines. It is typically served for breakfast, as a light evening meal, or as a dessert. The preparation involves steaming or soaking the couscous with melted butter and hot water, after which it is topped with a variety of sweet ingredients. Common toppings include sugar (white, brown, or powdered), cinnamon, grated coconut, raisins, and assorted nuts such as almonds, walnuts, or hazelnuts. In some variations, sweetened condensed milk may also be used.<ref>{{cite web |last=Nasr |first=Noor |title=Egyptian Couscous |url=https://fulbrightfeasting.wordpress.com/2011/03/12/egyptian-couscous/ |website=Fulbright Feasting |date=March 12, 2011 |access-date=March 27, 2025}}</ref>

=== Tunisia ===
[[File:Fish couscous from Kerkenah, Tunisia, August 16th, 2007.jpg|thumb|Fish couscous from Tunisia.]]
In Tunisia, couscous is usually spicy, made with [[harissa]] sauce, and served commonly with vegetables and meat, including lamb, fish, seafood, beef, and sometimes (in southern regions) camel. [[Fish as food|Fish]] couscous is a Tunisian specialty and can also be made with [[octopus as food|octopus]], [[squid as food|squid]] or other [[seafood]] in a hot, red, spicy sauce.
Couscous can also be served as a dessert. It is then called Masfuf. Masfuf can also contain raisins, grapes, or pomegranate seeds.

=== Libya ===
In Libya, couscous is mostly served with lamb (but sometimes [[camel meat]] or, rarely, beef) in Tripoli and the western parts of Libya, but not during official ceremonies or weddings. Another way to eat couscous is as a dessert; it is prepared with dates, sesame, and pure honey and is locally referred to as ''maghrood''.

=== Malta ===
In Malta, small round pasta slightly larger than typical couscous is known as ''kusksu''. It is commonly used in a dish of the same name, which includes broad beans (known in [[Maltese language|Maltese]] as ''ful'') and ''ġbejniet'', a local type of cheese.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2016-01-05 |title=Kusksu - A traditional Maltese soup made with broad beans, peas and giant couscous. |url=https://www.amaltesemouthful.com/kusksu-beautiful-maltese-soup-start-new-year/ |access-date=2023-08-26 |website=A Maltese Mouthful |language=en-US |archive-date=July 19, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210719094532/https://www.amaltesemouthful.com/kusksu-beautiful-maltese-soup-start-new-year/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Mauritania ===
In Mauritania, the couscous uses large wheat grains (''mabroum'') and is darker than the yellow couscous of Morocco. It is cooked with lamb, beef, or camel meat together with vegetables, primarily onion, tomato, and carrots, then mixed with a sauce and served with [[ghee]], locally known as ''dhen''.

== Similar foods ==
Couscous is made from crushed wheat flour rolled into its constituent granules or pearls, making it distinct from pasta, even pasta such as [[orzo]] and [[risoni]] of similar size, which is made from ground wheat and either molded or extruded. Couscous and pasta have similar nutritional value, although pasta is usually more refined.<ref name="notpasta"/>

Several dishes worldwide are also made from granules, like those of couscous rolled from flour from grains or other milled or grated starchy crops.
