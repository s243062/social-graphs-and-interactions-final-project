'''Käsespätzle''' (German for "spätzle with cheese", also called ''Käsknöpfle'' in [[Vorarlberg]] and [[Liechtenstein]] or ''Kasspatzl'' in [[Tyrol]], [[Austria]] and [[Bavaria]]) is a traditional dish of the [[Germany|German]] regions of [[Swabian cuisine|Swabia]], [[Baden cuisine|Baden]] and [[Allgäu]], and also in the Austrian regions Vorarlberg and Tyrol, as well as [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Switzerland]].

== Preparation ==
Hot [[spätzle]] and grated cheese such as [[Emmentaler]] or [[granular cheese]] are layered alternately and finally topped with [[fried onions]]. After adding each layer, the {{lang|de|käsespätzle}} is baked until all the cheese is melted.{{cn|date=August 2025}}

Accompanying side dishes are green [[salad]]s or [[potato salad]]. In some parts of [[Vorarlberg]] and also [[Liechtenstein]] {{lang|de|käsespätzle}} is usually served with [[apple sauce]]. Leftovers of käsespätzle can be pan-fried with butter.{{cn|date=August 2025}}

In Tyrol, käsespätzle are prepared with [[Bergkäse]] or [[Emmental cheese]], optionally with both. In [[Vorarlberg]] two different cheese varieties are dominating, so in [[Montafon]] the cooks use Montafon sour cheese and in [[Bregenz Forest]] they use Bergkäse and Räßkäse, a local hard cheese.<ref>''Haubenküche zum Beisl-Preis. 5-Euro-Rezepte von Österreichs besten Köchen.'' page 130: Vorarlberger Käsespätzle; Krenn, Wien 2005, {{ISBN|3-902351-67-5}}.</ref>

Side dishes in Vorarlberg are butter and yellowly tarnished onion rings.<ref>Franz Maier-Bruck: Das große Sacher-Kochbuch, Schuler Verlags GesmbH, Herrsching, licensed edition 1975, page 397 {{ISBN|3-88199-388-6}} </ref>

Different variations are found with [[Limburger]], [[Weisslacker]] or Vorarlberger Bergkäse.
