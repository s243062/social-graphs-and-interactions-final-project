'''''Sinigang''''', sometimes anglicized as '''sour broth''', is a Filipino soup or stew characterized by its sour and savory taste. It is most often associated with [[tamarind]] ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''sampalok''), although it can use other sour fruits and leaves as the souring agent such as unripe mangoes or rice vinegar. It is one of the more popular dishes in [[Filipino cuisine]]. This soup, like most Filipino dishes, is usually accompanied by rice.

==Origin==
''Sinigáng'' means "stewed [dish]"; it is [[Nominalization|nominalized]] in the form of the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] [[verb]] ''sigáng'', "to stew".<ref>{{cite web |title=sigang |url=https://www.tagalog-dictionary.com/search?word=sigang |website=Tagalog-Dictionary.com |access-date=December 16, 2018}}</ref> While present nationwide, ''sinigáng'' is seen to be culturally [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] in origin, thus the similar sour stews and soups found in the [[Visayas]] and [[Mindanao]] (like ''[[linarang]]'') and in Pampanga (''bulanglang''). These are regarded as different dishes and differ in the ingredients used. [[Fish sauce]] is a common condiment for this stew.

Sinigang is most often associated with [[tamarind]] in modern times, but it originally referred to any meat or seafood cooked in a sour and acidic broth, similar to but differentiated from ''[[paksiw]]'' (which uses [[vinegar]]).<ref name="pamaran">{{cite news |last1=Pamaran |first1=Maan D'Asis |title=The Filipino-Spanish food connection |url=https://www.pressreader.com/philippines/philippine-daily-inquirer/20161012/282437053635905 |access-date=December 16, 2018 |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=October 12, 2016}}</ref> Other variations of the dish derive their sourness from native ingredients. These souring agents include unripe [[mango]]es, rice vinegar, [[Phanera purpurea|butterfly tree]] leaves (''alibangbang''), citruses (including the native [[calamansi]] and ''[[biasong]]''), [[Sandoricum koetjape|santol]], [[bilimbi]] (''kamias'' or ''iba''), [[Phyllanthus acidus|gooseberry tree]] fruits (''karmay''), [[Garcinia binucao|binukaw]] fruits (also ''batuan''), and [[Spondias pinnata|''libas'']] fruits, among others.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Souring Agents of Sinigang |url=https://pinoytrees.blogspot.com/2009/09/souring-agents-of-sinigang.html |website=Our Philippine Trees |date=September 25, 2009 |access-date=April 17, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Sinigang na Salmon at Bauhinia Filipino Cuisine |url=https://flavoursofiloilo.blogspot.com/2014/03/sinigang-na-salmon-at-bauhinia-filipino.html |website=Flavours of Iloilo |access-date=April 17, 2019}}</ref> [[Guava]], introduced to the Philippines via the [[Manila galleon]]s, is also used.<ref>[https://pinoytrees.blogspot.com/2009/09/souring-agents-of-sinigang.html The Souring Agents of Sinigang]</ref> Seasoning powder or [[bouillon cube]]s with a tamarind base are commercial alternatives to using natural fruits.<ref>[http://www.filipinofoodrecipes.net/sinigang.htm Sinigang Recipe]</ref><ref>[https://recipenijuan.com/sinigang-baboy-recipe/ Sinigang na Baboy Recipe]</ref>

Sinigang typically uses meat or seafood (e.g., fish, pork, beef, shrimp, or chicken) stewed with [[tamarind]], [[tomato]]es, [[garlic]], and [[onion]]s. Other vegetables commonly used in the making of sinigang include [[okra]], [[taro]] [[corm]]s (''gabi'', which serves as a starchy broth thickener<ref>{{Cite web|date=January 27, 2013|title=Sinigang na Baboy|url=https://www.kawalingpinoy.com/sinigang-na-baboy/|access-date=August 29, 2021|website=Kawaling Pinoy|language=en-US}}</ref>), white [[Daikon|radish]] (''labanós''), [[water spinach]] (''kangkóng''), [[yardlong beans]] (''sitaw'') and [[eggplant]] (''talóng''). Most Filipinos like to cook sinigang with [[Siling haba|long green peppers]] (''siling haba'') to enhance the taste and add a little spice to the dish. Another variation includes adding locally made [[miso]].

''[[Sinampalukang manók]]'' or ''sinampalukan'' is technically not a variation of sinigang, as the chicken has to be sautéed in ginger first instead of all the ingredients being placed simultaneously into the pot and brought to a boil. ''Sinampalukan'' is also distinguished by its use of shredded tamarind leaves, and is usually made together with [[ginger]], onions, tomatoes, eggplant and other vegetables.<ref name="kp">{{cite web |first1=Lalaine|last1=Manalo|title=Sinampalukang Manok |url=https://www.kawalingpinoy.com/sinampalukang-manok/ |website=Kawaling Pinoy |date=August 14, 2013 |access-date=April 13, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Sinampalukan Manok (Tamarind'd Chicken) |url=http://80breakfasts.com/sinampalukan-manok-tamarindd-chicken/ |website=80 Breakfasts |date=February 16, 2009 |access-date=April 13, 2019}}</ref>

Other Filipino dishes that are similar to ''sinigang'' but distinct include ''[[pinangat na isda]]'' from [[Southern Luzon]] and ''[[linarang]]'' from [[Cebu]].

There are also similar soured beef stews. They include the ''[[cansi]]'' from the [[Western Visayas]] islands which use beef and [[breadfruit]] and is soured with [[Garcinia binucao|batuan]] or [[bilimbi]] fruits. Because it resembles a cross between ''[[bulalo]]'' and ''sinigang'' it is sometimes known as ''sinigang na bulalo''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Reyes |first1=Gladys |title=Ilonggo Food: Bacolod Cansi Recipe |url=https://www.experiencenegros.com/ilonggo-food-bacolod-cansi-recipe/ |website=Experience Negros |date=July 31, 2014 |access-date=October 23, 2019}}</ref> Another soured beef stew is ''[[sinanglaw]]'' from [[Ilocos Region|Ilocos]] which is soured with bilimbi or tamarind, but is unique in that it also includes bitter ingredients like [[bitter gourd]] or bile, as is common in Ilocano cuisine.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sinanglaw |url=https://www.angsarap.net/2012/03/06/sinanglaw/ |website=Ang Sarap |date=March 6, 2012 |access-date=October 17, 2020}}</ref>

Around the east coast of [[Peninsular Malaysia]], particularly in the states of [[Kelantan]] and [[Terengganu]], there is a dish called ''singgang'' that is considered a close relative of ''sinigang''.<ref>{{cite news |title=NCCA's 'Sinigang versus Adobo' poll divides the nation|url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/lifestyle/food/566753/ncca-s-sinigang-versus-adobo-poll-divides-the-nation/story/ |work=GMA News Online|date=May 18, 2016|access-date=January 15, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title='Sinigang' and 'asocena' aren't exclusive to Filipinos|newspaper=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=October 8, 2009|access-date=January 17, 2022|author=Reggie Aspiras|url=https://www.pressreader.com/philippines/philippine-daily-inquirer-1109/20091008/282368330700218}}</ref> The common ingredients found in singgang are lemongrass, galangal, garlic, chili and [[asam gelugur]] as a souring agent.
