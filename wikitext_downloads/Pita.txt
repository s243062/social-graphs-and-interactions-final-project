Some say that English borrowed the word directly from Modern Hebrew, which had revived the Aramaic term in the preceding decades.<ref name="Marks 2010" /> However, native Modern Hebrew nouns are characterized by final stress.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-11-13 |title=Pita |url=https://hebrew-academy.org.il/%d7%a4%d7%99%d7%aa%d7%94/ |access-date=2025-07-07 |website=Academy of the Hebrew Language |language=he-IL}}</ref>

In [[Greek language|Greek]], {{Transliteration|el|pita}} ({{lang|el|πίτα}}) is understood by default to refer to the thicker, pocketless Greek pita, whereas the thinner ''khubz''-style pita is referred to as {{Transliteration|el|aravikí pita}} ({{lang|el|αραβική πίτα}}, {{lit|Arabic pastry}}).

==History==
Pita has roots in the prehistoric flatbreads of the Near East.<ref name="Marks 2010"/> There is evidence from about 14,500 years ago, during the [[Stone Age]], that the [[Natufian]] people in what is now [[Jordan]] made a kind of flatbread from wild cereal grains.<ref>{{Citation |year=2018 |title=World's oldest bread found at prehistoric site in Jordan |journal=The Jerusalem Post |url=https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Worlds-oldest-bread-found-at-prehistoric-site-in-Jordan-562680 |access-date=16 July 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/archaeology/bread-history-cooking-stone-age-middle-east-archaeology-discovery-a8450276.html|title=Archaeologists find world's oldest bread and new evidence of sophisticated cooking dating back 14,000 years|work=The Independent|access-date=17 July 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref> Ancient wheat and barley were among the [[Neolithic founder crops|earliest domesticated crops]] in the [[Neolithic]] period of about 10,000 years ago, in the [[Fertile Crescent]]. By 4,000 years ago, bread was of central importance in societies such as the [[Babylon]]ian culture of [[Mesopotamia]], where the earliest-known written records and recipes of bread-making originate,<ref>{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|access-date=16 March 2019|title=Mastering the Art of Babylonian Cooking|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/03/nyregion/mastering-the-art-of-babylonian-cooking.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=3 January 1988|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> and where pita-like flatbreads cooked in a ''tinûru'' (''tannur'' or ''tandoor'') were a basic element of the diet, and much the same as today's [[tandoor bread]], [[taboon bread]],<ref>{{cite book|first1=Jean|last1=Bottéro|title=The Oldest Cuisine in the World: Cooking in Mesopotamia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PxnaaTzC8tMC&pg=PA47|pages=47–49|publisher=University of Chicago Press|date=15 April 2004|isbn=978-0-226-06735-3|via=Google Books}}</ref> and [[laffa]], an Iraqi flatbread with many similarities with pita. However, there is no record of the steam-puffed, two-layer "pocket pita" in the ancient texts, or in any of the medieval Arab cookbooks, and according to food historians such as [[Charles Perry (food writer)|Charles Perry]] and [[Gil Marks]] it was likely a later development.<ref name="Marks 2010"/><ref>{{cite book|first1=Anat|last1=Helman|title=Jews and Their Foodways|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q7CYCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA196|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=28 October 2015|isbn=978-0-19-026543-4|via=Google Books}}</ref>

==Preparation==
[[File:PikiWiki_Israel_30304_Events_in_Israel.jpg|thumb|alt=Six pitas baking on a circular pan in a wood-fired oven|Pita baking in [[Nazareth]]]]
Most pita breads are [[baking|baked]] at high temperatures ({{Convert|450|-|475|F|C|order=flip|disp=or|round=5}}), which turns the water in the [[dough]] into steam, thus causing the pita to puff up and form a pocket.<ref name=McNulty /> When removed from the [[oven]], the layers of baked dough remain separated inside the deflated pita, which allows the bread to be opened to form a pocket. However, pita is sometimes baked without pockets and is called "pocket-less pita". Pita is traditionally served fresh from the oven (typically a wood-fired oven similar to a [[pizza oven]]). It is best either soon after baking or on the same day, and can be served warm.<ref name="zahav">{{cite book |last1=Solomonov |first1=Mike |title=Zahav |publisher=HMH}}</ref>

Modern commercial pita bread is prepared on advanced automatic production lines, processing {{Convert|100000|lb|kg|order=flip|adj=on}} silos of flour at a time and producing thousands of pitas per hour. The ovens used in commercial baking are much hotter than traditional clay ovens—{{Convert|800|-|900|F|C|-1|order=flip}}—so each pita is baked only for one minute. The pita are then air-cooled for about 20 minutes on conveyor belts before being shipped immediately or else stored in commercial [[freezer]]s kept at a temperature of {{convert|10|F|C|0|order=flip}}.<ref name="McNulty">{{cite web|last1=McNulty|first1=Mary|title=Pita Bread|url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-5/Pita-Bread.html|website=How products are made|access-date=8 May 2018|date=2007}}</ref>

==Culinary use==
[[File:Nablus souq pita 118 - Aug 2011.jpg|right|thumb|Pita bread at a [[Bazaar|souq]] in [[Nablus]].]]
Pita can be used to scoop sauces or dips, such as [[hummus]], or to wrap [[kebab]]s, [[gyro (food)|gyros]], [[Sabich]] or [[falafel]] in the manner of [[sandwich]]es. It can also be cut and baked into crispy pita chips.

In [[Turkish cuisine]], the word ''pide'' may refer to three different styles of bread: a flatbread similar to that eaten in [[Greece]] and [[Arab countries]], a [[pizza]]-like dish, [[İçli Pide|içli pide]], where the filling is placed on the (often boat-shaped) dough before baking,<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.recipetineats.com/pide-turkish-flat-bread/ |title= Pide – Turkish Flat Bread |author= Nagi Maehashi |date=  June 28, 2025 |publisher=

The first type of ''pide'' is used to wrap various styles of [[kebab]], while the second is topped with cheese, [[ground meat]], or other fresh or [[Curing (food preservation)|cured]] meats, and/or vegetables. Regional variations in the shape, baking technique, and toppings create distinctive styles for each region.

In [[Cyprus]], pita is typically rounder, fluffier and baked on a cast-iron skillet. It is used for [[souvlaki]]a, [[sheftalia]], [[halloumi]] with [[lountza]], and gyros. In [[Greek cuisine|Greece]] the word ''pita'' means "pastry" and is usually used for various cakes and pastries like [[spanakopita]] (spinach pie) and [[karydopita]] (walnut cake) unrelated to the English language "pita" flatbread.<ref>Ιφιγενεια Βιρβιδακη, Νενα Δημητριου, Νικολετα Μακρυωνιτου, Καλλιοπη Πατερα, "[http://www.kathimerini.gr/875774/article/gastronomos/agora/ta-kalytera-ywmia-twn-a8hnwn Tα καλύτερα ψωμιά των Αθηνών]", Γαστρονόμος, ''Η Καθημερινή'', 21 September 2016</ref> Traditional breads in Greek cuisine are leavened loaves,<ref>Ιφιγενεια Βιρβιδακη, Νενα Δημητριου, Νικολετα Μακρυωνιτου, Καλλιοπη Πατερα, "Tα καλύτερα ψωμιά των Αθηνών", Γαστρονόμος, ''Η Καθημερινή'', 21 September 2016 [http://www.kathimerini.gr/875774/article/gastronomos/agora/ta-kalytera-ywmia-twn-a8hnwn]</ref> such as the round καρβέλι karvéli or the oblong φραντζόλα frantzóla. This style of pita flatbread, in the English language meaning of the word, is almost exclusively used as a wrap for ''souvlaki'' or [[gyro (food)|gyros]] usually garnished with some combination of [[tzatziki]] sauce, tomatoes, onions, and [[french fries]].

[[Druze]] pita is filled with [[labneh]] (thick yoghurt) and topped with [[olive oil]] and [[za'atar]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Lonely Planet Israel & the Palestinian Territories|first=Anita |last=Isalska|year= 2018| isbn= 978-1-78701-924-9| page =5|publisher=Lonely Planet|quote=}}</ref>

In [[Bosnia]], [[Croatia]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Serbia]], the local style of pitta is known as ''lepinja'', ''somun'', ''purlenka'' or ''pitica'', and is the most common bread served with barbecued food like [[ćevapi]], [[pljeskavica]], [[kebapche]] or grilled [[sausages]]. The word ''pita'' itself, on the other hand, is used for ''pie'' in the general sense in all local languages, and is mostly used for [[börek]] or various sweet [[phyllo]] pastry dishes (with the exception of [[baklava]] which is always called that).

Pita is also present in the cuisine of the [[Aromanians]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://litere.hyperion.ro/hypercultura/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Bara-Mariana.pdf|title=Constructing Armân/Vlach Ethnic Identity|first=Mariana|last=Bara|journal=HyperCultura|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1–11|year=2014}}</ref>
