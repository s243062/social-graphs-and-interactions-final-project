A '''dürüm''' ({{IPA|tr|dyˈɾym}}, "roll") or '''dürme''' is a [[wrap (food)|wrap]] that is usually filled with typical [[döner kebab]] ingredients.<ref name="Heinzelmann2014">{{cite book|author=Ursula Heinzelmann|title=Beyond Bratwurst: A History of Food in Germany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HUedAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT347|date=15 April 2014|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1-78023-302-4|pages=347–}}</ref> The wrap is made from [[lavash]] or [[saj bread|yufka]] flatbreads. It is common as a street food in [[Turkey]] and many other [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe|European countries]], but can also be found in sit-down restaurants.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 10 best Turkish street foods |website=TimeOut |url=https://www.timeout.com/istanbul/restaurants/the-best-turkish-street-foods}}</ref><br>
It usually costs about 10% more than a normal döner. Some people prefer it to the döner, either because the portion is bigger or because the fillings-to-bread ratio is higher in a dürüm.
<br>Most döner joints in Germany where the bread is freshly baked use the same leavened dough portion as for the döner bun, but rolled out into a [[flatbread]] wrap. <br>
Another variation is made from a reheated [[lahmacun]], filled with the same ingredients as the döner kebab, rolled up as a dürüm.
