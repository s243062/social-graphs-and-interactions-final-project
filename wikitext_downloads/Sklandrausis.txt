Traditionally, the dough is cut in {{convert|10-20|cm}} rounds, then the edges of the dough are turned up. The dough is filled with a thin layer of potato filling, topped with a thicker layer of carrot filling, then baked. Sklandrausis is served with [[milk]] and [[honey]] or with ''{{Interlanguage link|skābputra|lv|skābputra}}'' (a fermented milk-and-barley gruel).

== Reception ==
