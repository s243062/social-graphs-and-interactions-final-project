The designation {{lang|de|Wiener Schnitzel}} first appeared in the 19th century, with the first known mention in a [[cookbook]] from 1831.<ref>{{cite book |last=Neudecker |first=Maria Anna |title=Allerneuestes allgemeines Kochbuch |location=Prague |date=1831}}</ref> In the popular southern German cookbook by [[Katharina Prato]], it was mentioned as {{lang|de|eingebröselte Kalbsschnitzchen}} (roughly, "breaded veal cutlets").<ref name="pohl">{{cite book |last=Pohl |first=Heinz Dieter |title=Die österreichische Küchensprache. Ein Lexikon der typisch österreichischen kulinarischen Besonderheiten (mit sprachwissenschaftlichen Erläuterungen) |publisher=Praesens-Verlag |location=Vienna |date=2007 |isbn=978-3-7069-0452-0 |pages=154–155|language=de}}<!--(''Studia interdisciplinaria Ænipontana 11'')--></ref>

According to a tale, Field Marshal [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz]] brought the recipe from [[Italy]] to Vienna in 1857. In 2007, [[linguist]] [[Heinz-Dieter Pohl]] could prove that this story had been invented.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rund ums Wiener Schnitzel – ein Beitrag zur Sach- und Wortgeschichte |url=http://members.chello.at/heinz.pohl/Wiener_Schnitzel.pdf |website=Heinz Pohl Personal Homepage |access-date=18 April 2017|language=de}}</ref> According to Pohl, the dish is first mentioned in connection with Radetzky in 1869 in an Italian gastronomy book (''Guida gastronomica d'Italia''), which was published in German in 1871 as ''Italien tafelt'', and it is claimed that the story instead concerned the ''[[cotoletta alla milanese]]''. Before this time, the story was unknown in [[Austria]]. The Radetzky legend is however based on this book, which claims that a Count Attems, an [[adjutant]] to the emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] gave a notice from Radetzky about the situation in [[Lombardy]] and mentioned a tasty veal steak in a margin note. After Radetzky had returned, the emperor personally requested the recipe from him.<ref name="pohl" />

Pohl relates this anecdote with the words: "This story is scientifically meaningless, it does not cite any sources and it is not mentioned […] in the literature about Radetzky. No such Count Attems appears in any biographical work about the Austrian monarchy, which would have corresponded to this time and position."<ref name="pohl" />

Pohl doubts that Wiener schnitzel came from Italy at all, with the basis that in the other "imported dishes" in [[Austrian cuisine]], the original concept is mentioned, even if in Germanised form, such as in [[goulash]] or [[palatschinke]], and the schnitzel does not appear even in specialised cookbooks about [[Italian cuisine]].<ref>Pohl, Heinz Dieter: [http://www1.ku-eichstaett.de/SLF/EngluVglSW/pohl1061.pdf Zur bairisch-österreichischen Küchensprache] (PDF)</ref>

Pohl hints that there had been other dishes in Austrian cuisine before the Schnitzel that were breaded and deep-fried, such as the ''Backhendl'', first mentioned in a cookbook from 1719. The Schnitzel was then mentioned in the 19th century as ''{{lang|de|Wiener Schnitzel}}'' analogically to the ''{{lang|de|[[Backhendl]]}}''.<ref name="pohl" />

In 1887, [[Edward Frederick Knight|E. F. Knight]] wrote of a Wiener schnitzel ordered in a [[Rotterdam]] cafe, "as far as I could make out, the lowest layer of a Wienerschnitzel consists of juicy veal steaks and slices of lemon peel; the next layer is composed of sardines; then come sliced gherkins, capers, and diverse mysteries; a delicate sauce flavours the whole, and the result is a gastronomic dream."<ref>{{cite book |title=The "Falcon" On the Baltic: A Coasting Voyage From Hammersmith to Copenhagen in a Three-Ton Yacht |first=E. F. |last=Knight |date=1888 |page=76}}</ref>

== Preparation ==
[[File:Wiener Schnitzel at restaurant Faro, Helsinki.jpg|thumb|right|In the Nordic countries, Wiener schnitzel is typically also garnished with a slice of anchovy and capers.<ref>Snellman.fi: [https://www.snellman.fi/fi/reseptit/wieninleike ''Wieninleike resepit ja ohje''] (in Finnish): ''Ja muualla kuin Itävallassa, saa wieninleike usein seurakseen myös anjovista ja kapriksia, josta muodostuukin kerrassaan herkullinen yhdistelmä!'' ("And outside Austria, the Wienerschnitzel is often accompanied by anchovy and capers which make a delicious combination!")</ref>]]
The dish is prepared from butterfly-cut veal slices, about {{convert|4|mm|in|frac=16|abbr=on}} in thickness and lightly pounded flat, slightly salted, and rolled in flour, whipped eggs, and bread crumbs. The bread crumbs must not be pressed into the meat, so that they stay dry and can be "souffléd", enabling the breading to separate from the meat, giving the Schnitzel its characteristic light and puffy texture. Finally the Schnitzel is fried in [[lard]] or [[clarified butter]] at a temperature of {{convert|160-170|C|F|round=5}} until it is golden yellow. The Schnitzel must swim in the fat or it will not cook evenly: the fat cools too much and intrudes into the bread crumbs, moistening them. During the frying the Schnitzel is repeatedly slightly tossed around the pan. Also during the frying, fat can be scooped from the pan with a spoon and poured onto the meat. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.germanfoodguide.com/schnitzel.cfm |title=Wiener Schnitzel – Tips for Preparing a Wiener Schnitzel |publisher=German Food Guide |access-date=27 March 2014}}</ref>

The dish was traditionally served in Austria with [[Lettuce#Cultivars (varieties)|butterhead lettuce]] tossed with a sweetened [[vinaigrette]] dressing, optionally with chopped chives or onions, [[potato salad]], cucumber salad, or parsley potatoes. In recent times french fries have become common.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=admin |date=2012-10-28 |title=Beilagen - was darf Begleiten? |url=https://www.wiener-schnitzel.at/zubereitung/beilagen/beilagen-was-darf-begleiten/ |access-date=2024-03-21 |website=Wiener Schnitzel |language=de-DE}}</ref>

In the early 20th century, the garnish consisted of capers and [[Anchovies as food|anchovies]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hampel |first1=Friedrich - executive chef of the imperial court|title=Lucullus. Handbuch der Wiener Kochkunst |date=1915 |location=Vienna |chapter=Recipe No. 147}}</ref>

A popular variation is made with [[pork]] instead of veal, because pork is cheaper than veal (usually about half the price). To avoid confusion, Austrian law requires that {{lang|de|Wiener Schnitzel}} be made of veal.<ref name="define">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20190805-does-this-schnitzel-define-vienna |title=Does this schnitzel define Vienna? |first=Anna |last=Muckerman |date=6 August 2019 |work=BBC Travel}}</ref> A schnitzel made of pork can be called {{lang|de|Wiener Schnitzel vom Schwein}}<ref name="define"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.topnews.de/urteil-schweineschnitzel-darf-weiterhin-wiener-schnitzel-vom-schwein-heissen-378926 |title=Urteil: Schweineschnitzel darf weiterhin "Wiener Schnitzel vom Schwein" heißen |date=10 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190917112212/http://www.topnews.de/urteil-schweineschnitzel-darf-weiterhin-wiener-schnitzel-vom-schwein-heissen-378926 |archive-date=2019-09-17}}</ref> ('Wiener schnitzel from pork') or {{lang|de|Schnitzel Wiener Art}} ('Viennese style schnitzel').

[[Tonkatsu]] is a similar fried pork cutlet from [[Japanese cuisine]], thicker than its European counterparts.

In the [[Southern Cone]], particularly in [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]], a similar dish is [[milanesa]]. It is often served with french fries or mashed potatoes.

In [[Israel]], schnitzel is popular, first introduced by European Jews who immigrated to Israel during the middle decades of the twentieth century. Owing to food shortages at that time and the high cost of meat and veal, and due to [[kashrut]] laws that forbid eating pork, the local version was made of chicken breast, which was less expensive. Israeli schnitzel is still made of chicken.<ref name="VG">{{cite news |last1=Guttman |first1=Vered |title=How to Make Schnitzel Like an Israeli |url=https://www.haaretz.com/food/how-to-make-schnitzel-like-an-israeli-1.5492263 |access-date=4 January 2020 |publisher=Haaretz |date=30 January 2017}}</ref> Kashrut laws also [[Milk and meat in Jewish law|forbid using dairy products with meat]], so kosher schnitzel is prepared with [[cooking oil]].
