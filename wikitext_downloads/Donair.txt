{{Canadian cuisine}}

The '''donair''' is a variation of the [[döner kebab]] which originated in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], Canada in the early 1970s. Donair meat is made from spiced ground beef sliced off a rotating cone. The toppings typically include chopped onions and tomatoes, while the distinctive sweet '''donair sauce''' is made from [[condensed milk]], [[sugar]], [[vinegar]], and [[garlic powder]]. All of these ingredients are wrapped together in a soft white pita.<ref name="discover">{{cite web|title=Everything you need to know about Halifax's official food, the donair|url=https://discoverhalifaxns.com/food-drink/everything-you-need-to-know-about-halifaxs-official-food-the-donair/|publisher=Discover Halifax|accessdate=2024-06-07}}</ref><ref name="sauce">{{cite web|title=Andy's East Coast Kitchen - Donair Sauce|url=https://theeastcoastkitchen.com/donair-sauce/|accessdate=2024-11-07}}</ref>

== History ==
Originating from traditional Turkish ''doner'', the Halifax donair was created in the 1970s by Greek immigrant Peter Gamoulakos. Initially offering traditional gyros at Velos Pizza in [[Bedford, Nova Scotia]], Gamoulakos modified the recipe to better suit local tastes. He replaced [[mutton|lamb]] with [[beef]] and developed a sweet sauce made from evaporated milk, vinegar, and garlic powder.<ref>{{cite web|title=Iconic Canadian Food: The History of the Halifax Donair|url=https://www.foodbloggersofcanada.com/history-of-the-halifax-donair/|publisher=Food Bloggers of Canada|accessdate=2024-06-07|first=Gabby | last=Peyton}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Donair: The Halifax Origination Story|url=https://www.eatthistown.ca/history-of-the-donair-the-halifax-origination-story/|publisher=Eat This Town|accessdate=2024-06-07}}</ref><ref name="foodnetworkcanada">{{cite web|title=The Delicious History of the Halifax Donair|url=https://www.foodnetwork.ca/article/the-delicious-history-of-the-halifax-donair/|publisher=Food Network Canada|accessdate=2024-06-07|archive-date=2024-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240614211210/https://www.foodnetwork.ca/article/the-delicious-history-of-the-halifax-donair/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Development ==
Donairs have their origins in Turkey, traditionally known as ''döner'', ''gyros'', or ''döner kebab''. The modern fast food doner was reportedly invented by [[Mahmut Aygun]], a Turkish immigrant in Berlin, in 1971.{{Citation needed|reason=It was alreasy invented in Bursa, in 1850s|date=June 2025}} Velos Pizza in Bedford, Nova Scotia, is credited with creating the "Halifax" donair around 1971-1973, featuring a very sweet sauce made from condensed milk, sugar, garlic, and vinegar.<ref>{{cite web|title=Donair History|url=http://donair.org/content/donair-history|publisher=Donair.org|accessdate=2024-06-07}}</ref><ref name="discover"/> 

In 1973, Gamoulakos opened the [[King of Donair]] restaurant on Quinpool Road in Halifax, where the donair recipe was developed further. The dish quickly gained popularity, becoming a staple of late-night dining. The classic donair consists of spiced ground beef cooked on a rotating spit, served in a pita with tomatoes, onions, and the signature sweet sauce.<ref name="foodnetworkcanada"/><ref name="cbc">{{cite news|title=Halifax declares donairs the official food of the city|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/halifax-donair-official-food-1.3355840|publisher=CBC News|date=2015-12-08|accessdate=2024-06-07}}</ref>

== Expansion and recognition ==
Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, the donair continued to grow in popularity. In 2015, Halifax officially recognized the donair as the city's official food. The motion, which saw an equal split among councillors, was decided by Mayor [[Mike Savage (politician)|Mike Savage]], who cast the deciding vote to elevate the donair to its official status.<ref name="cbc"/><ref>{{cite web|title=How the donair became the official food of Halifax|url=https://www.cbc.ca/radio/secretlifeofcanada/how-the-donair-became-the-official-food-of-halifax-1.6487092|publisher=CBC|accessdate=2024-06-07}}</ref>

== Cultural influence ==
The donair's influence extends beyond Halifax, with its presence in other Canadian cities and endorsements from notable figures like [[Anthony Bourdain]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Donair, a Haligonian Delicacy for 52 Years|url=https://atlanticbusinessmagazine.ca/web-exclusives/the-donair-a-haligonian-delicacy-for-52-years/|publisher=Atlantic Business Magazine|date=2023-07-21|accessdate=2024-06-07}}</ref><ref name="foodnetworkcanada"/>

== Regional variations and current status ==
The Halifax donair has inspired numerous regional variations across Canada. In [[New Brunswick]], donairs include lettuce, while in [[Alberta]], variations include cheese and pepperoni. Despite these adaptations, the authentic donair remains a Nova Scotian specialty, and its popularity continues to grow. Today, Tony's Meats, which acquired the Mr. Donair brand, continues to expand its reach, offering a range of donair-related products across Canada and recently into the U.S.<ref name="discover"/><ref name="edmontonjournal">{{cite news|title=Donairs explained: How a humble street food conquered Edmonton|url=https://edmontonjournal.com/life/food/donairs-explained-how-humble-street-food-conquered-edmonton|publisher=Edmonton Journal|date=2020-09-25|accessdate=2024-06-07}}</ref>

=== Edmonton ===
[[Edmonton]] has embraced the donair, with nearly 120 shops featuring donairs in their names. The city's [[Lebanese Canadians|Lebanese community]] played a significant role in popularizing donairs in Edmonton. Notable establishments like Athena Donair contributed to its local fame. Unlike Halifax, Edmonton donairs often include variations like lettuce, [[Tzatziki|tzatziki sauce]], and unique flavors such as barbecue and pineapple curry.<ref name="edmontonjournal"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Halifax's donair: The tastiest treat you have probably never heard of|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/food-and-wine/food-trends/halifaxs-donair-the-tastiest-treat-you-have-probably-never-heard-of/article4257639/|publisher=Globe and Mail|accessdate=2024-06-07}}</ref> Recently, Prime Time Donair made headlines by winning an auction for a donair costume, paying $16,025 to keep the Alberta-made costume within the province.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tasty auction tale ends as Edmonton-based restaurant chain buys Alberta donair costume|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/edmonton/article/tasty-auction-tale-ends-as-edmonton-based-restaurant-chain-buys-alberta-donair-costume/|publisher=CTV News|date=2023-08-14|access-date=2024-06-07}}</ref>
