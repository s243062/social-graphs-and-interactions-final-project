[[File:Bandeja paisa 30062011.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Bandeja paisa from Peñól de Guatapé in [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]], [[Colombia]] ]]
'''Bandeja paisa''' ({{IPA|es|banˌdexa ˈpai̯sa}}; {{lit|Paisa platter}}), with variations known as '''bandeja de [[arriero]]''', '''bandeja montañera''', and '''bandeja antioqueña''', is one of the most representative meals in [[Colombian cuisine]], especially of the [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] department and the [[Paisa region]], as well as with the [[Colombian Coffee-Growers Axis]] (the departments of [[Caldas Department|Caldas]], [[Quindío Department|Quindío]] and [[Risaralda Department|Risaralda]], [[Tolima department|Tolima]] and [[Valle del Cauca Department|Valle del Cauca]]). {{lang|es|Paisa}} refers to a person from the [[Paisa region]] and {{lang|es|bandeja}} is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for ''[[platter (dishware)|platter]]''.

The main characteristic of this dish is the generous amount and variety of food in a traditional bandeja paisa: [[Kidney bean|red beans]] cooked with [[pork]], white [[rice]], carne molida ([[ground meat]]), [[chicharrón]], [[fried egg]], [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]] (plátano maduro), [[chorizo]], [[arepa]], [[hogao]] sauce, [[black pudding]] ([[morcilla]]), [[avocado]] and [[lemon]].<ref>[http://www.viviendocali.com/receta-bandeja-paisa/ Ingredientes Bandeja Paisa (spanish)]</ref>
It is served in a platter or a [[tray]].<ref>[http://www.monografias.com/trabajos11/banpa/banpa.shtml Artes y saberes de la bandeja paisa]</ref>

== Origin ==
The origin of the bandeja paisa was [[Columbian exchange|influenced by several different cultures]] that inhabited Colombia throughout the centuries, including the [[indigenous peoples of Colombia]], as well as [[Colony|colonial]] Spaniards and [[Ethnic groups of Africa|Africans]]. In the 19th century, French and British colonialists also brought their cuisine with them.<ref>(Spanish)http://www.historiacocina.com/paises/articulos/gastrocolombia.htm</ref>

The current form and presentation of the Paisa platter is relatively recent.  There are no references in the [[food writing]] about this dish before 1950. It is probably an interpretation of the local restaurants of simpler peasant dishes. One of its most prominent features is the juxtaposition of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native American]] and European ingredients, which is also observed in other [[mestizo]] dishes of [[Latin American]] cuisine, such as [[Venezuela]]n [[pabellón criollo]] or [[Costa Rica]]n [[gallo pinto]].

== Presentation and variations ==
A Paisa platter is traditionally served in a large, oval-shaped tray due to the large amount of food that is served. [[Side dish]]es include [[mazamorra]] (a [[maize]]-derived beverage similar to [[atole]]) with [[milk]] and ground [[panela]].

There are several variants of the dish all over the country with deletion or addition of ingredients, which cannot be recognized as bandeja paisa in the strictest sense.  Some [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]]n restaurants offer an "extended" bandeja paisa, also known as "seven meats platter", which contains, besides the aforementioned ingredients, grilled [[steak]], grilled [[pork]] and [[liver]]. A [[dieting|diet-]]friendly version of the dish is very popular in [[Bogotá]], which replaces pork with grilled [[chicken breast]], skips black pudding and chorizo or replaces it with a [[Vienna sausage|wiener]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saludcolombia.com/actual/salud60/colabora.htm |title=Colaboradores |publisher=Saludcolombia.com |access-date=2016-10-06}}</ref>

== Colombian national dish ==

In 2005, the Colombian government planned to make bandeja paisa the [[national dish]], with the name to be changed to ''bandeja montañera'' ("mountain tray") to avoid the exclusion of people from outside the Paisa region. A number of people opposed this designation, arguing that only a small percentage of the Colombian population consumes it on a regular basis and that it originated in only a single region of Colombia (Antioquia).<ref>{{cite web | url=https://revistadiners.com.co/gastronomia/51273_es-la-bandeja-paisa-el-plato-nacional/ | title=¿Es la bandeja paisa el plato nacional? | date=14 November 2017 | publisher=RevistaDiners.com.co | access-date=2018-05-10}}</ref> However, the suggested alternative, [[sancocho]], is not a distinctively Colombian dish, as it is known and enjoyed in many other countries, such as [[Cuba]], [[Venezuela]], the [[Canary Islands]], [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Panama]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lasillaelectrica.com/foroelectrico/index.php?PHPSESSID=2f6d50ae06705fb017dacecdb378a6fd&topic=1497.0 |title=En Busca de Un Plato Nacional |access-date=2009-09-29 |archive-date=2007-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928010117/http://www.lasillaelectrica.com/foroelectrico/index.php?PHPSESSID=2f6d50ae06705fb017dacecdb378a6fd&topic=1497.0 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Due to the international ubiquity of sancocho, Colombian [[ajiaco]] is often considered the most definitive Colombian dish instead.

Nonetheless, the commercial Colombian tourism industry has pushed ahead without official government sanction by emblazoning ads, menus, and brochure information with imagery of the bandeja paisa as the single most typical Colombian dish.<ref>(Spanish) {{cite web|url=http://www.lapatria.com/Noticias/ver_noticia.aspx?CODNOT=22144&CODSEC=22 |title=Ver_noticia |access-date=2007-10-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221015610/http://www.lapatria.com/Noticias/ver_noticia.aspx?CODNOT=22144&CODSEC=22 |archive-date=2007-12-21 }}</ref>
