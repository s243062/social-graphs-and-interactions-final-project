'''Taiwanese beef noodle soup''' ({{zh|t=臺灣牛肉麵}}) is a [[beef noodle soup]] dish that originated in [[Taiwan]]. It is sometimes referred to as "Sichuanese beef noodle soup" ({{zh|t=四川牛肉麵}}) in Taiwan, although this usage can create confusion as [[Sichuan]] has its own versions of beef noodle soups,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lin|first=Florence|title=Florence Lin's Complete book of Chinese noodles, dumplings and breads|date=1986|others=Peter LaVigna|isbn=0-688-03796-8|edition=|location=New York|pages=43|oclc=12978274}}</ref> which may be sold at Sichuanese restaurants under the same name.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-01-27|title=Sichuan noodles at sixty-one SFBA Sichuan restaurants|url=https://www.hungryonion.org/t/sichuan-noodles-at-sixty-one-sfba-sichuan-restaurants/8120|access-date=2021-07-02|website=Hungry Onion|language=en-US}}</ref> The beef is often stewed with the broth and simmered, sometimes for hours. Chefs also let the stock simmer for long periods with bone marrow; some vendors can cook the beef stock for over 24 hours. In [[Taiwan]], beef noodle vendors may also have optional, often cold side dishes, such as braised dried tofu, seaweed or pork intestine. Beef noodles are often served with [[suan cai]] (Chinese pickled cabbage or mustard) on top, green onion and sometimes other vegetables in the soup as well.<ref>{{cite web|title=Taipei Beef Noodle Festival: Beef Noodle Tasting|url=http://www.tbnf.com.tw/en/m_know.htm#k3|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517013532/http://www.tbnf.com.tw/en/m_know.htm#k3|archive-date=17 May 2011|access-date=6 December 2013|work=tbnf.com.tw|publisher=Taipei Beef Noodle Festival}}</ref>

The dish was created in Taiwan by [[Kuomintang]] veterans from [[Sichuan province]] who fled from mainland China to [[Kaohsiung]], Taiwan, and served the dish in [[military dependents' villages]].<ref>{{cite web|script-title=zh:四川」牛肉麵其實源自台灣？一窺牛肉麵的背後故事|url=http://food.ltn.com.tw/article/2347|website=Liberty Times Net|date=9 October 2017|publisher=Liberty Times|access-date=26 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=焦|first1=桐|script-title=zh:一碗紅燒牛肉麵，喚醒許多人共同的歷史記憶|url=https://gvlf.gvm.com.tw/article_content_12306.html|script-website=zh:遠見華人 精英論壇|access-date=26 September 2018}}</ref> The Taiwanese traditionally had an aversion to the consumption of beef even into the mid-1970s because cattle were valuable [[Working animal|beasts of burden]], so originally the dish was only eaten by [[waishengren]]. However, the dish became more accepted over time and is now one of the most famous dishes in [[Taiwanese cuisine]]. It is believed that the popularity of this noodle soup broke the beef-eating taboo and also paved the way to Taiwan's acceptance of American foods that utilized beef (such as hamburgers). The Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup is significantly less spicy than Sichuan flavors, and there are several variations with the soy-based broth, such as tomato, garlic and herbal medicine. The tomato variation ({{lang|zh-hant|番茄牛肉麵}}) is popular in Taiwan and features chunks of tomatoes in a rich red-coloured tomato broth with or without soy sauce.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lu|first=Yaodong|title=What is Beef Noodle: Interview: Professor Lu, Yaodong, Expert in history of food and beverage|url=http://www.tbnf.com.tw/en/m_know.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517013532/http://www.tbnf.com.tw/en/m_know.htm|archive-date=17 May 2011|access-date=6 December 2013|work=tbnf.com.tw|publisher=Taipei Beef Noodle Festival}}</ref> The herbal medicine variation is usually served without suan cai as a topping (as its acidic properties are believed to exhibit medicinal properties) and may be accompanied by a chili paste made from beef lard.{{Cn|date=July 2021}}

Taiwanese beef noodle soups are sometimes served as fast food in both Taiwan and mainland China. In China, [[Mr. Lee (restaurant)|Mr. Lee]] is the largest chain, featuring the dish "California Beef Noodle Soup".  In Taiwan, Mercuries Beef Noodle (''sān shāng qiǎo fú'', see [[:zh:三商巧福]]) is the largest beef noodle fast food franchise, owned by a subsidiary of Mercuries & Associates Holdings ([[:zh:三商企業]]). It is sometimes considered a [[national dish]] in Taiwan, and every year [[Taipei]] holds an annual Beef Noodle Festival, where various chefs and restaurants compete for the title of the "best beef noodles in Taiwan".<ref>{{cite web|title=Food Lovers Flock to Taipei Beef Noodle Festival|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201311090016.aspx|access-date=6 December 2013|work=Focustaiwan.tw|date=9 November 2013 |publisher=Focus Taiwan News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=2013 Taipei International Beef Noodle Festival|url=http://www.taipei.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=65197970&ctNode=8557&mp=100002|access-date=6 December 2013|work=taipei.gov|publisher=Taipei City Government}}</ref> Due to influences from the influx of immigrants from mainland China in the early 1900s, the Taiwanese version of beef noodle soup is now one of the most popular dishes in Taiwan.<ref name="goossaert2">{{cite book|last=Goossaert|first=Vincent|url=https://archive.org/details/religiousquestio0000goos|title=The Religious Question in Modern China|author2=David A.
