{{nihongo|'''Sashimi'''|刺身||4={{IPAc-en|lang|s|ə|ˈ|ʃ|iː|m|i}} {{respell|sə|SHEE|mee}}, {{IPA|ja|saɕimiꜜ|lang}}}} is a [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese delicacy]] consisting of fresh [[raw fish]] or [[Raw meat|meat]] sliced into thin pieces and often eaten with [[soy sauce]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/sashimi |title=sashimi Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary |website=dictionary.cambridge.org  |access-date=20 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820105620/https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/sashimi |archive-date=20 August 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>

== Origin ==
[[File:Sashimi.jpg|thumb|Assorted ''sashimi'': [[Tuna as food|tuna]], [[cuttlefish]], and [[seabream]]]]
The word ''sashimi'' means 'pierced body', i.e., "[[wikt:刺身|刺身]]" = ''sashimi'', where [[wikt:刺|刺]] [[wikt:し|し]] = ''sashi'' (pierced, stuck) and [[wikt:身|身]] = ''mi'' (body, meat). This word dates from the [[Muromachi period]] (1336–1573){{citation needed|date=November 2024}} and there are multiple theories as to its etymology:

The term was possibly coined when the word "[[wikt:切る|切る]]" = ''kiru'' (cut), the culinary step, was considered too inauspicious to be used by anyone other than a [[samurai]]. This word may derive from the culinary practice of sticking the fish's tail and fin to the slices for the purpose of identifying the fish being eaten.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}

Another possibility for the name is the traditional method of harvesting. "''Sashimi''-grade" fish is caught by individual handline. As soon as the fish is landed, its brain is pierced with a sharp spike, and it is placed in slurried ice. This spiking is called the [[ikejime]] process, and the instant death means that the fish's flesh contains a minimal amount of [[lactic acid]]. This means that the fish will keep fresh on ice for longer without turning white or otherwise degrading.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Totos |date=2012-12-04 |title=Ike Jime Part 2 – What “closing” does to the fish? {{!}} Japanese Anglers Secrets |url=https://anglers-secrets.com/what-closing-does-to-the-fish/ |access-date=2025-10-30 |language=en-US}}</ref>

Many non-Japanese use the terms ''sashimi'' and ''[[sushi]]'' interchangeably, but the two dishes are distinct and separate. Sushi refers to any dish made with vinegared rice. While raw fish is one traditional sushi ingredient, many sushi dishes contain seafood that has been cooked, and others have no seafood at all, including ingredients like seaweed, vegetables, omelets, and fried tofu.<ref name="RD">{{cite magazine |last1=Phillips |first1=Hedy |date=18 February 2022 |title=What Is Sashimi, Exactly? |url=https://www.rd.com/article/what-is-sashimi/ |magazine=[[Reader's Digest]] |access-date=4 December 2022}}</ref> ''Sashimi,'' by contrast, is always served on its own.<ref name="pogogi">{{cite web |title=What is the difference between Sushi vs Sashimi |url=https://pogogi.com/what-difference-between-sushi-vs-sashimi |website=Pogogi |access-date=17 May 2019 |language=en |date=20 February 2014}}</ref> Although Japan has long had the custom of eating fish raw, the idea of serving it as a beautifully arranged dish is thought to have come from China, probably around the [[Kamakura period]] (1185&ndash;1333). An early cookbook in Japanese, written in 1489, directs that the raw flesh should be sliced and mixed with vinegar and seasonings such as salt and herbs.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Gordenker |first=Alice |date=20 November 2022 |title=Your Informed Guide to Sashimi Garnishes: What are they and should you eat them? |url=https://www.japanesefoodguide.com/sashimi-garnishes-tsuma/ |access-date=27 November 2022 |language=en-US}}</ref>

An early western description of sashimi comes from a letter written by the future [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]], [[Sir Arthur Wilson, 3rd Baronet|Sir Arthur Wilson]] of the [[Royal Navy]], who was assigned to the British naval mission to Japan in the late 1860s: "It is a peculiar sort of fish, which they cut in very thin slices and serve up with some sort of sauce over it. It is considered a great delicacy. I have tried it and did not find it bad, but the idea is not nice."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bradford |first=Sir Edward Eden |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XNNpAAAAMAAJ&dq=Life+of+Admiral+of+the+Fleet+Sir+Arthur+Knyvet+Wilson,+Bart.,+V.C.,+G.C.B.,+O.M.,+G.C.V.O.&pg=PA26 |title=Life of Admiral of the Fleet Sir Arthur Knyvet Wilson, Bart., V.C., G.C.B., O.M., G.C.V.O. |date=1923 |publisher=J.

''Sashimi'' is often served early in a formal Japanese meal but it can also be served in a sashimi set meal, presented with [[rice]] and [[miso soup]] in separate bowls. Japanese chefs consider ''sashimi'' the finest dish in Japanese formal dining and recommend that it be eaten before other strong flavors affect the [[palate]].<ref name="Tsuji">{{cite book |last1=Tsuji |first1=Shizuo |last2=Fisher |first2=M.F.K. |last3=Reichi |first3=Ruth |title=Japanese Cooking: A Simple Art |edition=25th Anniversary |date=17 February 2007 |publisher=Kodansha USA |isbn=978-4-7700-3049-8 |pages=158–60}}</ref>

The sliced seafood that composes the main ingredient is typically draped over a garnish. The typical garnish is Asian white radish, ''[[daikon]]'', shredded into long thin strands, or single leaves of the herb ''[[shiso]]'' ([[Perilla frutescens var. crispa|perilla]]).<ref name="Tsuji" /> Garnishes for sashimi are generally called ''tsuma'' and may also include slices of other raw vegetables, such as cucumbers and carrots, as well as seaweeds, flowers and leaves and stems of other plants.<ref name=":0" />

''Sashimi'' is popularly served with a dipping sauce ([[soy sauce]]) and condiments such as [[wasabi]] paste, grated fresh [[ginger]],<ref name="Tsuji" /> ''[[gari (ginger)|gari]]'' or pickled ginger,<ref name="RD"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://japandeluxetours.com/experiences/wasabi |title=Wasabi |publisher=Japan Deluxe Tours |access-date=30 May 2017}}</ref> grated fresh [[garlic]], or [[ponzu]] for meat ''sashimi'', and such garnishes as shiso and shredded daikon radish.
Wasabi paste is sometimes mixed directly into soy sauce as a dipping sauce, which is generally not done when eating [[sushi]] (which itself normally includes ''wasabi''). A reputed motivation for serving wasabi with ''sashimi'' and also ''gari'', besides its flavor, is killing harmful bacteria and parasites that could be present in raw seafood.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sushifaq.com/sushi-items/sushi-items-wasabi.htm |title=Sushi Items – Wasabi |publisher=The Sushi FAQ |access-date=12 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806033433/http://www.sushifaq.com/sushi-items/sushi-items-wasabi.htm |archive-date=6 August 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Food cut into small pieces and eaten with wasabi and soy sauce may be called sashimi in Japan, including the following ingredients. Like bamboo shoots, the food is enjoyed raw to appreciate the freshness, and producers and farmers offer those sashimi at their properties in top season. Some of the vegetables are enjoyed as thin sliced strips and called sashimi while they resemble fish meat, like avocado as salmon and konnyaku as puffer fish.

Less common, but not unusual, sashimi ingredients are vegetarian items, such as [[Yuba (food)|yuba]] (bean curd skin), and raw red meats, such as [[beef]] (known as ''gyuunotataki'') or [[horse meat|horse]] (known as ''basashi'').<ref name="Mouritsen 2009 p. 296">{{cite book | last=Mouritsen | first=O.G. | title=Sushi: Food for the Eye, the Body and the Soul | publisher=Springer | year=2009 | isbn=978-1-4419-0618-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RJxuV-0eT4UC&pg=PA296 | access-date=13 May 2019 | page=296 | quote= basashi – sashimi made from raw horse (uma).}}</ref> [[chicken (food)|Chicken]] "sashimi" (known as ''toriwasa'') is considered by some {{who|date=January 2014}} to be a delicacy; the [[Nagoya#Cuisine|Nagoya]] [[Cochin (chicken)|kōchin]], [[France|French]] ''[[Bresse (chicken)|poulet de Bresse]]'' and its American derivative, the [[blue foot chicken]], are favored by many for this purpose, as, besides their taste, they are certified to be free of ''[[Salmonella]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Chicken sashimi is sometimes slightly braised or seared on the outside.<ref name="chicken" />

== Safety ==
As a [[Raw foodism|raw food]], consuming sashimi can result in [[foodborne illness]] when bacteria or parasites are present; for example, [[anisakis|anisakiasis]] is a disease caused by the accidental ingestion of larval [[nematode]]s in the family [[Anisakidae]], primarily ''[[Anisakis]] simplex''  but also ''Pseudoterranova decipiens''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FoodborneIllness/FoodborneIllnessFoodbornePathogensNaturalToxins/BadBugBook/ucm070768.htm |title=BBB – Anisakis simplex and related |publisher=Fda.gov |date=2 February 2009 |access-date=12 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625213139/https://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FoodborneIllness/FoodborneIllnessFoodbornePathogensNaturalToxins/BadBugBook/ucm070768.htm |archive-date=25 June 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In addition, incorrectly prepared [[fugu]] fish may contain [[tetrodotoxin]], a potent neurotoxin.

Another type of foodborne illness that could occur after consuming tainted sashimi is [[diphyllobothriasis]]. This disease is an infection within the intestines that occurs when the tapeworm ''[[Diphyllobothrium latum]]'' is consumed. Common fish such as trout, salmon, pike, and sea bass harbor this parasitic larva in their muscles. Since the innovation of the chilled transport system paired with the salmon and trout consumption, an increasing number of cases have been recorded annually in northern Japan due to the spread of this disease.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Sushi Delights and Parasites: The Risk of Fishborne and Foodborne Parasitic Zoonoses in Asia |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=41 |issue=9 |pages=1297–1303 |first1=Yukifumi |last1=Nawa |first2=Christoph |last2=Hatz |first3=Johannes |last3=Blum |doi=10.1086/496920 |pmid=16206105 |year=2005 |doi-access=free |url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/294175/files/41-9-1297.pdf }}</ref>

Traditionally, fish that spend at least part of their lives in [[brackish]] or fresh water were considered unsuitable for sashimi because of the possibility of parasites.

With the constant amount of fishing, bluefin tuna population rates have been steadily declining. A proposed solution has been farming bluefin tuna in fisheries. Historically, this has posed a problem in that the captive fish are not raised from spawn, but rather from small wild fish that are netted and transported to the farms, mostly in the Mediterranean.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/17/opinion/17sat2.html |title=The Bluefin Slaughter |department=The Opinion Pages/Editorial |work=[[The New York Times]] | page=A18 |date=17 November 2007 |access-date=12 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150605053330/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/17/opinion/17sat2.html |archive-date=5 June 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> However, Japanese scientists have found a way to successfully breed and raise the fish entirely in captivity.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-04-08/bluefin-tuna-farming-japan/6373310 |title=Japanese scientists breed first captive bluefin tuna in fight for sustainable fisheries |department=North Asia |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] | date=7 April 2015 |access-date=28 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602112354/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-04-08/bluefin-tuna-farming-japan/6373310 |archive-date=2 June 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>
