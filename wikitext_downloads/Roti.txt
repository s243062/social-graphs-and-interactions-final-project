'''Roti''' is a round [[flatbread]] originating from the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It is commonly consumed in many [[South Asian]], [[Southeast Asia]]n, [[Caribbean]], [[East Africa]]n, and [[Southeast Africa]]n countries.

===Caribbean===
Roti is eaten widely across the [[Caribbean]], especially in countries with large [[Indo-Caribbean]] populations such as [[Trinidad and Tobago]],  [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], and [[Jamaica]]. Originally brought to the islands by [[Indentured servitude|indentured laborers]] from the Indian subcontinent, roti has become a popular staple in the culturally rich cuisines of these countries. In the Caribbean, roti is commonly eaten as an accompaniment to various curries and stews. The traditional way of eating roti is to break the roti by hand, using it to sop up sauce and pieces of meat from the curry. However, in the Caribbean, the term roti may refer to both the flatbread (roti) itself and the more popular [[street food]] item, in which the roti is folded around a savory filling in the form of a wrap.

The [[Wrap roti|roti wrap]] is the commercialization of roti and curry together as a fast-food or street-food item in the Caribbean. This wrap form of roti originated in southern Trinidad. It was first created in the mid-1940s by Sackina Karamath, who later founded Hummingbird Roti Shop in [[San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago]]. The wrap was convenient, as the meal could be eaten faster and while on the go, as well as keeping one's hands from getting dirty. In Trinidad and Tobago, various wrapped roti are served, including chicken, conch, goat, beef, and shrimp. Vegetables can also be added including potato, pumpkin, and spinach as well a variety of local condiments, with pepper sauce (hot sauce) and mango [[chutney]] being the most popular. The roti wrap quickly gained popularity across the island and spread throughout the rest of the Caribbean.  The wrap is now simply referred to as a roti or just roti.  The growth in popularity has recently led to referring to the flatbread itself (roti) that surrounds the filling as a "roti skin" or "roti shell", a practice that is now common in both restaurants and commercial companies. Various types of roti are eaten throughout the West Indies. They are most prominently featured in the diets of people in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, and Suriname. Caribbean-style roti is primarily made from wheat flour, baking powder, salt, and water, and cooked on a ''tawa''. Certain rotis are also made with [[ghee]] or [[butter]].

|Sada roti
|
|This is a plain roti, made of white flour. It is the simplest roti to make, and is the most commonly consumed roti in Trinidad. It is a popular breakfast option there,<ref>{{cite book | last=Mason | first=T. | title=Caribbean Vegan: Meat-free, Egg-free, Dairy-free Authentic Island Cuisine for Every Occasion | publisher=The Experiment | year=2016 | isbn=978-1-61519-360-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FDZgDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA67 | access-date=9 February 2018 | page=67}}</ref> and is enjoyed in combination with various curried meat and vegetable dishes. This type of roti is a staple food consumed for both breakfast and dinner by Trinidadians.
|-
|[[Paratha]] roti
|[[File:Roti Style Paratha.jpg|145px]]
|A layered roti made with butter, usually ghee (clarified butter), but any butter can be used.<ref name="Albala 2011">{{cite book | last=Albala | first=K. | title=Food Cultures of the World Encyclopedia &#91;4 volumes&#93;: &#91;Four Volumes&#93; | publisher=ABC-CLIO | year=2011 | isbn=978-0-313-37627-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zG1H75z0EYYC&pg=RA1-PA298 | access-date=9 February 2018 | page=298}}</ref> Ghee is rubbed on both sides, then it is cooked on a ''tawa'' (a round, flat metal griddle used in Indian and Pakistani cooking). This gives the roti a crisp outside and small patches of light browning. When the roti is almost finished cooking, the cook begins to beat the roti while it is on the tawa, causing it to become light and flaky. ''Paratha roti'' is more rich and flavorful than plain roti. ''Paratha'' is enjoyed with almost any accompaniment. As with other rotis, it is commonly eaten with curries and stews. It is also traditionally eaten with fried eggs or egg dishes and a cup of tea. In Trinidad, ''parathas'' are colloquially called "buss-up shut" ("busted-up shirt") because the roti resembles a tattered and torn-up shirt.
|-
|[[Puri (food)|Puri]]
|[[File:Poori.jpg|145px]]
|This is a roti where two layers are rolled out together and cooked (after rolled it's fried directly in hot oil. Some like to first half-cook it on a tawa and then fry (because the puri then soaks up less oil) in the ''[[kadhai]]''.

The cumin is toasted until black and also ground. The stuffing is pushed into the roti dough, and sealed. When rolled flat, the filling is distributed within the roti. It is cooked on the ''tava'' and rubbed with oil for ease of cooking. This type of roti is most commonly eaten with a variety of curries. It is also the roti of choice for the making of wrap rotis.

|A popular wrap made by folding a combination of meat and vegetable curries inside of a dhalpuri roti: The curry or stew often contains potatoes or chickpeas as a filler as well as the essential meat component, although vegetarian options are common as well. Popular fillings include curried chicken, goat, conch, duck, beef, shrimp, and vegetable. An assortment of optional condiments are also common such as pepper sauce and mango chutney.

|A roti similar to a ''dhalpuri'', but with ''aloo'' (potato) substituted for the ''dhal''. The ''aloo'' is boiled and milled, and spices and seasonings are added before being sealed in the dough. This ''aloo'' filling is also used when making ''aloo'' pie or ''aloo choka''.

====Guyana====
[[Image:GuyaneseRoti.JPG|thumb|Guyanese roti, clapped and ready to be eaten]]

''Dosti roti'' is common in Guyana.{{efn|"... most Guyanese are unaware that there are different types of roti, which is the staple food in the diet of Indo-Guyanese. ROTI Table 1 shows the differences between eight different types of roti as used by Indo-Guyanese: paratha, dosti, cassava, daalpuri, aluu, chotha, puri and sada."<ref>{{cite book | last=Rickford | first=J.R. | title=A Festival of Guyanese Words | publisher=University of Guyana | year=1978 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SdAuAAAAYAAJ | access-date=9 February 2018 | page=127}}</ref>}} A small amount of fat is placed in each piece of dough before it is rolled out to make the roti softer. Usually, [[vegetable oil]] is used, but butter or [[margarine]] can also be used. Ghee is not used in everyday cooking, but is used on special occasions, especially amongst Hindus. The roti is usually clapped by hand or beaten a bit, hot off the ''tava'', so it softens but does not break.
* A good roti in Guyana is very soft, with layers (almost like [[pastry]] layers if possible), which remains whole.
* The type of roti is determined by what is placed in the dough before it is rolled out. Various types include ''dhalpuri'', ''aloo'' (potato) roti, and  sugar.
* In Guyana, a rolled-out, thin, flat dough like a roti that is deep-fried in ghee is called a [[Puri (food)|''puri'']]. Therefore, a ''dhalpuri'' is not really a puri.
* Another item prepared like roti is bake or bakes or floats. A Guyanese or Trinidadian fry bake seems to be more similar to an Indian puri. A bake is made with butter or margarine and has a different ratio of flour to fat. It is made much more quickly than roti and is usually made in the mornings. Dough is rolled out and cut into shapes or rolled into small rounds. Guyanese bakes are fried, but bakes from other parts of the West Indies can be baked in an oven. Bakes are usually paired with a quick [[Full English breakfast|fry-up]] for breakfast or dinner, [[stewing|stewed]] saltfish, or eggs ("western" style, with onions, tomatoes, green peppers). Bakes are also made in other parts of the West Indies, including Trinidad, Barbados, and St. Vincent. In Trinidad and Tobago, a "bake and shark" is a popular street-food sandwich in which fried shark is placed between two halves of a sliced bake with local condiments. Pepper sauce, ''shado beni'', [[garlic sauce]], tamarind, and mango chutney are most common, as well as lettuce, tomato, and cucumber for fillers.

====Suriname====
In Suriname, roti refers mainly to ''dhalpuri'' or ''aloo puri''. It is most often eaten with curried chicken. As in Trinidad and the West Indies, roti can also refer to the stuffed roti wrap. This dish is usually eaten out of hand. Due to a mass emigration of Indian Surinamese in the 1970s, roti became a popular [[take-out]] dish in the Netherlands. It usually includes chicken [[curry]], potatoes, a boiled egg, and various vegetables, most notably the ''kousenband'' or [[yardlong bean]]. Another variation includes shrimp and [[aubergine]]. The meat with gravy, potatoes, egg, and yardlong beans are served side by side on a plate, with the ''aloo puri'' folded in fours on top. <!-- lots of options, why list this?, uncited One then has the option to spice the dish with a very hot chutney made of [[Madame Jeanette]] pepper. -->

In [[Thailand]], โรตี is a popular street food that can be eaten as a dessert or as a side dish. Some Thai curries can also be accompanied with a side of roti, primarily Southern Thai curries.

In [[Cambodia]], រ៉ូទី is a dessert that is sold as street food. It is similar to both a [[crêpe]] and paratha.

===South Africa===
Roti was initially introduced to South Africa by Indian migrants during the 19th century, and subsequently became incorporated into [[Durban]] cuisine. It is widely eaten by the Indian communities living in South Africa, and is either eaten as a flat bread or a wrap with locally made curries.

Roti is also often eaten in Cape Coloured and Cape Malay Communities. Two types of roti are eaten: chapati/flat roti and paratha/flaky roti. Flaky roti is also called Malay roti. When eaten with a curry filling, usually mutton, chicken or mince, the roti is called a Salomie.

Similarly as with other countries that were part of the [[Indian diaspora]], roti was introduced to [[Mauritius]] by [[Mauritians of Indian origin|Indian migrants]]/[[Indian indentured labourers|indentured labourers]] during the 19th century, and has since been a staple of [[Mauritian cuisine]] and a common street food.<ref name=":The rough guide to Mauritius">{{Cite book|title=The rough guide to Mauritius|date=2015|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-0-241-01424-0|oclc=905661042}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mauritian Cuisine|url=http://www.govmu.org/English/ExploreMauritius/Culture/Pages/Culture/Mauritian-Cuisine.aspx|author=Republic of Mauritius|access-date=June 8, 2021}}</ref> Roti generally refers to ''farata'' (a local pronunciation of [[paratha]]), a pancake made of wheat flour and water;<ref name=":The rough guide to Mauritius" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Farata (Traditional Mauritian Name)|url=https://www.exoticholidaymauritius.com/mauritian-cuisinefarata/|author=Exotic Holiday Mauritius|access-date=June 8, 2021|archive-date=8 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210608071832/https://www.exoticholidaymauritius.com/mauritian-cuisinefarata/|url-status=dead}}</ref> other variants include ''dholl puri'', which is layered, and stuffed with boiled and ground [[Dal|dal/split peas]],<ref name=":The rough guide to Mauritius" /><ref>{{cite news |last=Grihault |first=Nicki  |date=2018-01-14 |title=Get stuffed in Mauritius … on dholl puri, the perfect savoury pancake |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/jan/14/mauritius-dholl-puri-savoury-pancakes-street-food-dewa-sons |work=The Guardian |access-date=June 8, 2021}}</ref> and ''ti puri'', a smaller roti that is fried and usually served with seven different curries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ti Puri Sept Cari|url=https://restaurants.mu/en/articles/ti-puri-sept-cari.html|author=Restaurants.mu|access-date=June 8, 2021}}</ref>

===Iran===
In Iran, the two variants of roti are called ''khaboos''<ref>{{cite web|title=Khaboos (Iranian Roti) Recipe|url=http://www.americaindia.com/recipes/showrecipe.php?id=778|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824032317/http://www.americaindia.com/recipes/showrecipe.php?id=778|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 August 2007|access-date=15 July 2012}}</ref>{{better source needed|reason=Any website can claim to be an authority on cooking; there must be more scholarly sources for this.|date=November 2016}} and ''[[lavash]]''.  These two breads (the former of which is almost exactly prepared like Indian roti) are quite similar to other rotis.

===Elsewhere===
Roti shops are now abundant in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Owing to Canada's considerable immigrant populations from both South Asia and the Caribbean, roti and its variants are popular there. As [[Indo-Caribbean people]] moved to North American cities such as Toronto, New York City, [[Miami]], Los Angeles, and Montreal, they exported with them the wrapped version of roti. A distinct [[Toronto]] offering is the "East Indian roti", a variation on the stuffed roti from the [[West Indies]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thespruceeats.com/roti-flatbread-west-indian-style-3028987|title=A Simple Recipe for This Indian-Influenced Roti Flatbread|website=The Spruce Eats}}</ref> In some of these cultures, rotis are also being used in the place of pita bread when making burritos, quesadillas, or any other kinds of wraps.<ref>{{Cite web |title=What Is Roti? |url=https://www.foodnetwork.com/how-to/packages/food-network-essentials/what-is-roti |access-date=2024-04-25 |website=Food Network |language=en}}</ref>
