'''Corn chips''' are a [[snack food]] made from [[cornmeal]] fried in oil or baked, usually in the shape of a small noodle or scoop. Corn chips are thick, rigid, very crunchy, have the strong aroma and flavor of roasted corn, and are often heavily seasoned with [[salt]].

==Overview==
In the [[United States]], [[Fritos]] is one of the oldest and most widely recognized brands of corn chips.<ref name="FritosHistory">

While corn chips and [[tortilla chip]]s are both made from [[maize|corn]], the corn in tortilla chips is subjected to the [[nixtamalization]] process, resulting in a milder flavor and aroma, and a less rigid texture.<ref name="Nixtamalization">{{cite journal |last=Caballero-Briones |first=F. |date=June 2000 |title=Recent advances on the understanding of the ''nixtamalization'' process |journal=Superficies y Vacío |volume=10 |pages=20–24 |publisher=Sociedad Mexicana de Ciencia de Superficies y de Vacío |location=[[Mérida, Yucatán]], Mexico |issn=1665-3521|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Tortilla chips also tend to be larger, thinner, less fatty, and less salty than corn chips. 

Corn chips are usually eaten alone or with a chip [[dip (food)|dip]]. They are a common ingredient in homemade and commercial [[Snack food|party mixes]]. In the Southwestern US, a popular dish, [[Frito pie]], is made with corn chips and [[chili con carne|chili]].<ref name="FritoPie">
