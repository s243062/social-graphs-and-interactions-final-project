'''Peanut stew''' or '''groundnut stew''', also known as '''''maafe''''' ([[Wolof language|Wolof]] ''mafé'', ''maffé'', ''maffe''), and '''''sauce d'arachide''''' (French), is a [[stew]] that is a staple food in [[Western Africa]].<ref name="Collective Scherer 2013 p. 127">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WZM3AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA127|title=Moosewood Restaurant Favorites|last1=Collective|first1=The Moosewood|last2=Scherer|first2=J.|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1-250-00625-7|page=127|access-date=September 9, 2016}}</ref> While maafe is a dish originating from Senegal, in Mali tigadéguéna is also a stew that originated from the [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] and [[Bambara people]] of [[Mali]]<ref>James McCann. Stirring the pot: a history of African cuisine, p132. Ohio University Press, 2009ISBN 0-89680-272-8</ref> and served with Malian [[fufu]] (tuwo). The origins of maafe are mistakenly confused with those of tigadèguèna. Maafe is a dish from the colonial era that consisted of rice, among other things, and was not known in Mali before it was imported into Senegal. The concept of peanuts was also unknown in Mali but [[Bambara groundnuts]].{{clarify|date=June 2025}} 

The proper name for it in the [[Mandinka language]] is {{lang|mnk|domodah|italic=yes}} or {{lang|mnk|tigadegena|italic=yes}} (lit. 'peanut butter sauce,' where ''tige'' is 'peanut,' ''dege'' is 'paste,' and ''na'' is 'sauce') in Bamanankan.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Hirshon Malian Peanut Stew – Tigadegena|url=https://www.thefooddictator.com/hirshon-malian-peanut-stew-tigadegena/|date=2016-09-22|website=✮ The Food Dictator ✮|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-29}}</ref>

Variants of Senegalese maafe appear in the cuisine of nations throughout [[West Africa]] and [[Central Africa]]. It is very similar to [[groundnut soup]].

==Variations==
[[File:Mafé Sénégalais.jpg|alt=Senegalese maafe with vegetables|thumb|Senegalese maafe with vegetables]]
Recipes for the stew vary widely, but commonly include [[chicken (food)|chicken]], [[tomato]], [[onion]], [[garlic]], [[cabbage]], and [[leaf vegetable|leaf]] or [[root vegetable]]s. Other versions include [[okra]], [[maize|corn]], [[carrot]]s, [[cinnamon]], [[Chili pepper|hot peppers]], [[paprika]], [[black pepper]], [[turmeric]], [[cumin]], and other [[spices]]. Maafe is traditionally served with white [[rice]] (in [[Senegal]], [[Mauritania]], [[Guinea-Bissau]] and [[Gambia]]), ''fonio'' or ''to'' ([[millet]] dough) in [[Mali]], ''tuwo'' or ''omo tuo'' ([[rice]] or millet dough) in Northern [[Nigeria]], [[Niger]], and Northern [[Ghana]], [[couscous]] (as West Africa meets the Sahara, in Sahelian countries), or [[fufu]] and [[sweet potato]]es in the more tropical areas, such as the Ivory Coast. ''Um'bido'' is a variation using greens, while [[Ghana]]ian maafe is cooked with boiled eggs.<ref>[http://www.yumyum.com/recipe.htm?ID=21716 Um'bido (greens & Peanuts) Recipe] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303170443/http://www.yumyum.com/recipe.htm?ID=21716 |date=2016-03-03 }}<br />Ghanaian Maafe: My Changing Memories of Mafe</ref>  "Virginia peanut soup", a variation of Senegalese maafe even traveled with enslaved Africans to North America.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/08/AR2007050800381.html Where Settlers, Slaves and Natives Converged, a Way of Eating Was Born], By Geneva Collins, [[Washington Post]] Staff Writer, Wednesday, May 9, 2007; Page F01.</ref>

===Senegalese maafe===
Maafe or mafé was improved from bassi guerte, a peanut butter sauce served with chere a Senegalese couscous on millet basis.<ref>{{Cite book |last=François Sigaut, Hélène Franconie, Monique Chastanet |title=Couscous, boulgour et polenta transformer et consommer les céréales dans le monde |year=2010 |pages=161}}</ref> Malian tigadèguèna and Senegalese maafe being in taste and consistency different.<ref>{{Cite book |last=N'Diaye Haas |first=Joséphine |title=Cuisine sénégalaise}}</ref> Unlike Malian tigadèguèna, which is traditionally more watery and prepared with unrefined shea butter, the type of maafe prepared and consumed in [[Senegal]] is a rice-based dish with a creamy peanut paste sauce, tomato, oil, meat, onion, garlic, vegetables and spices which give it a particular flavor. Senegalese maafe is not only the national dish in Mali and Gambia, it is also prepared in various countries in West Africa as well as outside the African continent. In The Gambia, it is called domodah.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Niang |first=Cheikh |title=Cuisine d'Afrique et d'ailleurs |year=2022}}</ref>

=== The Gambia ===
Domoda is a type of groundnut stew found in [[The Gambia]].<ref name="Jacob Ashkenazi 2014">{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GmqEAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA481|title=The World Cookbook: The Greatest Recipes from Around the Globe, 2nd Edition: The Greatest Recipes from Around the Globe|last1=Jacob|first1=J.|last2=Ashkenazi|first2=M.|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2014|isbn=978-1-61069-469-8|volume=1|page=481|chapter=The Gambia}}</ref> Domoda is prepared using ground peanuts or peanut butter, meat, onion, tomato, garlic, seasonal vegetables and spices.<ref name="Jacob Ashkenazi 2014" /><ref name="Saine 2012 p. 95">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ikWccsfwZJAC&pg=PA95|title=Culture and Customs of Gambia|last=Saine|first=Abdoulaye|publisher=Greenwood|year=2012|isbn=978-0-313-35910-1|series=Culture and customs of Africa|page=95}}</ref> It has been described as one of the [[National dish|national dishes]] of The Gambia.<ref name="Saine 2012 p. 95" /> Domoda is typically served over rice, and is also sometimes served over ''[[Digitaria exilis|findi]]'', a grain that is similar to couscous in consistency.<ref name="Saine 2012 p. 95" />
