'''Gulab jamun''' is a sweet confectionery or dessert, originating in the [[Indian subcontinent]], and a type of [[Mithai (confectionery)|mithai]] popular in [[Indian cuisine|India]], [[Bangladeshi cuisine|Bangladesh]], [[Nepalese cuisine|Nepal]], [[Pakistani cuisine|Pakistan]], the [[Maldives]], as well as [[Burmese cuisine|Myanmar]]. It is also common in nations with substantial populations of people with South Asian heritage, such as [[Mauritius]], [[Fiji]], [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf states]], the [[Malay Peninsula]], [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[South Africa]], and the [[Caribbean]] ([[Jamaica]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Guyana]], and [[Suriname]]). 

It is made mainly from milk solids, traditionally ''[[Khoa|khoya]]'', which is milk reduced to the consistency of a soft dough. Modern recipes call for dried or powdered milk instead of ''khoya''. It is often garnished with dried nuts, such as [[almond]]s and [[cashew]]s, to enhance flavour.

== Preparation ==
In the Indian subcontinent, milk and cheese solids are prepared by heating milk over a low flame until the water content has evaporated and only the milk solids, known as ''khoya'', remain. The solids are kneaded with flour (maida), and small balls of this dough are deep-fried in oil or [[ghee]] (clarified butter) at a low temperature,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Marty Snortum |first=Lachu Moorjani |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sj6SMyPQ7nMC&q=Gulab+jamun |title=Ajanta: regional feasts of India |publisher=Gibbs Smith |year=2005 |isbn=1-58685-777-0 |page=17}}</ref> then soaked in a light [[sugar syrup]] flavored with green [[cardamom]] and [[rose water]], [[kewra]] or [[saffron]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://amchirecipes.com/content/gulab-jamoon |title=Gulab Jamun |last=shraddha.bht |website=Konkani Recipes |access-date=25 May 2010 |archive-date=10 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310083408/http://amchirecipes.com/content/gulab-jamoon |url-status=dead }}</ref> Hot gulab jamun is often served with vanilla ice cream, or [[kulfi]].

==Origins==
According to culinary historian Michael Krondl, 12th-century [[Manasollasa]] mentions a recipe for fried fritter balls made of ''chenna'' cheese and rice flour and soaked in cardamom-scented syrup, but this recipe did not use rosewater (gulab) syrup.<ref name="Michael2011">{{Cite book |last=Michael Krondl |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gN6ySQnUnfwC&pg=PA38 |title=Sweet Invention: A History of Dessert |publisher=Chicago Review Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-55652-954-2 |page=7-8|quote= "In another recipe he gives directions for a syrup-soaked fritter many modern Indians would recognize. To make it, the cook is told to curdle warm milk by adding buttermilk, then strain it to remove the liquid. (Nowadays this fresh cheese would be called chhana.) The resulting curds are then mixed with a little rice flour, formed into balls, and fried in ghee. Finally, they are soaked in syrup."}}</ref><ref name="Michael2014">{{Cite book |last=Michael Krondl |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rAeAAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA7 |title=The Donut: History, Recipes, and Lore from Boston to Berlin |date=1 June 2014 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |isbn=978-1-61374-673-8 |pages=7–8|quote=To make it, you form balls out of a dough of fresh cheese curds mixed with rice flour, fry these in ghee, and then soak them in cardamom-scented syrup.

[[File:Gulabjamun op.jpg|thumb|Gulabjamun in Maharashtrian style|279x279px]]
''Gulab jamun'' gets its brownish red colour because of the sugar content in the milk powder (''khoya''). In other types of ''gulab jamun'', [[sugar]] is added in the batter, and after frying, the sugar [[caramelization]] gives it its dark, almost [[black]] colour, which is then called ''kala jamun'' or "black jamun". The sugar syrup may be replaced with (slightly) diluted [[maple syrup]] for a ''gulab jamun''.

Homemade ''gulab jamun'' is usually made up of khoya, a pinch of all-purpose flour/refined wheat flour/ wheat flour (optional), baking powder and clarified butter ([[ghee]]); milk kneaded to form a dough, moulded into balls, deep fried and dropped into simmering sugar syrup.

In Bengali, Gulab Jamun is known as Kalo Jam or [[Pantua]], which is similar to ''gulab jamun'', and could be called a Bengali variant of that dish.<ref name="Charmaine_2003">{{Cite book |last=Charmaine O'Brien |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xeSXAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT145 |title=Flavours of Delhi: A Food Lover's Guide |publisher=Penguin Books Limited |year=2003 |isbn=978-93-5118-237-5 |page=145}}</ref> [[Ledikeni]], a variation of Pantua, is another variant of ''gulab jamun''.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Richardson |first=Tim H. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ETluYRHyjKwC&pg=PA334 |title=Sweets: A History of Candy |publisher=Bloomsbury USA |year=2002 |isbn=1-58234-229-6 |page=334}}</ref> It is said{{by whom|date=December 2017}} to have been invented by Bhim Chandra Nag on the occasion of a visit by [[Charlotte Canning, Countess Canning|Lady Canning]], the wife of Charles Canning, the Governor-General of India during 1856–62.

In [[Rajasthan]], instead of soaking gulab jamun balls in sugar syrup, they are cooked in gravy made from spices, nuts and tomato to make popular Gulab Jamun ki Sabzi.

In Western Madhya Pradesh and [[Malwa]], Mawa Bati is popular as local version of Gulab Jamun. It is different from Gulab jamun by size, fillings and amount of sweetness, Mawa bati is usually not immersed in Sugar syrup and slightly larger than Gulab Jamun.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mawa Bati {{!}} District Raisen, Government of Madhya Pradesh {{!}} India |url=https://raisen.nic.in/en/culinary-delight/mawa-bati/ |access-date=2023-11-24 |language=en-US}}</ref>

[[Arcot, Tamil Nadu|Arcot]], a town near [[Vellore]], is renowned for a local pastry known as Makkan Peda or Arcot Makkan Peda.

===Bangladesh===
In [[Bangladesh]], [[Pantua]] is available almost everywhere throughout the country, which can be referred to a [[Bengal]]i variation of Gulab jamun. Also there are two kinds of jamuns that are famous. They are Golap Jam ({{Lang|bn|গোলাপ জাম}}) and Kalo Jam ({{Lang|bn|কালো জাম}}).

=== Nepal ===
The sweet is known as Lal Mohan ({{Lang|ne|लालमोहन}}) in Nepali language and is available at almost every sweet shop. The sale of the sweet usually increases significantly during festivals such as [[Tihar (festival)|Tihar]] and [[Dashain]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=sampurna |title=सबैको प्यारो लालमोहन |url=https://sampurnaweekly.com/news/2315 |access-date=2022-12-05 |website=Sampurna Weekly |language=en |archive-date=5 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221205060129/https://sampurnaweekly.com/news/2315 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
