'''Beef bourguignon''' ({{IPAc-en|us|ˌ|b|ʊər|ɡ|iː|n|ˈ|j|ɒ̃}}) or '''bœuf bourguignon''' ({{IPAc-en|uk|ˌ|b|ɜː|f|_|ˈ|b|ɔːr|ɡ|ɪ|n|.|j|ɒ̃}};<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 3rd edition, 2013 [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/398163 ''s.v.'']</ref> {{IPA|fr|bœf buʁɡiɲɔ̃|lang}}), also called '''beef Burgundy''', and '''''bœuf à la Bourguignonne''''',<ref name="rhd">''Random House Dictionary'' [http://www.dictionary.com/browse/boeuf-bourguignon online at dictionary.com]</ref> is a [[French cuisine|French]] [[beef stew|stew]] of [[beef]] [[braised]] in [[red wine]], often red [[Burgundy wine|Burgundy]], and beef stock, typically flavored with [[carrot]]s, [[onion]]s, [[garlic]], and a ''[[bouquet garni]]'', and garnished with [[pearl onion]]s and [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]].<ref name="larousse">Prosper Montagné, ''Larousse Gastronomique'', English translation, Crown 1961 ''s.v.'' 'beef'/ 'beef ragoûts'</ref><ref name="bocuse"/><ref name="stange"/><ref name="escoffier">[[Auguste Escoffier]], "Pièce de bœuf à la bourguignonne", ''A Guide to Modern Cookery'', 1907 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y8vGoOD_uFIC&pg=PA853 p. 379]</ref>

"Bourguignon" is, since the mid-nineteenth century, a culinary term applied to various dishes prepared with wine or with a mushroom and onion garnish.<ref name="xix">Pierre Larousse, ''Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe siècle'', '''2''', 1867 [https://books.google.com/books?id=6gpMa7VeyU0C&pg=PA1133 ''s.v.'']</ref><ref name="lady">A French Lady, "Gigot à la Bourguignonne", ''Cookery for English Households'', 1864, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uS9dAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA139 p. 139]</ref><ref name="francatelli">Charles Elmé Francatelli, "Rabbits, à la bourguignonne", ''The Modern Cook'', 1846 [https://books.google.com/books?id=yH8EAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA320 p. 320]</ref>
It is probably not a regional recipe from Burgundy.<ref name="chev">Jim Chevallier, ''A History of the Food of Paris: From Roast Mammoth to Steak Frites'', 2018, {{isbn|1442272821}}, p. 191</ref><ref name="stange"/>

When made with whole roasts, the meat was often [[lardon#Larding|larded]].<ref name="stange"/>

==History==
The dish is often "touted as traditional", but it was first documented in 1867,<ref name="xix"/> and "does not appear to be very old".<ref name="chev"/> Other recipes called "à la Bourguignonne" with similar garnishes were found in the mid-19th century for leg of lamb<ref name="lady"/> and for rabbit.<ref name="francatelli"/> In the 19th century, it "did not enjoy a great reputation", perhaps because it was often made with leftover cooked meat.<ref name="chev"/><ref>Marcel Butler, ''La bonne cuisine pour tous'', Paris, 1885, {{BNF|301806016}}, [https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k110690c/f244.item p. 241-2]</ref>

The dish has become a standard of French cuisine, notably in Parisian [[Bistro|bistrots]]; however, it only began to be considered a [[Cuisine of Burgundy|Burgundian specialty]] in the twentieth century.<ref name="chev"/>

The co-authors of ''[[Mastering the Art of French Cooking]]'', [[Simone Beck]], [[Louisette Bertholle]], and [[Julia Child]], have described the dish as "certainly one of the most delicious beef dishes concocted by man".<ref name="child">[[Simone Beck]], [[Louisette Bertholle]] and [[Julia Child]], ''[[Mastering the Art of French Cooking]]'' '''1''':315 {{isbn|0394721780}}, 1961</ref>
