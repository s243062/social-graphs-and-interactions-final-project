An '''apple pie''' is a [[pie]] in which the principal filling is [[apple]]s. It is often served with [[whipped cream]], [[ice cream]] ("apple pie [[à la mode]]"), [[custard]] or [[cheddar cheese]].<ref name=Atlas>{{cite news |last1=Waters |first1=Michael |title=The Long, Storied Controversy Over Cheese on Apple Pie |url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/cheese-apple-pie |access-date=11 June 2018 |work=Atlas Obscura |date=13 July 2017}}</ref> It is generally double-crusted, with pastry both above and below the filling; the upper crust may be solid or latticed (woven of crosswise strips). The bottom crust may be baked separately ("[[Blind-baking|blind]]") to prevent it from getting soggy. [[Tarte Tatin]] is baked with the crust on top, but served with it on the bottom.

Originating in the [[14th century]] in England, apple pie recipes are now a standard part of cuisines in many countries where apples grow. Apple pie is a significant dessert in many countries, including the United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden, Norway, Australia, Germany, New Zealand, and the United States.<ref name="Pinch" />

==Ingredients==
[[File:Baking a Pie (Unsplash).jpg|thumb|Ingredients of an apple pie]]
Apple pie can be made with many different sorts of apples. The more popular [[cooking apple]]s include [[Braeburn]], [[Gala (apple)|Gala]], [[Cortland (apple)|Cortland]], [[Bramley (apple)|Bramley]], [[Empire (apple)|Empire]], [[Northern Spy]], [[Granny Smith]], and [[McIntosh (apple)|McIntosh]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Best Apples for Apple Pie|url = http://www.stemilt.com/blog/tips/best-apples-for-apple-pie/|website = Farm Blog {{!}} The Stemilt Blog|date = 2015-09-28|access-date = 2015-12-21}}</ref> The fruit for the pie can be fresh, canned, or reconstituted from [[dried fruit|dried apple]]s. Dried or preserved apples were originally substituted only at times when fresh [[fruit]] was unavailable. The basic ingredients of the filling are [[sugar]], [[butter]], a thickener like [[cornstarch]] and an acidic ingredient like [[lemon juice]]. Spices are added most commonly cinnamon,  [[nutmeg]].<ref name="foodnetwork.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/apple-pie-recipe.html|title=Apple Pie|website=Food Network}}</ref> and lemon juice which is used to prevent oxidation of the apples when [[macerating]] the filling. Many older recipes call for honey in place of the then-expensive sugar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfile.org/7-facts-about-apple-pie|title=7 Facts about Apple Pie|date=13 March 2015}}</ref>

==Serving==
[[File:Apple cake with vanilla ice cream 2.jpg|thumb|A serving of apple pie topped with vanilla ice cream]]
Apple pie is often served ''[[Pie à la Mode|à la mode]]'', that is, topped with [[ice cream]].

{{anchor|cheese}}In another serving style, a piece of [[sharp cheddar]] cheese is placed on top of or alongside a slice of the finished pie.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.thekitchn.com/an-apple-pie-without-the-chees-99573|title=An apple pie without the cheese |publisher= 2012 Apartment Therapy |access-date=2012-06-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ochef.com/r125.htm | title = Apple Pie | publisher = OChef | access-date = 2012-04-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hungermountain.coop/OurCommunity/News/tabid/148/entryid/177/Default.aspx | title = Product Highlight: Apple Pie, Sharp Cheddar, and A Nice Cup of Coffee | publisher = Hunger Mountain Coop | access-date = 2012-04-07 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161201081915/http://www.hungermountain.coop/OurCommunity/News/tabid/148/entryid/177/Default.aspx | archive-date = 1 December 2016 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Apple pie with cheddar is popular in the [[American Midwest]] and [[New England]], particularly in [[Vermont]], where it is considered the [[List of U.S. state foods|state dish]].<ref name=Atlas /> In the north of England, Cheddar or [[Wensleydale cheese]] is often used.<ref>Catherine Donnelly, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Cheese'', {{isbn|0199330905}}, 2016, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pRrGDQAAQBAJ&q=apple%20pie%20 p. 762]</ref><ref>Walter Gore Marshall, ''Through America Or, Nine Months in the United States'', 1882 [https://books.google.com/books?id=QlITAAAAYAAJ&dq=apple+pie&pg=PA99 p. 99]</ref>

In English-speaking countries, apple pie, often considered a [[comfort food]], is a popular dessert, eaten hot or cold, on its own or with [[ice cream]], [[cream|double cream]], or custard. Apple pies are often sold as mini versions in multipacks.{{Cn|date=December 2024}}

Recipes for Dutch apple pie go back to the [[Middle Ages]]. An early Dutch language [[cookbook]] from 1514, {{Lang|nl|Een notabel boecxken van cokeryen}} ("A notable little cookery book"), [[Letterpress printing|letterpress printed]] in [[Brussels]] by [[Thomas van der Noot]], who may also have been the author,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kookhistorie.nl/NBC/index_nbc.htm |title=Home Notabel Boecxken van Cokeryen door Thomas vander Noot (1514) |publisher=Kookhistorie.nl |date=2002-08-13 |access-date=2013-11-05}}</ref> documents a recipe for {{Lang|nl|Appeltaerten}} (modern Dutch [[wikt:appeltaart|''Appeltaarten'']] 'apple pies'). This early recipe was simple, requiring only a standard pie crust, slices of especially soft apples with their skin and seeds removed, and {{Lang|nl|den selven deeghe daer die taerte af ghemaect es}} (more of the same dough) on top. It was then baked in a typical [[Dutch oven]]. Once baked, the top crust (except at the edges) would be cut out from the middle, after which the apple slices were potentially put through a [[sieve]] before the pie was stirred with a wooden spoon. At this point the book recommends adding several [[spice]]s to the pie, namely: [[cardamom]], [[ginger]], [[cinnamon]], [[nutmeg]], [[clove]], [[Mace (spice)|mace]] and [[powdered sugar]]. Finally, after mixing the ingredients into the pie with [[cream]], it is once again put into the oven to dry.<ref>[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_not001nota01_01/_not001nota01_01_0003.php Een notabel boecxken van cokeryen - 123 Appeltaerten.], ''[http://dbnl.org dbnl.org]''</ref>

Traditional [[Dutch cuisine|Dutch]] apple pie comes in two varieties, a crumb or [[streusel]]-top ({{Lang|nl|appelkruimeltaart}}) and a [[Lattice (pastry)|lattice-top]] ({{Lang|nl|appeltaart}}) style pie. In the US, "Dutch apple pie" refers specifically to crumb-top variety.<ref name="stemilt.com" /> Both recipes are distinct in that they typically call for flavourings of [[cinnamon]] and [[lemon juice]] to be added and differ in texture, not taste.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recipestap.com/more-apple-cakes-hollandse-appeltaart-aka-dutch-apple-tart |title=Recipe: More apple cakes: Hollandse appeltaart aka Dutch Apple Tart |publisher=Recipes Tap |access-date=2013-11-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012012659/http://www.recipestap.com/more-apple-cakes-hollandse-appeltaart-aka-dutch-apple-tart |archive-date=12 October 2013 }}</ref><ref name="stemilt.com">{{Cite news|url=https://www.stemilt.com/stem-blog/dutch-apple-pie/|title=Dutch Apple Pie {{!}} Stemilt|date=2016-10-17|newspaper=Stemilt|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-15}}</ref> Dutch apple pies may include ingredients such as full-cream butter, raisins and [[almond paste]], in addition to ingredients such as apples and sugar, which they have in common with other recipes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kookhistorie.nl/images/vk-scan/vk-c3r.jpg |title=page 21 "De verstandige kock of sorghvuldige huyshoudster (anno 1669)"|access-date=2013-11-05}}</ref> Both modern types have a standard pie crust on the bottom and around the edges.

== French style ==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2020}}

[[File:Tarte.tatin.wmt.jpg|thumb|''[[Tarte Tatin]]'', a French variation on apple pie]]
One kind of [[French cuisine|French]] style apple pie is very different compared to the typical version of the sweet dessert. Instead of it being right side up with crust on top and bottom, it is upside down, with the exposed fruit being caramelised. This can be made not only with apples but other fruits or vegetables as well, for example, pears or tomatoes.
''See [[Tarte Tatin]].''

Others use a more traditional presentation, including variants like the [[Norman tart]].

==Swedish style==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2023}}
The [[Swedish cuisine|Swedish]] style apple pie is predominantly a variety of apple [[crumble]], rather than a traditional pastry pie. Often, breadcrumbs are used (wholly or partially) instead of flour, and sometimes rolled oats. It is usually flavoured with cinnamon and served with vanilla [[custard]] or ice cream. There is also a very popular version called {{Lang|sv|äppelkaka}} (apple cake), which differs from the pie in that it is a [[sponge cake]] baked with fresh apple pieces in it.

Apple pie was brought to the colonies by the [[English colonists|English]], the [[Dutch people|Dutch]], and the [[Swedes]] during the 17th and 18th centuries.{{cn|date=March 2023}} Two recipes for apple pie appear in America's first cookbook, ''[[American Cookery]]'' by [[Amelia Simmons]], which was published in 1796.

The apple pie had to wait for the planting of European varieties, brought across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], to become fruit-bearing apple trees, to be selected for their cooking qualities as there were no native apples except [[crabapple]]s, which yield very small and sour fruit.<ref name="app">{{cite web

Apple pie was a common food in 18th-century [[Delaware]]. As noted by the New Sweden historian Dr. [[Israel Acrelius]] in a letter: "Apple pie is used throughout the whole year, and when fresh Apples are no longer to be had, dried ones are used. It is the evening meal of children."<ref>{{cite web|last=Stradley|first=Linda|title=Apple Pie - History of Apple Pie|url=http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/PieHistory/ApplePie.htm|work=What's Cooking America.net|access-date=2 July 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110610202255/http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/PieHistory/ApplePie.htm| archive-date= 10 June 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>

Jack Holden and Frances Kay sang in their patriotic 1950 song "The Fiery Bear", creating contrast between this symbol of U.S. culture and the [[Russian bear]] of the [[Soviet Union]]:

:We love our baseball and apple pie
:We love our county fair
:We'll keep Old Glory waving high
:There's no place here for a bear

Advertisers exploited the patriotic connection in the 1970s with the commercial jingle "[[baseball]], [[hot dog]]s, apple pie and [[Chevrolet]]".
