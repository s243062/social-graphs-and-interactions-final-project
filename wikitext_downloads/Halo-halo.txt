''Haluhalo'' is more commonly spelled as "'''''halo-halo'''''", which literally means "mix-mix" in English.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Halo-Halo, Mix-Mix |url=https://www.halohalomixmix.com/ }}</ref> Haluhalo is the official spelling in the [[Commission on the Filipino Language]]'s dictionary. The word is an [[adjective]] meaning "mixed [together]" in [[Filipino language|Filipino]].

==History==
The origin of ''haluhalo'' is traced to the [[American colonization of the Philippines|pre-war]] [[Japanese in the Philippines|Japanese Filipinos]] and the Japanese ''[[kakigōri]]'' class of desserts. One of the earliest versions of ''haluhalo'' was a dessert known locally as ''monggo con hielo'' (derived from the [[Spanish Filipino]] dessert ''[[maíz con hielo]]'') or ''mongo-ya,'' which consisted of only [[mung bean]]s ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]: ''monggo'' or ''munggo'', used in place of red [[Adzuki bean|azuki beans]] from [[Japan]]), boiled and cooked in syrup (''minatamis na monggo''), served on top of crushed ice with milk and sugar.<ref name=":1"/><ref name=":2"/>

Over time, more native ingredients were added, resulting in the creation and development of the modern ''haluhalo''. One difference between ''haluhalo'' and its Japanese ancestor is the placement of ingredients mainly under the ice instead of on top of it. The original ''monggo con hielo'' can still be found today, with similar variations using [[sweet corn]] (''mais con hielo'') or ''[[Saba banana|saba]]'' [[banana]]s (''saba con hielo'').<ref name=":1">{{cite news|last1=Ocampo|first1=Ambeth R.|authorlink=Ambeth Ocampo|title=Japanese origins of the Philippine 'halo-halo'|url=https://opinion.inquirer.net/35790/japanese-origins-of-the-philippine-halo-halo|access-date=April 23, 2019|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|archive-date=April 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423093030/https://opinion.inquirer.net/35790/japanese-origins-of-the-philippine-halo-halo|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Halo-Halo Graham Float Recipe|url=https://www.pinoyrecipe.net/halo-halo-graham-float-recipe/|access-date=July 24, 2019|website=Pinoy Recipe at Iba Pa|date=July 24, 2019|archive-date=July 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190724023553/https://www.pinoyrecipe.net/halo-halo-graham-float-recipe/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=FilipiKnow |title=Halo-Halo: The Surprising Origin of Philippines' Beloved Dessert |url=https://filipiknow.net/halo-halo-filipino-dessert/ |access-date=February 17, 2022 |website=FilipiKnow |date=January 18, 2019 |language=en-us |archive-date=March 4, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220304223111/https://filipiknow.net/halo-halo-filipino-dessert/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web |last=Valdeavilla |first=Ronica |date=March 13, 2018 |title=Halo-Halo: Favourite Dessert of The Philippines |url=https://theculturetrip.com/asia/philippines/articles/the-curious-history-of-halo-halo-the-philippines-favourite-dessert/ |access-date=February 17, 2022 |website=Culture Trip |archive-date=March 4, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220304221608/https://theculturetrip.com/asia/philippines/articles/the-curious-history-of-halo-halo-the-philippines-favourite-dessert/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Some authors specifically attribute ''haluhalo'' to the 1920s or 1930s [[Japanese in the Philippines|Japanese migrants]] in the [[Quinta Market]] of [[Quiapo, Manila]], due to its proximity to the [[Insular Ice Plant]], Quiapo's main ice supply.<ref name="zialcita">{{cite book|author=Crisol, Christine|title=Quiapo: Heart of Manila|publisher=Quiapo Printing|year=2006|isbn=978-971-93673-0-7|editor=Zialcita, Fernando N.|place=Manila|page=321|chapter=A ''Halo-Halo'' Menu|quote=Today, many non-Quiapense informants in their forties and older associate the Quinta Market with this dessert. Why did this market become important in the invention of this dessert? Aside from its being a Japanese legacy in the area [...] of all the city markets, the Quinta was closest to the [[ice]].}}</ref> The [[Insular Ice Plant]] was built in 1902 by the [[Americans]], which became the ice supplier for the [[Philippines]]. Although the ice plant was built, it was not the first introduction of ice to the Philippines. In the mid-19th century, the [[United States]] exported ice from [[Wenham Lake]] to different countries, including [[India]], [[Australia]], and the Philippines.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />

==Description==
[[File:Buko halo from Koronadal City.jpg|thumb|[[Buko halo]], a combination of haluhalo and [[buko salad]], usually served directly on coconut shells]]

There is no standard set of ingredients for ''haluhalo'' as the ingredients can vary widely, but the dessert usually includes [[Kaong palm|sugar palm]] fruit (''kaong''), [[coconut sport]] (''macapuno''), [[Saba banana|saba]] [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]] cooked in syrup (''[[minatamis na saging]]''), [[jackfruit]] (''langkâ''), agar jellies (''[[gulaman]]''), [[tapioca pearls]], [[nata de coco]], [[sweet potato]] (''kamote''), sweetened beans, cheese, pounded toasted young rice (''[[pinipig]]''), and [[ice cream]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" />

The ingredients are placed in specific positions. The fruit, beans, and other sweets are placed at the bottom, followed by shaved ice, and then topped with [[Leche Flan|leche flan]], ''[[ube halaya]]'' (mashed [[purple yam]]), [[ice cream]], or any combination of the three. [[Evaporated milk]] or [[coconut milk]] is poured into the mixture upon serving.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" /> There are local and regional varieties of haluhalo throughout the country, which include different and/or additional ingredients than those previously listed, including sweetened [[Wax gourd|wintermelon]], [[durian]], and strawberry ice cream, among others.<ref>{{Cite web |date=April 15, 2020 |title=7 Unique HALO-HALO Versions around the Philippines |url=https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2020/04/philippines-halo-halo/ |access-date=March 21, 2022 |website=The Poor Traveler Itinerary Blog |language=en-US |archive-date=January 25, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220125190052/https://www.thepoortraveler.net/2020/04/philippines-halo-halo/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

There's a similar [[Visayas|Visayan]] dessert called ''[[binignit]]'', which is referred to as "''ginataang haluhalo''" in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] ("mixed [ingredients] in [[coconut milk]]") and commonly shortened to "''[[ginataan]]''". It uses a lot of the same ingredients, although it's usually served hot.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Merano|first1=Vanjo|title=Ginataang Halo-halo Recipe (Binignit)|url=http://panlasangpinoy.com/2010/07/14/ginataang-halo-halo-recipe/|website=Panlasang Pinoy|date=July 15, 2010|access-date=May 13, 2016|archive-date=December 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209070328/http://panlasangpinoy.com/2010/07/14/ginataang-halo-halo-recipe/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ginataan Halo-Halo|url=http://www.filipino-food-recipes.com/ginataan.html|website=Filipino Food Recipes|access-date=May 13, 2016|archive-date=October 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011130558/http://www.filipino-food-recipes.com/ginataan.html|url-status=usurped}}</ref>
