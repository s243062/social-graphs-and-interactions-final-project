==Etymology and spelling==
[[File:Yummy Sabudana Khichdi.jpg|thumb|220px|''[[Sabudana khichri]]'' is a popular food during [[Shivratri]] or [[Navratri]] fasts.]]
The word ''Khichdī'' is derived from [[Sanskrit]] {{lang|sa|खिच्चा}} ''{{transliteration|hi|ISO|khiccā}}'',<ref name="Oxford University Press">{{cite book |title=The Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-19-864339-5 |editor=McGregor |editor-first=R.S. |editor-link=R. S. McGregor |page=237}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=2021-07-17 |title=Tale of the humble 'Khichdi' |work=[[The Times of India]] |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food-news/the-tale-of-humble-khichdi/articleshow/75610905.cms |access-date=2023-08-15 |issn=0971-8257}}</ref> a dish of rice and legumes.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary |last=Monier-Williams |first=Monier |author-link=Monier Monier-Williams |year=1995 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |location=Delhi |isbn=81-208-0065-6 |page=339 |url=http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/index.html |access-date=2010-06-29}}</ref>

Some divergence of transliteration may be noted in the third consonant in the word ''khicṛī''. The sound is the [[retroflex flap]] {{IPAblink|ɽ}}, which is written in [[Standard Hindi|Hindi]] with the [[Devanagari]] letter ⟨{{lang|hi|ड़}}⟩, and in [[Urdu alphabet|Urdu script]] with the [[Perso-Arabic script|Perso-Arabic]] letter ⟨{{lang|ur|{{nq|[[Ṛe|ڑ]]}}}}⟩. In [[Hindustani phonology]], the etymological origin of the retroflex flap was {{IPAslink|ɖ}} when it occurred between vowels.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Indo-Aryan Languages |last=Masica |first=Colin P. |author-link=Colin Masica |year=1991 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-23420-4 |pages=97–98 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Itp2twGR6tsC&pg=PP1 |access-date=2010-06-29}}</ref> Hence in Devanagari the letter ⟨{{lang|hi|ड}}⟩, representing {{IPA|/ɖ/}}, was adapted to write {{IPA|/ɽ/}} by adding a diacritic under it. In Urdu script, the phonological quality of the flap was represented by adapting the letter ⟨{{lang|ur|{{nq|[[Resh|ر]]}}}}⟩, representing {{IPA|/r/}}, with a diacritic added above it to indicate the retroflex quality. The occurrence of this consonant in the word {{Transliteration|hi|ISO|khicṛī}} has given rise to two alternative spellings in English: ''khichri'', which reflects its phonology, and ''khichdi'', which reflects its etymology.

==History==

Khichdi is a very popular dish across the [[Indian subcontinent]] which consists of, [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Nepal]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. The dish is also widely prepared in many [[Indian states]], such as [[Punjab]], [[Haryana]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Karnataka]], [[Telangana]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Gujarat]], [[Tamilnadu|Tamil Nadu]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[West Bengal]], [[Assam]], [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Odisha]], and [[Maharashtra]].<ref name="Chatterjee 2017">{{cite web |last=Chatterjee |first=Priyadarshini |title=From Kashmir to Karnataka, khichdi is the one true underestimated food of India |website=Scroll.in |date=2017-02-10 |url=https://scroll.in/magazine/823997/from-kashmir-to-karnataka-khichdi-is-the-one-true-underestimated-food-of-india |access-date=2017-02-10}}</ref> Vegetables such as [[cauliflower]], potato, and green [[pea]]s are commonly added.{{Citation needed|date=October 2024}}

The [[Hyderabadi Muslims|Hyderabadi Muslim]] community, of the erstwhile [[Hyderabad State]], in present-day [[Telangana]], [[Marathwada]], and [[Kalyana-Karnataka]] regions, make ''khichdi'' as a common breakfast dish, and is an important part of [[Hyderabadi cuisine]].<ref name="KhichdiKhattaKheema">{{cite web |url=https://talkistania.wordpress.com/2013/02/15/hyderabadi-brunch-khichdi-khatta-kheema/ |title=Hyderabadi Brunch: Khichdi Khatta Kheema |date=2013-02-15 |website=talkistania |access-date=2016-08-22}}</ref> The dish is called ''khichri'', ''kheema'', ''khatta'', or other switch-around versions of the previous, named after the three parts of the meal, ''Khichri'', ground beef, and a sour sauce, made of tamarind and sesame.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mykitchenaroma.blogspot.ca/2013/04/khichdi-keema-khatta.html |title=My Kitchen's Aroma: Khichdi Keema Khatta |website=mykitchenaroma.blogspot.ca |date=28 April 2013 |access-date=2016-08-22}}</ref>

==National dish controversy==
In 2017, Indian media unofficially designated it as the "national dish", as it is being globally promoted by the [[government of India]] as "queen of all foods". The report that the government may designate ''khichri'' as India's "national dish" brought significant ridicule from the opposition politicians.<ref>{{cite web |date=2017-11-02 |title=Nothing cooking: Khichdi not national dish, says minister after Twitter storm |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nothing-cooking-khichdi-not-national-dish-says-minister-after-twitter-storm/story-m88Y723Vh2kJM5n7bwNUvN.html |access-date=2022-10-09 |website=Hindustan Times}}</ref>

However, India's [[Ministry of Food Processing Industries|Minister of Food Processing Industries]] [[Harsimrat Kaur Badal]] clarified that while ''khichdi'' is considered nutritious and healthy food in India, the government did not have any plans to designate a national food.<ref>{{cite news |last=IANS |date=2017-11-01 |title=Government to designate 'khichdi' as national dish |work=[[Business Standard]] India |url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/government-to-designate-khichdi-as-national-dish-117110101260_1.html |access-date=2022-10-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=2 November 2017 |agency=PTI |title='Fictitious' Khichdi Cooked Up, Says Minister On National Dish Buzz |url=https://www.ndtv.com/food/fictitious-says-union-minister-harsimrat-kaur-badal-khichdi-wont-be-the-national-dish-1769941 |access-date=2022-10-09 |website=NDTV}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/khichdi-not-national-food-clarifies-harsimrat-kaur-badal/article19966572.ece |title=Khichdi not national food, clarifies Harsimrat Kaur Badal |date=2 November 2017 |newspaper=The Hindu |access-date=22 February 2020}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
''Khichdi'' has lent its name to media synonymous with ensembles or potpourri as depicted in the popular culture through movies such as ''[[Khichdi: The Movie]]'', and TV sitcoms such as ''[[Khichdi (2002 TV series)|Khichdi]]'' and ''[[Instant Khichdi]]''.
