'''Dumplings''' are a broad class of dishes that consist of pieces of cooked [[dough]] (made from a variety of [[starch]]y sources), often wrapped around a filling. The dough can be based on [[bread]], wheat or other [[flour]]s, or [[potato]]es, and it may be filled with [[meat]], [[Fish as food|fish]], [[tofu]], [[cheese]], [[vegetable]]s, or a combination. Dumplings may be prepared using a variety of cooking methods and are found in many world cuisines.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last=Gallani |first=Barbara |title=Dumplings: a global history |date=2015 |publisher=Reaktion Books |isbn=978-1-78023-433-5 |location=London, UK |oclc=906746909}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web |title=What's a dumpling?

One of the earliest mentions of dumplings comes from the Chinese scholar [[Shu Xi]] who mentions them in a poem 1,700 years ago. In addition, archaeologically preserved dumplings have been found in [[Turpan|Turfan]], [[Xinjiang]], [[China]] dating back over 1,000 years.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Brunch |first=The Bit Bots |title=How a Simple Dish Conquered the World? |url=https://thebitbotsbrunch.beehiiv.com/p/origins-of-dumplings?utm_source=thebitbotsbrunch.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=how-a-simple-dish-conquered-the-world |access-date=2024-12-04 |website=The Bit Bots Brunch |language=en}}</ref>

The precise definition of a dumpling is controversial, varying across individuals and cultures.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> The term emerged in English by the 17th century, where it referred to a small lump of dough cooked by simmering or steaming.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book |last=Davidson |first=Alan |title=The Oxford companion to food |publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2014 |editor=Tom Jaine |isbn=978-0-19-967733-7 |edition=3rd |location=New York |oclc=890807357}}</ref><ref name=":2" /> The definition has since grown to include filled dumplings, where the dough encloses a sweet or savory filling.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Labensky |first=Sarah R. |title=On cooking: a textbook of culinary fundamentals |publisher=Pearson |date=2019 |author2=Alan M.

[[Banku (dish)|Banku]] and [[kenkey]] are West African preparations defined as dumplings in that they are steamed starchy balls of dough. Both are formed from [[fermented]] [[cornmeal]]. Banku is boiled and requires continuous kneading, while kenkey is partly boiled then finished by steaming in corn or [[banana]] leaves.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.congocookbook.com/staple_dish_recipes/banku_and_kenkey.html | title = Banku & Kenkey | work = The Congo Cookbook | year = 2009 | first = Ed | last = Gibbon | access-date = 22 July 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180113051827/http://www.congocookbook.com/staple_dish_recipes/banku_and_kenkey.html | archive-date = 13 January 2018 }}</ref>

[[Empanadas]], whose stuffing, manufacture and types are numerous and varied, differ from traditional dumplings in that they are deep fried, steamed, or baked, and excess dough is not cut off.

=== Bajan ===
In [[Barbados]], dumplings differ from those in other [[Caribbean]] islands in that they are slightly sweetened. The dumplings may either be of the flour or cornmeal variety. The dough is flavoured with spices, cinnamon and [[nutmeg]]. Dumplings are often boiled in Bajan soup. When found in stew-like dishes, the dumplings are steamed along with [[Ground provisions|ground provision]], salted meat, [[Cooking banana|plantain]] and other ingredients, and then served with [[gravy]].

=== Brazilian ===
In [[Brazil]], there are a variety of dumplings. [[pastel (food)|Pastéis]] are made of a thin dough that can be stuffed with a variety of fillings, such as condimented ground beef, chicken, shrimp, mixed vegetables, cheese, or even sweets, and they are typically fried or baked. {{ill|Empadinha|lt=Empada|pt|Empada}} is made of muffin-shaped dough stuffed primarily with chicken, cheese or seafood. [[Coxinha]]s are prepared from a thick dough stuffed with chicken (akin to a chicken [[corn dog]]). Bolinhas, which literally translates to 'little balls', can have meat ({{lang|pt|bolinhas de carne}}) or cheese ({{lang|pt|bolinhas de queijo}}) inside.

All of these dumplings can vary from their original forms with optional additions like olives, onions, or spices. They are commonly served at parties. In some parts of Brazil like Rio, dumplings can be found in fast-food kiosks ('open restaurants'), in the city, or in parks.

=== Caribbean ===
Dumplings are made from a simple dough consisting of all-purpose flour, water, and salt. The shaped dumplings are either fried in a pan until golden brown or boiled in a soup. The fried version is usually served as an accompaniment to breakfast codfish.

=== Chilean ===
In [[Chile]], [[pantruca]]s are a type of flat, elongated irregular dumpling flavoured with fresh [[parsley]] and served in soup. In Chiloé, a Chilean southern archipelago where potatoes are native, several traditional dumplings are potato-based, including ''chapalele'', ''milcao'', ''chuchoca'', ''chuhuañe'', and ''vaeme''. Their dough can also include wheat flour or lard in varying proportions. They can be flat and round, filled with greaves and fried (''milcao''); flat and boiled (''chapaleles'', ''milcaos''); or shaped into a roll and roasted on a stick (''[[chochoca]]''). They may be served with honey as a dessert.

''Papas rellenas'' are made of a potato- and flour-based dough surrounding a seasoned meat filling.

=== Dominican Republic ===
[[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] domplines arrived with [[cocolo]]s. They came from the [[British Caribbean]] to work in the sugar industry and mainly settled in and around [[San Pedro de Macorís]]. They are made with flour and water, rolled into spinners and boiled into soups or salted water and eaten with stews or simply with butter.

=== Haitian===
In [[Haiti]], ''doumbrey'' are elongated flour dumplings. They are made with flour and water, rolled, and boiled in water before being added to soups and stews.

=== Jamaican ===
Dumplings come in three forms in [[Jamaica]]: fried, boiled, and roasted. All are made with flour, and those made with white flour dumplings are often mixed with a bit of cornmeal. These foods are often served with a variety of dishes like [[ackee and saltfish]], [[kidney (food)|kidney]]s, [[liver (food)|liver]], salt mackerel, etc., and often taste better when refried. A refried dumpling is an already-boiled dumpling left over from previous cooking that is then fried to give it a slightly crispy outer layer and a tender middle. A purely fried white flour dumpling (also known as a "Johnny Cake") is golden brown and looks similar to a [[buñuelo]]; these can often substitute for boiled dumplings, but they are mostly consumed as part of [[breakfast]]. Fried dumplings can be made with or without sugar. One popular variation is the [[Festival (dumpling)|Jamaican festival]], a cylindrical fried dumpling made with flour, sugar, cornmeal, and baking powder. These slightly sweet dumplings are served with all types of traditional Jamaican home food, particularly as a complement to the sweet-and-sour [[escovitch]] fish, as well as [[street food]].

=== Peruvian ===
[[File:Papas rellenas Perú.jpg|thumb|Papas rellenas]]
''Papas rellenas'', or stuffed potatoes, consist of a handful of mashed potatoes flattened in the palm of the hand and stuffed with a savory combination of ingredients. The stuffing usually consists of sautéed meat (such as beef, pork, or chicken), onions, and garlic. They are all seasoned with cumin, aji sauce, raisins, peanuts, olives, and sliced or chopped [[Boiled egg|hard-boiled eggs]]. After stuffing, a ball is formed, rolled in flour, and [[Deep frying|deep-fried]] in hot oil. The stuffed potatoes are usually accompanied by a sauce consisting of sliced onions, lime juice, [[olive oil]], salt, pepper, and slices of fresh peppers. The same dish may also be made with [[seafood]]. In some countries, [[Cassava|yuca purée]] is used as the starch component.

=== Puerto Rican ===
In [[Puerto Rico]], dumplings are made of grated tubers such as [[Cassava|yuca]], [[sweet potato]] and [[Eddoe|malanga]] or [[cornmeal]], [[breadfruit]], [[Squash (plant)|squash]], unripe bananas, or plantains mixed with flour, water, milk or coconut milk, garlic, salt, [[annatto]] and parsley. These dumplings are a traditional part of Puerto Rican-style [[pigeon pea]] soup called [[asopao]]. The dough is kneaded into a bowl or on a table until smooth and pliable, it is then covered and placed aside up to an hour or over night. The dumplings are then formed into small balls and dropped into boiling water or then can be fried before placing them into the soup.

[[Alcapurria]] is a popular fried street dumpling that resembles [[kibbeh]]. The dough is made from yautía, green banana, and lard and stuffed with meat.

The [[pasteles|pastel]], a dumpling made from a ''[[masa]]'' of grated root vegetables, squash, plantains, and unripe bananas, is greatly beloved, especially around [[Christmas]]. The Puerto Rican variety has a tender,  slightly wet consistency. The masa dough is mixed with milk and annatto mixed in oil or lard, then stuffed with stewed pork, [[chick peas]], olives, [[capers]] or even raisins. The dumplings are then wrapped in a fragrant banana leaf, tied, and then boiled or steamed. The origin of ''pasteles'' leads back to Natives on the island of [[Puerto Rico|Borikén]]. Pasteles are popular in the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Hawaii]], [[Trinidad]] and lately seen in [[Cuba]]n cuisine.

=== Salvadoran ===
[[Pupusas]], a thick griddle cake or flatbread from [[El Salvador]] and [[Honduras]], are made with cornmeal or rice flour, similar to the Venezuelan and [[Colombia]]n [[arepa]]. They are usually stuffed with one or more ingredients, which may include cheese (such as quesillo or cheese with loroco buds), chicharrón, squash, or refried beans. They are typically accompanied by curtido (a spicy fermented cabbage slaw) and tomato [[Salsa (Mexican cuisine)|salsa]], and are traditionally eaten by hand.

=== Venezuela ===
In the city of [[El Callao (Venezuela)|El Callao]], ''domplines'' are fried and made from [[wheat]], and usually filled with curry chicken and cheese.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elestimulo.com/bienmesabe/gastronomia-callaoense-sobrevive-puertas-adentro/|title=Gastronomía callaoense sobrevive puertas adentro|last=Griffin|first=Ana Carolina|date=3 September 2019|website=El Estímulo|language=es|access-date=19 September 2019|archive-date=30 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190930114952/http://elestimulo.com/bienmesabe/gastronomia-callaoense-sobrevive-puertas-adentro/|url-status=live}}</ref> There are usually present in the carnivals of [[Calypso de El Callao]].

[[File:Manti in a steam cooker.jpg|thumb|Kazakh/Uzbek/Tajik [[Manti (dumpling)|manti]] in a steamer]]

[[Manti (dumpling)|Manti]] (also ''manty'' or ''mantu'') is a steamed dumpling in [[Central Asian cuisine|Central Asian]] and [[Chinese Islamic cuisine]]. It contains a mixture of ground lamb (or beef) spiced with black pepper, enclosed in a dough wrapper. Manti are cooked in a multi-level steamer (''mantovarka'') and served topped with butter, yogurt, sour cream, or onion sauce. These dumplings are popular throughout Central Asia, including in [[Afghan cuisine|Afghanistan]], [[Kazakh cuisine|Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyz cuisine|Kyrgyzstan]], [[Pashtun cuisine|Pakistan]], [[Tajik cuisine|Tajikistan]], [[Uzbek cuisine|Uzbekistan]], the [[Xinjiang cuisine|Xinjiang]] region in China and the [[Caucasus]].

[[Chuchvara]] is a very small boiled dumpling typical of Uzbek and Tajik cuisine. Made of unleavened dough squares filled with meat, it is similar to the Russian pelmeni and the Chinese wonton, but in observance of the Islamic dietary rules, the meat filling is without pork. Chuchvara can be served in a clear soup or on their own, with vinegar or sauce based on finely chopped greens, tomatoes and hot peppers. Another popular way of serving chuchvara is topped with [[suzma]] (strained [[qatiq]]) or with [[Smetana (dairy product)|smetana]] (sour cream), Russian-style.

=== Chinese ===
China boasts a wide variety of dishes that can be categorized as "dumplings," but there is no single term in Chinese that unifies all these different types. What are commonly referred to as "dumplings" in English—such as jiǎozi, wonton, and various steamed dumplings—are viewed as distinct dishes within Chinese culinary tradition.

==== Jiaozi ====
[[File:Jiaozi GS CN.jpg|thumb|Jiaozi]]
The ''[[jiaozi|jiǎozi]]'' ({{Audio|Zh-jiǎozi.ogg|餃子|help=no}}) is a common Chinese dumpling, generally consisting of minced meat and finely-chopped vegetables wrapped into a dough skin. The shape is likened to that of a human [[ear]]. The skin can be either thin and elastic or thicker, and it is sometimes said that the skin of a dumpling determines its quality.<ref name="CCTV纪录">{{Citation|last=CCTV纪录|title=《舌尖上的中国》第三季 第七集 生 {{!}} CCTV纪录|date=26 February 2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj0BmKpTozI&list=PL8s15hWIAYV5W6E3JucWPOAox9n9hF032&index=7|access-date=3 March 2019|archive-date=29 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211029094804/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj0BmKpTozI&list=PL8s15hWIAYV5W6E3JucWPOAox9n9hF032&index=7|url-status=live}}</ref> Popular meat fillings include [[ground meat]] (usually [[pork]], but sometimes [[beef]] or [[Chicken as food|chicken]]), [[Shrimp and prawn as food|shrimp]], and even [[Fish as food|fish]]. Popular mixtures include pork with [[Chinese cabbage]], pork with [[Allium tuberosum|garlic chives]], pork and shrimp with vegetables, pork with [[Scallion|spring onion]], and garlic chives with [[scrambled eggs]]. Filling mixtures will vary depending on personal tastes, region, and season. According to region and season, ingredients can include oyster.<ref name="CCTV纪录" /> Jiaozi are usually [[Boiling|boiled]], [[Steaming|steamed]], or [[Frying|fried]], and they continue to be a traditional dish. In Northern China, dumplings are commonly eaten with a dipping sauce of [[vinegar]], sometimes with [[Chili oil|chilli oil]] or paste, and occasionally with some [[soy sauce]] added in.

According to legends, jiaozi were invented in the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] between 150 and 219 CE by [[Zhang Zhongjing]], who was a popular Chinese medicine practitioner. When Zhang returned to his hometown during a harsh winter, he saw many poor people suffering from frostbite in their ears due to the bad governing of the emperor. Using his knowledge of Chinese herbs and medicine, he mixed Chinese medicinal herbs that heat up bodies with lamb and chili in doughs, folded the doughs into the shape of ears, put them in boiling water, and gave them to the poor people. After eating the wrapped dough with herbs and drinking the soup, people's frostbite heals quickly.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gallani |first=Barbara |title=Dumplings - a global history. |date=15 May 2015 |publisher=Reaktion Books |isbn=978-1-78023-433-5 |oclc=1023258969}}</ref> In memory of his help to many people, eating Jiaozi became a tradition during the winter.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Butler |first=Stephanie |title=Delightful, Delicious Dumplings |url=https://www.history.com/news/delightful-delicious-dumplings |access-date=3 October 2022 |website=HISTORY |date=23 August 2018 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date= |title=Origin of Chinese dumplings[1 |url=https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/food/2014-01/23/content_17253836.htm |access-date=18 March 2022 |website=ChinaDaily.com.cn |archive-date=15 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211215201700/https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/food/2014-01/23/content_17253836.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> Written records show that ''jiaozi'' became popular during the Southern and Northern dynasties (420–589 CE) in China, and the earliest unearthed real ''jiaozi'' were found in [[Astana Cemetery]] dated between 499 CE and 640 CE.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chen |first1=T. |last2=Wu |first2=Y. |last3=Zhang |first3=Y. |last4=Wang |first4=B. |last5=Hu |first5=Y. |last6=Wang |first6=C. |last7=Jiang |first7=H. |date=2012 |title=Archaeobotanical Study of Ancient Food and Cereal Remains at the Astana Cemeteries, Xinjiang, China |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=7 |issue=9 |article-number=e45137 |bibcode=2012PLoSO...745137C |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0045137 |pmc=3447823 |pmid=23028807 |doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=新疆出土现时我国最早的饺子_藏趣逸闻_新浪收藏_新浪网 |url=http://collection.sina.com.cn/cqyw/20120127/090953724.shtml |access-date=26 May 2022 |archive-date=14 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230114200101/http://collection.sina.com.cn/cqyw/20120127/090953724.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== Wonton ====
The ''[[wonton]]'' (Cantonese name) or ''húntun'' in Mandarin (雲呑/餛飩) is another kind of dumpling, similar in shape to the Italian [[Tortellini|tortellino]]. It is typically made with a meat or shrimp filling and boiled in a light [[broth]] or [[soup]].

==== Tangbao ====
[[File:Chinese soup dumplings.jpg|alt=Image of chinese soup dumplings in bamboo steamer basket|thumb|Chinese soup dumplings in bamboo steamer basket]]
[[Tangbao]] are Chinese dumplings filled with soup; the most famous of these are the steamed [[xiaolongbao]] (小籠包) of [[Jiangsu cuisine]]. Xiaolongbao are made of either leavened or unleavened dough, filled with minced pork or meat [[aspic]] filling, and steamed to melt the gelatinous filling back into broth.<ref>https://restaurantclicks.com/types-of-chinese-dumplings/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221023220525/https://restaurantclicks.com/types-of-chinese-dumplings/ |date=23 October 2022 }} Our Guide to Popular Chinese Dumplings</ref>

==== Yuntun ====

Yuntun and wonton have different meanings and preparation methods in different regions. In Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, "yuntun" usually refers to noodles with thin skin and less filling, often used in soups, while in the north, "wonton" generally refers to foods with thicker skin and more filling, often presented in soups or mixed foods. There are obvious differences between the two in shape, taste and use.<ref>{{Citation |title=Yuntun |work=The Free Dictionary |url=https://www.thefreedictionary.com/Yuntun |access-date=2025-03-06}}</ref>[[File:Zongzi.jpg|thumb|Zongzi wrapped in a [[bamboo]] leaf (right) and ready to eat (left)|left]]

==== Other Chinese dumplings ====

Chinese dumplings can also be based on glutinous rice instead of wheat. [[Zongzi]] (粽子), are triangular or cone-shaped, and they can be filled with [[red bean paste]], [[Jujube|Chinese dates]], or cured meat, depending on the region. Glutinous rice dumplings are traditionally eaten during the [[Dragon Boat Festival]]. However, in China Mainland, Zongzi (粽子) are not considered a type of Jiaozi (餃子) ''per se'', which is commonly translated as the word "dumpling".

[[Chinese cuisine]] also includes sweet dumplings. [[Tangyuan (food)|Tangyuan]] (湯圓) are smaller dumplings made with glutinous rice flour and filled with sweet [[sesame]], [[peanut]], or [[red bean paste]]. Tangyuan may also be served without a filling. They are eaten on the 15th day of Chinese New Year, or the [[Lantern Festival]]. In Southern China, people will also eat tangyuan with an angular shape on the Winter Solstice.<ref name="CCTV纪录"/>

Other kinds of dumplings include [[har gow]], [[fun guo]], [[Shumai|siew mai]], [[lo mai gai]], crystal dumplings, and several varieties of [[dim sum]].

=== Korean ===
Dumplings in [[Korean cuisine|Korean]] are generally called ''[[mandu (food)|mandu]]'' (만두, 饅頭) and further divided into subtypes such as ''gyoja'' (variant to Chinese [[jiaozi]]) and ''hoppang'' (variant to Chinese [[baozi]]).

But in the Korea, at past it was more part of [[Korean royal court cuisine|royal cuisine]]. Until the early Joseon Dynasty, dumplings were classified as a luxury food and even noblemen could not eat them without permission. Dumplings, noodles, and rice cakes were prohibited except for ancestral rites and Buddhist services. The first record of dumplings in Korea are seen in the Hyowooyeoljeon (효우열전/孝友列傳) in [[Goryeosa]] (고려사, 高麗史), and it is said that they were made by a naturalized [[Khitan people|Khitan]] during the reign of King [[Myeongjong of Goryeo|Myeongjong]] of [[Goryeo]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2024}}. When his father, became ill, the doctor said, 'If you eat your son's meat, you can cure your illness.' Then, he cut off his own thigh meat, mixed it with other ingredients, made dumplings, and fed it to his father. After that his father was cured. In 1185, the king heard the story of his filial piety and ordered the ministers to discuss how to reward him. He erected Hongsalmun Gate to commend him and recorded him into historical records.<ref>{{Cite web |title=당당뉴스 모바일 사이트|url=http://www.dangdangnews.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=33210 |access-date=2024-06-15 |website=www.dangdangnews.com |language=ko}}</ref>

They are typically filled with a mixture of ingredients, including ground [[pork]], [[kimchi]], [[galbi]], [[bulgogi]], vegetables, or [[cellophane noodles]], but there are many variations. Mandu can be steamed, fried, or boiled. The dumplings can also be used to make a soup called [[mandu-guk]] (만둣국).

=== Mongolian ===
[[Buuz]] (Бууз) are [[Mongolia]]n steamed dumplings derived from the Chinese [[baozi]]. They are generally made of dough, minced [[garlic]] and ground [[beef]] or ground [[Lamb and mutton|mutton]]. Originally one of the main festival foods during the [[Tsagaan Sar|Mongolian Lunar New Year]], they are now widely eaten all year. [[Khuushuur]] (хуушууp) are the [[Deep frying|deep-fried]] version of buuz. They are commonly eaten during the national festival [[Naadam]]. [[Bansh]] are smaller version of [[buuz]] and can be steamed, fried, or boiled in [[milk tea]] or [[soup]].

[[File:Slow cooked venison stew with dumplings.jpg|thumb|Irish dumplings in a [[venison]] stew]]
Savoury dumplings made from balls of dough are part of traditional [[British cuisine|British]] and [[Irish cuisine]]. Traditionally dumplings are made from twice the weight of [[self-raising flour]] to [[tallow|suet]],  bound together by cold water to form a dough and seasoned with salt and pepper but can also be made using self-raising flour and butter. Balls of this dough are dropped into a bubbling pot of [[stew]] or [[soup]], or into a [[casserole]]. They sit, partly submerged in the stew, and expand as they are half-boiled half-steamed for ten minutes or so. The cooked dumplings may be airy on the inside and moist on the outside. The dough may be flavoured with [[herb]]s, or it may have [[cheese]] pressed into its centre.

=== France ===
[[Raviole du Dauphiné]] (in English, 'Dauphiné ravioli') are a type of [[France|French]] dumpling. The regional specialty consists of two layers of pasta made out of tender wheat flour, eggs, and water, surrounding a filling of [[Comté cheese|Comté]] or [[Emmental]] cheese, cottage cheese made of cow's milk, butter and parsley. They are usually associated with the historic region of [[Dauphiné]] in South-Central France.

[[German cuisine|Germany]], [[Polish cuisine|Poland]], [[Romanian cuisine|Romania]], [[Austrian cuisine|Austria]], [[Ukrainian cuisine|Ukraine]], the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] boast a large variety of dumplings, both sweet and savoury. A dumpling is called [[Klöße|Kloß]] in northern [[Germany]], [[Knödel]], Nockerl or Knöpfle in southern Germany and [[Austria]], and [[pierogi|pieróg]] in [[Poland]]. These are flour dumplings, the most common dumplings, thin or thick, made with eggs and [[semolina]] flour, boiled in water. Meat dumplings (called Klopse or Klöpse in north-eastern Germany, Knöpfle and Nocken in [[southern Germany]]) contain meat or liver. Liver dumplings are frequent additions to soup. Thüringer Klöße are made from raw or boiled [[potato]]es, or a mixture of both, and are often filled with [[crouton]]s. [[Bread]] dumplings are made with white bread and are sometimes shaped like a loaf of bread, and boiled in a [[napkin]], in which case they are known as ''napkin dumplings'' (Serviettenknödel). Potato dumplings, known as ''Kartoffelklöße'', are common in [[Bavaria]], [[Thuringia]], and the [[Rhineland]] areas, but they are also consumed all over the country.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kartoffelklöße {{!}} Traditional Dumplings From Germany {{!}} TasteAtlas |url=https://www.tasteatlas.com/kartoffelkloe |access-date=11 August 2022 |website=www.tasteatlas.com |archive-date=11 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220811140354/https://www.tasteatlas.com/kartoffelkloe |url-status=live }}</ref> They generally consist of a combination of cooked and raw potatoes that are cooked in a salted water or pan-seared in butter. A Thuringian type of potato dumplings called ''Thüringer Klöße'', is made with potatoes and bread and is a common variation of potato dumplings. ''Kartoffelklöße'' are often served alongside roasted and braised meats, [[sauerbraten]] and [[sauerkraut]], [[goulash]] and [[Roulade|''rouladen'']].

[[Maultaschen]] are a [[Swabia]]n ([[Baden-Württemberg]]) specialty food, consisting of an outer layer of pasta dough with a filling traditionally made of sausage meat, spinach, bread crumbs and onions and flavored with various spices. Similar in appearance to Italian ravioli, Maultaschen are usually larger, however, each Maultasche being about 8–12&nbsp;cm (3–5&nbsp;inches) across.

The only potato dumpling museum in the world, the Thüringer Kloßmuseum, is in [[Heichelheim]] near [[Weimar]] in Germany.

[[Halušky]] are a traditional variety of dumplings cooked in the Central and Eastern European cuisines ([[Czech cuisine|Czech Republic]], [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungary]], [[Romanian cuisine|Romania]], [[Serbian cuisine|Serbia]], [[Slovak cuisine|Slovakia]], and [[Ukrainian cuisine|Ukraine]]). These are small lumps cut from a thick flour and egg batter and dropped into boiling water, similar to the German [[Spätzle]], [[Knöpfle]], or [[Knödel]].

In Hungary and Romania, the dumplings usually contain plums or cottage cheese and are called in Hungarian ''szilvás gombóc'', Romanian ''găluște cu prune'', or ''túrógombóc (Hungarian)'', ''colțunași cu brânză (Romanian)'', depending on the filling. Sweet dumplings are either pre-powdered, or dredged with sugar when a sweeter taste is needed. In [[Hungary]], dumplings are called ''gombóc'' and in Austria ''Zwetschgenknödel''. Sweet varieties called ''gombóc'' are made with flour and potato dough, which is wrapped around whole [[plum]]s or [[apricot]]s, and then boiled and rolled in hot buttered bread crumbs. [[Shlishkes]] or ''krumpli nudli'' are small boiled potato dumplings made from the same potato dough as sweet plum dumplings, also rolled in hot buttered bread crumbs.

{{Lang|sk|[[Bryndzové halušky]]}}, considered the Slovak national dish, are small potato dumplings without a filling, served with salty sheep's cheese on top. The same dumplings are also used to create a similar dish, ''[[strapačky]]''. Also available are their related stuffed version called [[Pierogi|pirohy]], usually filled with [[bryndza]] (''bryndzové pirohy''), [[quark cheese]], potatoes, onions, cabbage, mushrooms, or meat.

''[[Idrijski žlikrofi]]'' are [[Slovenia]]n dumplings, regionally located in the town of [[Idrija]]. They are made from dough with potato filling and have a characteristic form of a hat. Žlikrofi are made by a traditional recipe from the 19th century, but the source of the recipe is unknown due to lack of historical sources. The dish may be served as a starter or a side dish to meat based dishes. Žlikrofi were the first Slovenian food to be classified as a [[Protected Geographical Status|Traditional speciality guaranteed]] dish.

[[File:Вареники с вишней.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian [[varenyky]] filled with sour cherry]]
[[Pierogi]] of [[Poland]] and [[varenyky]] of Ukraine are ravioli-like crescent-shaped dumplings filled with savoury or sweet filling. Varenyky are usually boiled or steamed. Pierogi are often fried after boiling.

"Little ears", variously called {{lang|pl|[[uszka]]}} in Poland, {{transliteration|ru|ushki}} (ушки) in Russia, {{transliteration|uk|vushka}} (вушка) in Ukraine, and {{transliteration|be|vushki}} (вушкі) in Belarus, are folded ring-shaped dumplings similar in shape to [[tortellini|Italian tortellini]] or [[kreplach|Jewish kreplach]]. They are stuffed with meat or mushrooms and traditionally served in [[borscht|borshch]] or clear soup. In [[Romanian cuisine|Romania]], "little ears" ({{langx|ro|urechiuşe}}) are also served in dumpling soup (''supă de găluşte'')

[[File:Cepelinai.jpg|thumb|left|Lithuanian potato dumplings – [[cepelinai]]]]
[[Lithuanian cuisine|Lithuanian]] dough dumplings are called {{lang|lie|[[Kalduny|koldūnai]]}} and {{lang|lie|[[Vareniki|virtiniai]]}}. They are usually filled with meat or curd. One of the varieties is called {{lang|lie|šaltanosiai}}, "cold nosed ones", and is made with blueberry filling. There are also potato dumplings called {{lang|lie|[[cepelinai]]}} or {{lang|lie|didžkukuliai}}, filled with meat or curd inside, served with soured cream. A similar dish exists in Belarus that is called {{transliteration|be|klyocki}} (клёцкі).

Russian [[pelmeni]] are smaller than varenyky and made only of minced meat with addition of onions and spices. Sometimes the meat used is only beef, in other recipes is a mixture of beef with pork or mutton, while in [[Siberia]] the filling often includes [[venison]]. Pelmeni should be juicy inside. They are unrelated to the pasta with which they are sometimes compared as it is a savoury main dish. They are usually boiled in water with spices and salt, or in meat bouillon, sometimes fried before serving. They are often served with plenty of [[sour cream]].

[[File:Пельмени с мясом (неварёные).jpg|thumb|[[Pelmeni]] ready for boiling]]
An important difference between pelmeni, varenyky, and pierogi is the thickness of the dough shell — in pelmeni this is as thin as possible, and the proportion of filling to dough is usually higher.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://vidido.ua/index.php/poglyad/comments/pel_meniv_ne_bude_budut_ravioli/ | script-title = uk:Пельменів не буде — будуть равіолі?

Also, the fillings in pelmeni are usually raw, while the fillings of ''vareniki'' and ''pierogi'' are typically precooked.

The word ''pelmeni'' is derived from ''pel'n'an''' (пельнянь) – literally "ear bread" in the Uralic [[Komi language|Komi]], [[Udmurt language|Udmurt]] and [[Mansi language|Mansi]] languages.<ref>[http://www.slovardalja.net/word.php?wordid=24562 Dal Dictionary Online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102190205/http://www.slovardalja.net/word.php?wordid=24562 |date=2 November 2014 }} derives the etymology of pel'men' from pel'=ear and nan'=bread in Komi and Mansi (Vogul) languages.

One theory suggests pelmeni, or stuffed boiled dumplings in general, originated in [[Siberia]], possibly a simplified adaptation of the Chinese [[Wonton]] (in some dialect is called Bāomiàn "包面"). Pelmeni are particularly good means of quickly preserving meat during long Siberian winter, especially eliminating the need to feed livestock during the long winter months.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

The main difference between pelmeni and [[Momo (dumpling)|momo]] is their size—a typical pelmeni is about {{convert|2|to|3|cm}} in diameter, whereas momo are often at least twice that size.

In [[Siberia]], especially popular with the [[Buryats|Buryat peoples]] are steamed dumplings called ''pozi'' ([[buuz]] in [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], from {{lang-zh|c=包子|p=bāozi}}). They are usually made with an unleavened dough, but are often encountered leavened. The traditional filling is meat, but the kind of meat and how it is processed varies. In [[Mongolia]], mutton is favored, and is chopped rather than ground; pork and beef mixes are more popular in Russia.

[[Manti (dumpling)|Manti]], [[samosa|samsa]], [[chiburekki]], and [[belyash]]i are all popular imported dumplings.

[[Filled pasta]]s such as [[ravioli]] and [[tortellini]] fit the basic definition of a dumpling: these are pockets of pasta enclosing various fillings (cheese, mushrooms, [[spinach]], seafood, or meat).  Instead of being made from a ball of dough, the dough is rolled flat, cut into a shape, filled with other ingredients, and then the dough is closed around the filling.

[[Seada]]s is a type of savoury dessert which is a semolina dumpling filled with [[Pecorino sardo]].

[[Gnocchi]] is a different kind of Italian dumpling. The word ''gnocchi'' literally means "lumps", and they are rolled and shaped from a mixture of egg with potato, [[semolina]], flour, or [[Ricotta|ricotta cheese]] (with or without [[spinach]]). The lumps are boiled in water and served with melted butter, grated cheese, or other [[pasta sauce]]s. Gnocchi are frequently added to soup.

In [[Norwegian cuisine]], dumplings have a vast variety of names, as the dialects differ substantially. Names include ''potetball'', ''klubb'', ''kløbb'', ''raspeball'', ''komle'', ''kumle'', ''kompe'', ''kumpe'', ''kodla'', ''kudle'', ''klot'', ''kams'', ''ball'', ''baill'', ''komperdøse'', ''kumperdøse'', ''kompadøs'', ''ruter'', ''ruta'', ''raskekako'', ''risk'', ''klotremat'', ''krumme'' and ''kromme''. They are usually made from crushed potatoes mixed with various types of flour, often with an emphasis on barley and wheat. In some local recipes the potatoes are dehydrated, while in others there is a mixture of raw and boiled potatoes. Occasionally they are filled with salted pork. Depending on local tradition, dumplings can be sided with syrup, [[lingonberry]] jam, [[Rutabaga|swede]] and often meat if the dumplings do not have meat filling. Leftovers are often fried in butter and served with granulated sugar.

When the potato is mixed with [[wheat flour]], which is more common in southern [[Sweden]], it is called ''[[kroppkaka]]''.

[[File:Palt exterior.jpg|thumb|Swedish ''palt'', served with butter and lingonberry jam.]]
When the potato is mixed with [[barley]] flour, which is traditional in northern Sweden, it is known as ''[[palt]]'' in [[Lapland (Sweden)|Lapland]], [[Västerbotten]] and [[Norrbotten]],<ref name=kokboken /> and as ''kams'' in [[Jämtland]], [[Ångermanland]] and [[Medelpad]].<ref name=kokboken /><ref name=Smaka>{{cite web | url = http://smakasverige.jordbruksverket.se/produkter/produktarkiv/paltkams.328.html | work = Smaka Sverige | title = Palt/Kams | language = sv | access-date = 13 April 2015 | archive-date = 4 March 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304080704/http://smakasverige.jordbruksverket.se/produkter/produktarkiv/paltkams.328.html | url-status = live }}</ref> Originally, ''palt'' was eaten all over Sweden and was made from barley or rye flour alone, but during the 19th century, when potato was added and wheat became more common and inexpensive, the northern recipes retained the original name, while ''kroppkaka'', which had always been the name used on Öland for the flour dumpling, became the name for the variant in southern Sweden.<ref name=SmakaKropp>{{cite web | url = http://smakasverige.jordbruksverket.se/produkter/produktarkiv/kroppkakor.306.html | work = Smaka Sverige | title = Kroppkakor | language = sv | access-date = 13 April 2015 | archive-date = 29 October 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151029192729/http://smakasverige.jordbruksverket.se/produkter/produktarkiv/kroppkakor.306.html }}</ref>

''Palt'' and ''kams'' is usually filled with diced, unsmoked bacon. However, sometimes fried bacon is served on the side of unfilled ''palt'' or ''kams'', which then is known as {{lang|sv|flatpalt}} or {{lang|sv|flatkams}}, as the lack of filling makes it flatter. The most well-known ''palt'' variant is the [[Pitepalt]] from [[Piteå]]. In [[Dalarna]], where the dish is known as ''klabbe'', it is still made without potatoes and is never filled. ''Klabbe'' is instead served with diced bacon on the side.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.matklubben.se/recept/klabbe_med_flaesk_och_messmoersaas_87337.html#.VSvx6M7AGzo | work = Matklubben | title = Klabbe med fläsk och messmörsås | language = sv | access-date = 13 April 2015 | trans-title = Dumplings with pork and mess butter ({{ill|Messmör|sv}}) sauce}}</ref>

A variant of ''palt'' is ''[[blodpalt]]'', where pig, beef or reindeer blood is mixed into the dough. Other ''palt'' variants are {{lang|sv|leverpalt}}, with minced liver added to the dough, and {{lang|sv|njurpalt}}, with diced kidney mixed into the bacon filling.<ref name=kokboken /> ''Blodpalt'' also existed across the country originally, and has been found in [[Iron Age]] graves in [[Halland]].<ref name=Smaka />

The filled ''kroppkaka'', ''palt'' or ''kams'' ball – as well as the flatter, unfilled {{lang|sv|flatpalt}}, {{lang|sv|flatkams}} and {{lang|sv|klabbe}} – is dropped into boiling salted water and cooked until it floats. It is traditionally served warm with melted [[butter]] and [[lingonberry jam]], although in some parts of southern Sweden the melted butter is replaced by [[half cream]] (a mix of milk and cream) or a warm milk sauce, and in parts of northern Sweden the butter is replaced by a warm milk sauce spiced with [[messmör]]. Leftover ''kroppkaka'' is often served halved and fried.<ref name=kokboken />

Unfilled flour dumplings for use in soup are called ''klimp'' if the flour is wheat, but ''mjölpalt'' if the flour is barley or rye.<ref name=kokboken />

The khinkali is typically consumed first by sucking the juices while taking the first bite, in order to prevent the dumpling from bursting.

This was especially true for states like the Carolinas, where it began to supersede both regional Indigenous and African-American recipes that previously used a corn base. Precursors include savory, [[cornmeal]] dumplings with [[Soul food|turnip greens]] as well as Indigenous [[Pone (food)|pone]] (in English, meaning 'baked') that dates back as early as the [[Woodland period|Woodland Period]] and fruit-based 'slump'.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Friend |first=Nina |date=16 November 2023 |title="Native American 'Slump': Puffy Dumplings in Simmered Fruit." |url=https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20231114-native-american-slump-puffy-dumplings-in-simmered-fruit. |website=BBC News}}</ref> Thus American dumplings can either be of the filled pastry type (which are usually baked), or they may be little pieces of dough added to a savory or sweet dish, in which case they are usually boiled.

'''Baked dumplings'''

Baked sweet dumplings are a popular dessert in American cuisine. They are made by wrapping [[fruit]], frequently a whole tart [[apple]], in pastry, then baking until the pastry is browned and the filling is tender. While baking, the dumplings may be surrounded by, and even basted in, a sweet [[sauce]], typically containing [[brown sugar]], butter, and cinnamon or other spices. Baked savory dumplings, in the form of [[pizza rolls]], are a popular prepared snack food.

'''Boiled dumplings'''

Boiled dumplings are made by mixing flour, fat, and baking powder with milk or water to form a dough, which may be either rolled out and cut into bite-size pieces, or simply dropped by spoonfuls into the simmering liquid of a savoury soup or stew, or, for dessert dumplings, onto simmering sweetened fruit. The dropped kind are sometimes called "doughboys". When added to chicken and vegetables in chicken broth, the starch in the dumplings serves to thicken the broth into a gravy, creating the popular comfort food [[chicken and dumplings]]. Other common savoury pairings, particularly in the Midwestern and Southern US, are turkey, ham, and butterbeans. Popular sweet pairings are strawberries, apples, and blackberries. Dumplings also feature in the regional stews of the midwest and south called "burgoos." Further north, dumplings are frequently served with beef, corned-beef and duck stews, and blueberries are the favourite fruit for dessert dumplings.

[[File:Plateful of Momo in Nepal.jpg|thumb|Plateful of [[Momo (food)]] in [[Nepal]]]]

In [[Nepal]], steamed dumplings known as [[Momo (food)|momo]] are a popular snack, often eaten as a full meal as well. They are similar to the Chinese [[jiaozi]] or the Central Asian [[manti (dumpling)|manti]]. Whether momos originated in Tibet and spread to Nepal or vice versa is unclear, but momos were present in Nepal as early as the fourteenth century.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web| url=https://neweverestcuisine.com/news/f/the-history-of-momo-the-king-of-fast-food-dumpling| title=The history of MOMO (The king of fast food-Dumpling)| access-date=2023-01-16| archive-date=2023-01-21| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230121042730/https://neweverestcuisine.com/news/f/the-history-of-momo-the-king-of-fast-food-dumpling| url-status=live}}</ref> Momos are one of the most common items on the menus of Nepali restaurants, especially in the [[Kathmandu Valley]].

Common fillings for momos are meat, vegetables, and cheese: sweet dessert momo are also made. Momo can be served fried, steamed or grilled. They are usually served with a dipping sauce, known as [[South Asian pickle|achar]], normally consisting of tomatoes and chillies as the base ingredient, from which numerous variations can be made. Soups with momo are common: both the Nepali [[jhol momo]] and the Tibetan [[mokthuk]] are examples.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lama |first1=Tsering Ngodup |title=An essential guide to thukpas |url=https://kathmandupost.com/food/2019/10/04/an-essential-guide-to-thukpas |website=The Kathmandu Post |access-date=25 April 2023 |archive-date=25 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230425100813/https://kathmandupost.com/food/2019/10/04/an-essential-guide-to-thukpas |url-status=live }}</ref>
